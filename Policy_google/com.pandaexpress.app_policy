In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.
15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND PANDA CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND PANDA TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY CONCERNING ANY DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE WHICH IS COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND ARE INSTEAD AGREEING TO SUBMIT ANY SUCH DISPUTE SOLELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF TO AN IMPARTIAL ARBITRATOR.
15.1 Agreement to Arbitrate
You and Panda mutually agree to forego the delay and expense of using a court of law and choose instead to benefit from impartial dispute resolution procedure of using binding arbitration for any “Covered Claims” (as defined below) that arise between you and Panda, and/or any current or former employee, officer, or director of Panda sued for acts or omissions taken in the capacity of Panda’s agent, representative or employee. You and Panda agree that this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and will survive even after these Terms terminate. Any revision to or termination of these Terms that modify or terminate this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall not apply to an arbitration pending at the time of the revision, except as may be required by applicable law.
15.2 Claims Subject to Arbitration
Other than the exceptions in the “Excluded Claims” Section below, the “Covered Claims” include any and all controversies, disputes, disagreements, and claims arising out of, or relating to, these Terms (including its enforcement, breach, performance, interpretation, validity, or termination), or your access to and/or use of the Services, or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site to the fullest extent allowed by law, including but not limited to such controversies, disputes, disagreements, and claims that pre-date your agreement to these Terms.
15.3 Excluded Claims
15.3.1 The Covered Claims do not include (and thus shall not require arbitration of) the following types of claims that will hereafter be referred to as “Excluded Claims”: (a) any claims that cannot be required to be arbitrated as a matter of California law subject to federal preemption (including claims or charges that must be filed with a governmental administrative agency); (b) applications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders, including but not limited to those relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; and (c) small claims actions demanding $10,000 or less brought on an individual basis and within a small claims court’s jurisdiction.
15.3.2 In the event you or Panda choose to pursue arbitration of both Covered Claims and Excluded Claims and the other party objects, the Covered Claims must be arbitrated. In no event will Covered Claims be joined with Excluded Claims and litigated in court unless both parties agree to waive arbitration.
15.4 Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver
You and Panda agree to arbitrate any Covered Claims only on an individual basis and hereby waive any right to bring, participate in, or receive money or any other relief from any representative, class, or collective proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”).
No party may bring a claim on behalf of other individuals, and no arbitrator hearing any claim under these Terms may: (a) without the consent of all parties, combine more than one individual’s claim or claims into a single case; (b) order, require, participate in, or facilitate production of class-wide contact information or notification of others of potential claims; or (c) arbitrate any form of a class, collective, or representative proceeding.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial (“Jury Trial Waiver”). This Jury Trial Waiver shall not apply, and shall be severed from this Agreement, if it is not permissible under applicable laws or otherwise found to be unenforceable, including presently California.
15.5 Arbitrability Determinations
If a party violates the agreement to arbitrate by commencing an action asserting a Covered Claim in a court of law, then the court (and not an arbitrator) shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation, formation, existence, enforceability, validity, and scope of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver. If a party complies with the agreement to arbitrate and files for arbitration without filing a complaint in a court of law, then the arbitrator shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver for purposes of discovery or the merits of the underlying claim, but shall have no authority to resolve any disputes about the formation, existence, enforceability, or validity of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, including the Class Action Waiver.
15.6 Arbitration Rules, Procedures, and Costs
For any Covered Claim that you have against Panda, or Panda has against you, the claiming party may, voluntarily and at its election, contact the other party and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of the claim (“Notice”). If such Notice is being sent to Panda, it shall be sent by email at GuestCare@pandarg.com or by certified mail addressed to:
Attn: Corporate Legal Team
Panda Restaurant Group, Inc.
1683 Walnut Grove Avenue
Rosemead, CA 91770
If the Notice is being sent to a party other than Panda, it shall be sent to the last known (by the claiming party) email or street address of the other party. The Notice should (a) include the claiming party’s name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Covered Claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Each party agrees to attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute. If you and Panda cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Covered Claim, then the party desiring to pursue a legal dispute must prepare a written demand setting forth the claim(s) and deliver the written demand within the applicable statute of limitations period by hand or first class mail to the address above. You and Panda agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by AAA. The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA under its rules and procedures (provided such location is reasonably convenient to you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed to by you and Panda. Except to the extent that they are modified by the rules below, if you are an individual person, the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules that are in effect at the time of the filing of the demand will apply.
15.6.1 The parties agree that the applicable AAA rules are modified as follows:
15.6.2 Any arbitrator must be neutral as to all parties. Standards for the recusal of an arbitrator shall be the same standards under which trial judges are recused under California law.
15.6.3 No party is entitled to its attorneys’ fees, except as may be awarded in a matter authorized by and consistent with applicable law.
15.6.4 All discovery shall be subject to any and all objections available under FRCP 26(b). Each party shall avoid broad or widespread collection, search, and production of documents, including electronically stored information (“ESI”). If a compelling need is demonstrated by the requesting party, the production shall: (i) be narrowly tailored in scope; (ii) only come from sources that are reasonably accessible without undue burden or cost; and (iii) be produced in a searchable format, if possible without undue burden or cost, and which is usable by the receiving party and convenient and economical for the producing party. Where the costs and burdens of the requested discovery outweigh its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, the arbitrator shall deny such requests or order production on condition that the requesting party advance to the producing party the reasonable costs involved in making the production, subject to the allocation of costs in the final award.
15.6.5 The arbitrator shall have the authority to award the same damages and other relief that would have been available in court pursuant to the law governing the Covered Claim(s).
15.6.6 Either party shall have the right to file motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment/adjudication.
15.6.7 The arbitrator shall have the authority to issue an award or partial award without conducting a hearing on the grounds that there is no claim on which relief can be granted or that there is no genuine issue of material fact to resolve at a hearing.
15.6.8 The Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to all arbitration proceedings.
15.6.9 For discovery purposes only, an arbitrator may consolidate claims filed by multiple individuals, each on their own behalf, in a single arbitration proceeding, or may conduct a joint hearing for efficiency purposes, so long as the arbitrator does not (a) certify (conditionally or otherwise) a collective, class, or representative action that includes individuals who have not themselves already submitted their own individual claims, or (b) authorize the issuance of notice of the arbitration to individuals on the grounds that the arbitrator or any party believes there are other individuals who are similarly situated to or share commonality with a party to the arbitration.
15.6.10 The arbitrator must issue a decision in writing, setting forth in summary form the reasons for the arbitrator’s determination and the legal basis therefor.
15.6.11 The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to deciding the case submitted by the parties to the arbitration. Therefore, no decision by any arbitrator shall serve as precedent in other arbitrations except to preclude the same claim from being re-arbitrated between the same parties.
15.6.12 The parties may settle any dispute on a mutual basis without involvement of the arbitrator.
15.6.13 If you initiate arbitration, you will pay the first $250, and Panda will pay all other filing, administrative, or hearing fees. If Panda initiates arbitration, Panda will pay all filing, administrative, and hearing fees. Regardless of which party initiates arbitration, you will remain responsible for your attorneys’ fees and costs unless the law governing the Covered Claim provides for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs and the arbitrator determines as part of the arbitration award that you may recover a certain amount of attorneys’ fees and costs.
15.6.14 A party may make an offer of judgment in a manner consistent with, and within the time limitations, consequences, and effects provided in Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The offer shall be served on the offeree in the same manner in which other papers are served in the arbitral proceeding. The offer shall not be served on the arbitrator, except that if the offer is accepted, either party may then file with the arbitrator the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof. The arbitrator shall then immediately render an award as provided by the offer, and the arbitration proceedings shall then be terminated. If the offer is not accepted, the offer shall not be used as evidence in the arbitration proceedings and, following the issuance of the arbitrator’s award, the offeror may file a motion for costs with the arbitrator, who shall retain jurisdiction to decide the motion and award costs to the offeror as warranted.
15.7 Mass Arbitration (inapplicable in California and in any other jurisdiction where this term is prohibited by law).
A “Mass Arbitration” shall be defined as any one of the following: (i) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, files or causes to be filed 30 or more Covered Claims within a thirty-day period; (ii) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, files or causes to be filed 50 or more Covered Claims within a sixty-day period; (iii) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, serves as counsel (regardless of whether the lawyer or law firm is counsel of record) for 30 or more persons who file a Covered Claim within a thirty-day period; or (iv) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, serves as counsel (regardless of whether the lawyer or law firm is counsel of record) for 50 or more persons who file a Covered Claim within a sixty-day period. In the event of a Mass Arbitration, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 15.6.13. above, Panda shall (i) not be required to advance or pay arbitration costs for any arbitration and (ii) may be awarded its reasonable attorney fees, expert fees, and costs if it prevails (without having to show that your claim was frivolous or in bad faith) if such recovery is authorized under applicable law. The immediately preceding sentence shall apply only to those arbitrations that are filed once the definition of Mass Arbitration is met. Thus, by way of example, if the same law firm files 35 Covered Claims within a thirty-day period, the first 29 Covered Claims shall be governed by subpart Section 15.6.12 and the last six Covered Claims (i.e., arbitration numbers 30 through 35) shall be governed by this Section 15.7. Once a law firm or lawyer is deemed part of a Mass Arbitration, all Covered Claims he/she/it files, assists in filing, or causes to be filed shall be governed by this Section 15.7 unless and until the law firm or lawyer does not file, assists in filing, or causes to be filed any Covered Claims for a period of one year. This section 15.7 is inapplicable in California and in any other jurisdiction where this term is prohibited by law.
15.8 Severability
If any term or condition in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is determined to be unenforceable or in conflict with a mandatory provision of applicable law, it shall be construed to incorporate any mandatory provision, or the unenforceable or conflicting term or condition shall be automatically severed and the remainder of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall not be affected.
16. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE
Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
17. MODIFYING AND TERMINATING OUR SERVICES
We reserve the right to modify our Services or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our Services at any time. You also have the right to stop using our Services at any time. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.
18. UPDATES TO THESE TERMS
We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes through our Services or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services.
19. SEVERABILITY
If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
20. MISCELLANEOUS
The failure of Panda to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements and understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.

here

Calling us at (800) 877-8988 (toll free).

DO-NOT-SELL AND LIMIT THE USE
California consumers have the right to opt-out of our “sale” or “sharing” of their California Personal Information when California Personal Information is shared with a third party for a purpose that is not a “business purpose” as set out under applicable law. To exercise your opt-out rights, click
here
and submit your request using the Privacy Rights Form.  We do not “sell” California Personal Information about consumers that we know are younger than 16 years old without opt-in consent. Finally, California consumers also have the right to "limit the use" of their sensitive personal information. Panda only collects, uses, and discloses your sensitive personal information to provide services to you, therefore Panda is not required to provide this link.
In addition, we have configured our cookie management tool to honor opt-out preference signals sent by Global Privacy Control ("GPC") within the browser. Due to technical limitations, the GPC signal is only honored within the particular browser.  Beyond GPC, we do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that indicate your preference for not having information collected over time and across different Web sites or digital apps following your visit to one of our Sites.

NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE
The Panda Rewards Program (“Rewards Program”) is a rewards program that allows registered members to earn Panda Points from Qualifying Purchases and can be applied towards the purchase of eligible food and drink once you have earned the required number of Panda Points to do so.  We may at any time hold contests or provide special offers ("Programs") to users in our database who have elected to let us contact them by e-mail, text messaging, direct messaging, or through social media. Participation is voluntary, and you always have the option to not supply information and/or to opt out. Information collected may include contact information, demographic information and opinions. Information may be used by third parties working on our behalf to contact you if you have won a contest, send special offers, or help us to determine the likes and preferences of consumers to better enhance our food, restaurants, overall customer experience, websites, and marketing. Because our Programs involve the collection of personally identifiable information, they might be interpreted as a "financial incentive" program under California law. Panda is unable to assign an independent monetary value to the personal information we collect in connection with our Programs due to many factors, including, without limitation (a) the number of dollars spent and points accumulated, (b) the rewards redeemed, (c) the frequency in which a consumer uses any rewards, (d) whether or not participants collect points, (e) motivating factors of any purchase, or (f) level of engagement of any Program participants.  In general, however, Panda estimates in good faith that the value of your personal information to us is less than the value of the perks provided in the Program less other factors, including, but not limited to, the expense related to offering those products, services, and benefits to Program participants. You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program terms and conditions. To the extent Panda engages in financial incentives in connection with Programs, we will provide information describing the material terms of the program and will obtain opt-in consent from users before they participate. Users can opt-out from a program at any time by following the instructions provided in such terms.
DATA RETENTION
We keep your California Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted according to the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include (i) for as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you; (ii) as required by a legal obligation to which we are subject to; or (iii) as advisable considering our legal position (such as in regard of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).  We may remove California Personal Information for inactive accounts from our database, subject to any applicable legal or regulatory obligations. Furthermore, we may delete California Personal Information from our database at any time and without providing any reason.
SHINE THE LIGHT LAW

1. Membership
Panda Rewards is available to legal residents of the United States where Panda has made the Panda Rewards available. Panda Rewards is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 13. All Members must be at least 13 years of age. For any legal resident of the United States who is not at least 18 years of age or older at the time of registration, a parent or guardian must review, agree, and be responsible for compliance with the Terms. Membership requires a valid email address to enroll. You may also elect to provide other information, including your birthday.

Individuals must enroll separately and may not pool or combine points with other Members. Panda reserves the right to limit participation at any time. A Member’s account must be in “Good Standing” in order to receive the benefits of the Program. “Good Standing” means the account is not banned, suspended or deactivated.
2. Rewards Program
Panda Rewards is a guest rewards program that allows registered Members to earn points for purchases that can be redeemed for menu items (“Rewards”), which are subject to availability at Participating Locations (See section 2.2(a)). One (1) “Panda Point” is awarded for every ten cents ($0.10) spent on Qualifying Purchases (based on total after discounts, excluding applicable taxes and fees) and/or Donations (See section 2.4(g)). “Qualifying Purchase(s)” is a purchase of food, beverage or in-store merchandise equal to or greater than one cent ($0.01) Panda Points can be applied towards the purchase of eligible food and drink once you have earned the required number of Panda Points to do so. See section 2.4(a) for purchases that are not considered Qualifying Purchases. There is no fee to join the Program. Participation in the Program is for personal use only, and may not be sold, transferred, assigned to, or shared with, family, friends or others, or used for any commercial purpose, except as otherwise provided for in these Terms. You may have only one (1) Panda Rewards account that is personal to you.
2.1. Account Identification to Receive Panda Points
(a) To receive credit for your in-store transaction, your account must be identified at the time of purchase. If ordering in-store, you will be required to sign into the Panda Express mobile application to scan your Member QR code or provide your telephone number (telephone number must match with the telephone number listed in your account) at the point of checkout. Your Member QR Code or telephone number is necessary to get credit for any Panda Points you may be entitled to.
(b) If you order on the Panda Express website or via the Panda Express mobile application, you must be logged into your Member account in order to receive Panda Points.
(c) In the event you have forgotten to identify yourself as a Member while making a Qualifying Purchase, you may claim Panda Points by entering the unique rewards code found on your receipt into your account. This can be done online at PandaExpress.com, or via the Panda Express mobile application. ALL CLAIMS FOR PANDA POINTS AFTER PURCHASE MUST BE SUBMITTED TO PANDA WITHIN SEVEN (7) DAYS OF THE PURCHASE DATE.
2.2. Panda Points
(a) Panda Points are earned at participating Panda Express locations (“Participating Locations”). Participating Locations currently exclude Panda Express locations in hospitals, airports, sports arenas, or similar locations. Be sure to check that a location is participating prior to making an order. Panda Points are earned for a Qualifying Purchase and/or Donation (See section 2.2(g)). In some cases, it may take twenty-four (24) hours or more for Panda Points to be credited to a Member’s account. Panda may modify the number of Panda Points needed to earn any Reward (as defined below) and will communicate that change to all Members prior to its implementation. Panda Points earned on orders placed for a future time/date will remain in a pending state until the order has been completed. Panda Points for any single Qualifying Purchase and/or Donation may only be credited to the Member account associated with the Qualifying Purchase and/or Donation.
(b) Panda shall not be responsible for any losses, costs or expenses incurred by a delay or error in crediting Panda Points. Panda Points are purely promotional and have no cash value and are not redeemable toward cash, gift certificates or gift cards. All Panda Points in a Member’s account expire after one (1) year (365 days) if there has been no Qualifying Purchase associated with the Member’s account.
(c) All Panda Points in a Member’s account expire upon termination, deactivation or closure of the account. Panda reserves the right to adjust point earning and redemption values at any time. Panda reserves the right to terminate, deactivate or close a Member’s account that has been inactive for 24 consecutive months without notice to Member, unless otherwise required by law. A Member’s account is considered inactive if no Qualifying Purchase has been made in connection with such Member’s account (as determined by Panda in its sole and absolute discretion on the basis of its records). In the event that your account is terminated, deactivated or closed, then all Panda Points, any Rewards or other benefits associated with the Member’s account will be cancelled and deactivated.
(d) Panda Points are only earned when using a gift card, not on the purchase of, unless there is a promotion to earn Panda Points for gift card purchases.
(e) Canceling or voiding Qualifying Purchases will deduct any earned Panda Points for that Qualifying Purchase.
(f) From time to time, we may offer Members opportunities to earn extra Panda Points, “Bonus Panda Points,” through special promotions. These promotional Bonus Panda Points will be awarded as described in the applicable promotional offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth in such promotional offer.
(g) A “Donation(s)” refers to any monetary contribution to the Panda Cares Foundation either at the time of making a Qualified Purchase, when redeeming Rewards, or while in-store. Donations, whether made online or in-store, accrue Panda Points at the same rate as a Qualifying Purchase.
2.3. Panda Points Calculation
Panda Points earned on Qualifying Purchases will be rounded up to the nearest whole number.
Example 1 (Qualifying Purchase): A Qualifying Purchase of $6.41 will earn 65 Panda Points. $6.41 x 10 Panda Points per dollar = 64.10 Panda Points; rounded to the nearest whole number for a total of 65 Panda Points earned.
Example 2 (Qualifying Purchase and Donation): A Qualifying Purchase of $6.41 with a $5.00 Donation will earn 115 Panda Points. ($6.41 + $5.00) x 10 Panda Points per dollar = 114.1 Panda Points; rounded to the nearest whole number for a total of 115 Panda Points earned.
Example: A Qualifying Purchase of $6.41 will earn 65 Panda Points. $6.41 x 10 Panda Points per dollar = 64.10 Panda Points; rounded to the nearest whole number for a total of 65 Panda Points earned.
2.4. Panda Point Restrictions
There are certain restrictions and limitations on Panda Points.
(a) Items not eligible for earning Panda Points include:
Tax, Tip, Delivery Fees, Service Fees;

All such instances may be subject to additional terms set forth at the time of offering.

EXCEPT FOR ANY SPECIFIC WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN PANDA REWARDS OR IN ADDITIONAL TERMS PROVIDED BY PANDA, PANDA HEREBY FURTHER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES, TITLE, CUSTOM, TRADE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS.
12. Dispute Resolution, Binding Arbitration
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND PANDA CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND PANDA TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY CONCERNING ANY DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE WHICH IS COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND ARE INSTEAD AGREEING TO SUBMIT ANY SUCH DISPUTE SOLELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF TO AN IMPARTIAL ARBITRATOR.
12.1. Agreement to Arbitrate
You and Panda mutually agree to forego the delay and expense of using a court of law and choose instead to benefit from an impartial dispute resolution procedure of using binding arbitration for any “Covered Claims” (as defined below) that arise between you and Panda, and/or any current or former employee, officer, or director of Panda sued for acts or omissions taken in the capacity of Panda’s agent, representative or employee. You and Panda agree that this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and will survive even after these Terms terminate. Any revision to or termination of these Terms that modify or terminate this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall not apply to an arbitration pending at the time of the revision, except as may be required by applicable law.
12.2. Claims Subject to Arbitration
Other than the exceptions in the “Excluded Claims” Section below, the “Covered Claims” include any and all controversies, disputes, disagreements, and claims arising out of, or relating to, these Terms (including its enforcement, breach, performance, interpretation, validity, or termination), or your access to and/or use of the Services, or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site to the fullest extent allowed by law, including but not limited to such controversies, disputes, disagreements, and claims that pre-date your agreement to these Terms.
12.3. Excluded Claims
(a) The Covered Claims do not include (and thus shall not require arbitration of) the following types of claims that will hereafter be referred to as “Excluded Claims”: (a) any claims that cannot be required to be arbitrated as a matter of California law subject to federal preemption (including claims or charges that must be filed with a governmental administrative agency); (b) applications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders, including but not limited to those relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; and (c) small claims actions demanding $10,000 or less brought on an individual basis and within a small claims court’s jurisdiction.
(b) In the event you or Panda choose to pursue arbitration of both Covered Claims and Excluded Claims and the other party objects, the Covered Claims must be arbitrated. In no event will Covered Claims be joined with Excluded Claims and litigated in court unless both parties agree to waive arbitration.
12.4. Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver
You and Panda agree to arbitrate any Covered Claims only on an individual basis and hereby waive any right to bring, participate in, or receive money or any other relief from any representative, class, or collective proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”).
No party may bring a claim on behalf of other individuals, and no arbitrator hearing any claim under these Terms may: (a) without the consent of all parties, combine more than one individual’s claim or claims into a single case; (b) order, require, participate in, or facilitate production of class-wide contact information or notification of others of potential claims; or (c) arbitrate any form of a class, collective, or representative proceeding.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial (“Jury Trial Waiver”). This Jury Trial Waiver shall not apply, and shall be severed from this Agreement, if it is not permissible under applicable laws or otherwise found to be unenforceable, including presently California.
12.5. Arbitrability Determinations
If a party violates the agreement to arbitrate by commencing an action asserting a Covered Claim in a court of law, then the court (and not an arbitrator) shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation, formation, existence, enforceability, validity, and scope of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver. If a party complies with the agreement to arbitrate and files for arbitration without filing a complaint in a court of law, then the arbitrator shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver for purposes of discovery or the merits of the underlying claim, but shall have no authority to resolve any disputes about the formation, existence, enforceability, or validity of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, including the Class Action Waiver.
12.6. Arbitration Rules, Procedures, and Costs
For any Covered Claim that you have against Panda, or Panda has against you, the claiming party may, voluntarily and at its election, contact the other party and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of the claim (“Notice”). If such Notice is being sent to Panda, it shall be sent by email to GuestCare@pandarg.com or by certified mail addressed to:
Attn: Corporate Legal Team
Panda Restaurant Group, Inc.
1683 Walnut Grove Avenue
Rosemead, CA 91770
If the Notice is being sent to a party other than Panda, it shall be sent to the last known (by the claiming party) email or street address of the other party. The Notice should: (a) include the claiming party’s name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Covered Claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Each party agrees to attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute. If you and Panda cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Covered Claim, then the party desiring to pursue a legal dispute must prepare a written demand setting forth the claim(s) and deliver the written demand within the applicable statute of limitations period by hand or first-class mail to the address above. You and Panda agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by AAA. The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA under its rules and procedures (provided such location is reasonably convenient to you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed to by you and Panda. Except to the extent that they are modified by the rules below, if you are an individual person, the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules that are in effect at the time of the filing of the demand will apply.
(a)The parties agree that the applicable AAA rules are modified as follows:
Any arbitrator must be neutral as to all parties. Standards for the recusal of an arbitrator shall be the same standards under which trial judges are recused under California law.
No party is entitled to its attorneys’ fees, except as may be awarded in a matter authorized by and consistent with applicable law.
All discovery shall be subject to any and all objections available under FRCP 26(b). Each party shall avoid broad or widespread collection, search, and production of documents, including electronically stored information (“ESI”). If a compelling need is demonstrated by the requesting party, the production shall: (i) be narrowly tailored in scope; (ii) only come from sources that are reasonably accessible without undue burden or cost; and (iii) be produced in a searchable format, if possible, without undue burden or cost, and which is usable by the receiving party and convenient and economical for the producing party. Where the costs and burdens of the requested discovery outweigh its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, the arbitrator shall deny such requests or order production on condition that the requesting party advance to the producing party the reasonable costs involved in making the production, subject to the allocation of costs in the final award.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award the same damages and other relief that would have been available in court pursuant to the law governing the Covered Claim(s).
Either party shall have the right to file motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment/adjudication.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to issue an award or partial award without conducting a hearing on the grounds that there is no claim on which relief can be granted or that there is no genuine issue of material fact to resolve at a hearing.
The Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to all arbitration proceedings.
For discovery purposes only, an arbitrator may consolidate claims filed by multiple individuals, each on their own behalf, in a single arbitration proceeding, or may conduct a joint hearing for efficiency purposes, so long as the arbitrator does not: (a) certify (conditionally or otherwise) a collective, class, or representative action that includes individuals who have not themselves already submitted their own individual claims; or (b) authorize the issuance of notice of the arbitration to individuals on the grounds that the arbitrator or any party believes there are other individuals who are similarly situated to or share commonality with a party to the arbitration.
The arbitrator must issue a decision in writing, setting forth in summary form the reasons for the arbitrator’s determination and the legal basis, therefore.
The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to deciding the case submitted by the parties to the arbitration. Therefore, no decision by any arbitrator shall serve as precedent in other arbitrations except to preclude the same claim from being re-arbitrated between the same parties.
The parties may settle any dispute on a mutual basis without involvement of the arbitrator.
If you initiate arbitration, you will pay the first $250, and Panda will pay all other filing, administrative, or hearing fees. If Panda initiates arbitration, Panda will pay all filing, administrative, and hearing fees. Regardless of which party initiates arbitration, you will remain responsible for your attorneys’ fees and costs unless the law governing the Covered Claim provides for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs and the arbitrator determines as part of the arbitration award that you may recover a certain amount of attorneys’ fees and costs.
A party may make an offer of judgment in a manner consistent with, and within the time limitations, consequences, and effects provided in Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The offer shall be served on the offeree in the same manner in which other papers are served in the arbitral proceeding. The offer shall not be served on the arbitrator, except if the offer is accepted, either party may then file with the arbitrator the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof. The arbitrator shall then immediately render an award as provided by the offer, and the arbitration proceedings shall then be terminated. If the offer is not accepted, the offer shall not be used as evidence in the arbitration proceedings and, following the issuance of the arbitrator’s award, the offeror may file a motion for costs with the arbitrator, who shall retain jurisdiction to decide the motion and award costs to the offeror as warranted.
12.7. Mass Arbitration (inapplicable in California and in any other jurisdiction where this term is prohibited by law).
A “Mass Arbitration” shall be defined as any one of the following: (i) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, files or causes to be filed 30 or more Covered Claims within a thirty-day period; (ii) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, files or causes to be filed 50 or more Covered Claims within a sixty-day period; (iii) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, serves as counsel (regardless of whether the lawyer or law firm is counsel of record) for 30 or more persons who file a Covered Claim within a thirty-day period; or (iv) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, serves as counsel (regardless of whether the lawyer or law firm is counsel of record) for 50 or more persons who file a Covered Claim within a sixty-day period. In the event of a Mass Arbitration, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12.6(a)(xii) above, Panda shall: (i) not be required to advance or pay arbitration costs for any arbitration; and (ii) may be awarded its reasonable attorney fees, expert fees, and costs if it prevails (without having to show that your claim was frivolous or in bad faith) provided that such recovery is authorized under applicable law. The immediately preceding sentence shall apply only to those arbitrations that are filed once the definition of Mass Arbitration is met. Thus, by way of example, if the same law firm files 35 Covered Claims within a thirty-day period, the first 29 Covered Claims shall be governed by subpart Section 12.6(a)(xii) and the last six Covered Claims (i.e., arbitration numbers 30 through 35) shall be governed by this Section 12.7. Once a law firm or lawyer is deemed part of a Mass Arbitration, all Covered Claims he/she/it files, assists in filing, or causes to be filed shall be governed by this Section 12.7 unless and until the law firm or lawyer does not file, assists in filing, or causes to be filed any Covered Claims for a period of one year. This Section 12.7 is inapplicable in California and in any other jurisdiction where this term is prohibited by law.
12.8. Severability
If any term or condition in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is determined to be unenforceable or in conflict with a mandatory provision of applicable law, it shall be construed to incorporate any mandatory provision, or the unenforceable or conflicting term or condition shall be automatically severed and the remainder of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall not be affected.
13. Right to Change/Modify/Cancel
Panda reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend, modify, limit, restrict and/or terminate the Program or any aspects or features of the Program at any time without prior notice to Members. Any changes Panda makes will be effective immediately on notice, which we may give either by posting the new terms on
www.PandaExpress.com

Diversity and Inclusion
Panda Restaurant Group, Inc., was built on a foundation of diversity, equity and inclusion. When first generation immigrants Andrew and Peggy Cherng opened the original Panda Inn in 1973, they did so with the commitment of achieving the American Dream for themselves and their extended family of Associates.
Today, our Company proudly employs associates in over 2,000 company-owned stores, and across several restaurant concepts, including Panda Express, Panda Inn, & Hibachi-San. We respect and appreciate our Associates’ varied journeys in life, including however they wish to identify, as well as their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and ideas. By embracing and uplifting our Associates at every level, we will not only meet their needs, but also the needs of our communities.
In 2013, we established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council and selected our first Chief Diversity Officer to continue elevating the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion in our business. The Council is comprised of Support Center and Operations ambassadors who are challenged to solicit feedback, share insights and champion actions that drive inclusion and engagement efforts reflecting the diversity of our guests, associates and communities.
At Panda Restaurant Group, Inc., we will achieve our vision of becoming a world leader in people development by fostering an environment of inclusion and belonging, creating a workplace where opportunity and growth are not only possible but achievable.
CA Supply Chain Act
CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAIN ACT OF 2010
Panda's standard agreement for its food sourcing suppliers does not require suppliers to comply with applicable labor laws, although Panda is considering doing this in 2012. Panda, however, conducts annual assessments of its food sourcing suppliers. In addition, Panda expects to expand this assessment to obtain additional information about these vendors' activities related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, including, where appropriate, preliminary risk assessment and supplier assessment questions, and later steps may take the form of requests for certification and/or audits. Panda primarily utilizes a third party for verification and audit processes. Panda also expects to evaluate whether supplemental training and/or changes in accountability standards and procedures for employees and/or contractors are appropriate.
Accessibility Statement
Panda Restaurant Group, Inc. is committed to providing excellent service to all of our guests, including those with disabilities.
To accomplish this, Panda Restaurant Group, Inc. has based its web accessibility standards on the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level A and AA success and conformance criteria. Here, at Panda Restaurant Group, Inc., we believe our continued efforts toward conforming to this standard will provide our guests with accessible content and an enjoyable experience.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
