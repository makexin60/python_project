Privacy Policy For Radiate
Last updated August 2020


  1. Overview

  We at Radiate The World, Inc. (“Radiate,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) have created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Radiate in connection with our online services, which are made available to you through a variety of platforms, including, but not limited to, www.radiatetheworld.com (the “Website”) and our Radiate app, which is accessible through a variety of connected devices, such as mobile devices (the “App”). The Website and the App are collectively referred to as the “Platform.”  The Privacy Policy applies to the Platform and any other websites or applications owned and operated by Radiate that direct the user to this Privacy Policy.

  This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information that we collect, how we use it, how and when it may be shared, and the rights and choices you have with respect to your information.  It also explains how we communicate with you and how you can make requests or submit inquiries to us about your information.  Our goal is to help you understand all of this, as part of our commitment to maintaining your trust.  We value and appreciate our users, you!

  2.     Changes to This Privacy Policy

  This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on the Platform.  We will notify you of any modifications to this Privacy Policy that might materially affect your rights or the way that we use or disclose your personal information prior to the change becoming effective by means of a message on the Platform. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of your personal information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the information. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.

  3.     Acceptance of Terms

  By visiting our Platform, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use,  including that the Radiate Platform may only be used by individuals 18 years old and above. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use. 

  If you do not agree with our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, please discontinue use of the Platform immediately.


  4.     Information We Collect or Receive


  As you use our Platform, Radiate collects certain information about you and your use of our Website and App.  This information falls into two primary categories:  (1) information you voluntarily provide us, and (2) information we collect from you automatically.

  (a)   Information You Voluntarily Provide Us

  Some personal information we collect is provided when you use our Platform, such as when you create a Radiate profile. This may include your name, mobile phone number, email address, country, and your username from third-party services such that may include Facebook, Instagram, Apple ID, or Gmail, if you choose to create an account with us using those services, or you otherwise wish to attach certain third-party service accounts to your Radiate profile. 

  For instance, you may register to use the Platform using your Facebook login. By doing so, you are authorizing Radiate to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy (and consistent with your privacy settings in Facebook), any and all information that you agreed that Facebook could provide to us through their application programming interface (“API”), including your Facebook username, unique Facebook identifier and access token, email address, gender, birthday, photos, personal description, and friends list.

  Additional information that you may voluntarily provide to us (either directly or via our social media pages), includes likes, interests, and other information that does not identify you personally.  Radiate does not receive any payment card information. 

  If you provide your permission, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our Platform, either directly or indirectly (e.g., by authorizing us to access the camera roll on your phone or other mobile device if you wish to add photos to your Radiate profile). This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number, as well as any user-generated content such as images and videos that you choose to share via the Platform.

  (b)  Information We Get When You Use Our Platform

  In addition to the personal information you voluntarily provide to us, we or service providers on our behalf may automatically collect or receive additional information regarding you and your use of our Platform, your interactions with us and our advertising, as well as information regarding your computer or other devices used to access our Platform (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include:

  i. From Your Activity

  Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which may consist of a static or dynamic IP address and will sometimes point to a specific identifiable computer or device;
  Browser type and language;
  Referring and exit pages and URLs;
  Date and time;
  Internet Service Provider; and
  Details regarding your activity on the Platform, such as search queries, pages visited, and other performance and usage data.
   

  To collect this information, we may use log files that record events in connection with your use of the Platform, as well as cookies and similar technologies, as described in this Privacy Policy.

  ii. About Your Device

  Type of device;
  Advertising Identifier (“IDFA” or “AAID” or “GAID”);
  Operating system and version (e.g., iOS, Android or Windows);
  Carrier;
  Geo-location; and
  Network type (WiFi, 3G, 4G, LTE).

  We also may collect certain information for debugging and testing purposes, and to prevent fraud and scammers, including your API level, device manufacturer, model number, Radiate app version, ID for vendor, and Firebase Cloud Messaging token.
   

  iii. Geolocational Information

   

  Certain features and functionalities of the Platform are based on your location, such as to show your approximate distance in relation to live/upcoming events or other Platform users. In order to provide these features and functionalities while you are using a mobile device, we may, with your permission, collect geolocational information from your mobile device or wireless carrier and/or certain third-party service providers. Such information is collectively called the “Geolocational Information.”

  Collection of such Geolocational Information occurs only when the Platform is running on your mobile device, and according to your mobile device’s settings.  From within our mobile application, you also have the ability to not allow Radiate to access your location, to allow location access only once, or to allow it while using the app.  Please note that if you decline to allow us to collect such Geolocational Information, we will not be able to provide certain features or functionalities to you.

  5.     How We Use Information

   

  We use your information for business and commercial purposes, including to create your Radiate user accounts, to provide the services and functionality you request, for security and fraud prevention, and to perform Platform analytics.

   
  We may use the information we collect or receive about you in a variety of ways, including to:

   
  (a)   To Provide Our Services.  We process certain personal information when you access or use our services, including to process your purchases of, or requests for, products and service (such as Radiate Glow); to register and verify user accounts; and to customize experiences.

  (b)  To Communicate With You.  We process certain information in order to communicate with you in relation to your accounts, our Platform, our marketing, and your requests, including to respond to your inquiries or requests for information; to communicate with you about orders, services and accounts; to administer our contests, sweepstakes, rewards, and other promotional programs; to solicit your feedback; and to provide notifications and important safety information.
   
  (c)   For Research, Development, and Improvement of Our Services.  We want to ensure that our Platform is continually improving and expanding so that we meet and exceed your needs and expectations.  To do so, we may process certain personal information, including to maintain, improve, and analyze our websites and mobile applications; for ad optimization; and to detect, prevent, or investigate suspicious activity or fraud.

  (d)  To Enforce Our Terms, Agreements, or Policies.  To maintain a safe, secure, and trusted environment for you when you use our Platform, we use your personal information to ensure our terms, policies, and agreements with you and any third parties are enforced.

  (e)   To Comply with Applicable Laws.  We may be required to process certain personal information under certain laws and regulations, including to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations and respond to lawful governmental requests, as required.

  (f)    With Your Consent.  We may process certain personal information in order to fulfill any other business or commercial purposes at your direction or with your consent.


  6.     How We Share Information
   

  We share your information as needed to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by applicable law.  This includes sharing with service providers to help perform business functions on our behalf, sharing with your consent, sharing for marketing purposes, sharing as part of corporate transactions, and sharing to protect lawful interests. 

  We may share your information in the following circumstances:

  (a)   When We Work Together Internally.  We may share some or all of your information with any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us, for purposes of management and analysis, decision making, and other business purposes, such as to process orders and requests, and to expand and promote our Platform offerings.

  (b)  As Part of Business Transactions.  As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the information may be part of the transferred assets.

  (c)   With Our Service Providers.  We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing technical assistance; hosting; customer service; marketing assistance; payment processing; performing analytics and determining lookalike audiences; facilitating debugging and security analysis; allowing users to talk and transmit video to each other; and administration of our rewards and promotional programs.

  These other companies will have access to your information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.  We strive to contractually prohibit these service providers from retaining, using, or disclosing your confidential personal information for any purpose other than performing agreed upon services for us.

  (d)  When You Post Information In Public Forums or on the Platform.  When you register as a user of the Platform, your Radiate profile will be viewable by other users of the Platform. Other users will be able to view information you have provided to us directly or through Facebook, such as your Facebook photos, any additional photos you upload, your first name, your age, the events you will or might be attending, your personal description, and information you have in common with the person viewing your profile, such as common Facebook friends and likes. If you swipe right to say “yes” to a person contacting you within the Platform, you will be able to chat with that person if they swipe right to you, e.g., when you have a “match.” If you chat with your match, of course, your match will see the content of your chat.

  In addition, please note that whenever you voluntarily disclose something, including personal information, on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.

  (e)   When Sharing Helps Us Protect Safety and Lawful Interests.  To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose the information: (i) when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing such information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Radiate or others, including you.

  (f)    When the Information Does Not Identify You.  In an ongoing effort to better understand our users, the Platform, and the products and services of Radiate and our promotional partners, we may analyze certain information in anonymized and aggregate form, such as an area’s overall traffic patterns, in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Platform and/or such products and services.

  This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share and/or license this aggregate data to our affiliates, agents, business and promotional partners, and other third parties. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe the Platform and these products and services to current and prospective business partners and investors and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

  (g)  Business Partners.  We may share Information with Event Producers or other Business Partners on limited occasions, such as if you have entered a ticket giveaway and we need to provide the organizer your contact information as a winner. However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of such sharing.

  (h)  When You Give Consent.  We may share personal information about you with other companies if you give us permission or direct us to share the information.

  7.     Our Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies


  Cookies and Browser Settings
   

  We and third parties on our behalf may use both session cookies, which expire once you close your web browser, and persistent cookies, which stay on your computer until you delete them and other technologies to help us collect data and to enhance your experience with the Platform. Cookies are small text files a website can use to recognize a repeat visitor to the website. We may use cookies and similar technologies for various purposes, including to:
   

  authenticate users;
  personalize your experience;
  understand browsing patterns and interactions, and engagement with emails we send;
  analyze which portions of the Platform are visited and used most frequently; and
  measure and optimize advertising and promotional effectiveness.
   

  If you do not want Radiate to deploy cookies in your browser, you can opt out by setting your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still use the Platform, although your ability to use some of the features may be affected.  If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser or review the instructions provided by the following browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari Desktop, Safari Mobile; and Android browser.


  Analytics
   

  We, the Platform, and our third-party technology providers use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to evaluate your use of the Platform, compile reports on activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to the Platform and mobile and Internet usage. These third parties use cookies and other technologies to help analyze and provide us the data. You consent to the processing of data by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

  For more information on how to opt-out Google Analytics tracking, click here.

  Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Advertising Companies

  We may share Other Information about you with third parties for ad distribution and ad optimization (defined as the tailoring, targeting (i.e., behavioral, contextual, and retargeting), analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing of ads). These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect Other Information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us and these third-party advertising companies to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site. In addition, we may receive Other Information from advertisers and/or their service providers such as advertising identifiers, IP addresses, and post-conversion data.


  8.     How to Opt Out of Third-Party Interest-Based Advertising
   

  Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where people can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each organization’s respective participating companies, visit the DAA’s opt-out portal available at http://optout.aboutads.info/, or visit the NAI’s opt-out portal available at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1.

  To opt-out of data collection for interest-based advertising across mobile applications by participating companies, download the DAA’s AppChoices mobile application opt-out offering here:  https://youradchoices.com/appchoices.

  Additionally, users of mobile devices can follow the below instructions:

  Android Users

  For Android devices, go to Settings > Google services > Ads > Turn on “Opt out of Ads Personalization."

  iOS Users

  For iOS devices, to limit interest-based ad tracking, go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Turn on “Limit Ad Tracking.”

  For iOS and Android, you can also reset the advertising identifier that is currently assigned to you.

  Do Not Track

  Please note that because no uniform standards for “Do Not Track” signals have been adopted, our Platform does not currently process or respond to DNT signals. Radiate reserves the right to update this in the future in light of technological updates surrounding DNT signals and web browser functionality.
   

  9.     How to Manage Your Information, Settings, and Communication Preferences


  If you have provided us any personal information, you may access, remove, review, and/or make changes to the same by contacting us as described in the “How To Contact Us” section below.  You also may make certain edits to your profile and settings from within your account on the Platform.

  In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Radiate marketing e-mail. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases. You cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to the Platform (e.g., requests for support).

  Please note that location services, push notifications, and access to your camera or photos may be adjusted or disabled within your device settings, or if you remove our mobile application from your device.  In addition, the Platform has built-in privacy controls as well, which we encourage you to explore and update regularly to match your privacy preferences.


  10.  How We Protect Your Information
   

  We take reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

  Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the databases of the third parties with which we may share such information, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to us may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail (and please do not send us sensitive information, such as payment card information or government-issued IDs).  You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and maintaining the security of your browsers and devices.
   

  11.  How We Retain Your Information
   

  We store personal information as needed to accomplish the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy and to meet legal requirements, including record retention, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
