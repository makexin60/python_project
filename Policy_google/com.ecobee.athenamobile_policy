1. Scope
This Privacy Notice describes and applies to personal information (as defined below) that we collect on or in connection with the ecobee Services and in texts, calls, emails, and other electronic communications sent through or in connection with the ecobee Services. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Notice or as required by applicable law, this Privacy Notice does not apply to information that is collected by any third-party, website, or app other than the ecobee Services. If you visit a third-party website or app that we mention or link to, be sure to review that party’s privacy policy, as that privacy policy will apply to your interactions with that website or app.
We also are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations or any other app developer, app provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with your use of the ecobee Services.
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Notice, "personal information" is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or otherwise could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you. "Personal information" does not include information which is generally not considered "personal information" under applicable law or is otherwise exempted under applicable law, such as information which is publicly available or subject to special data privacy laws and/or regulations, or information not otherwise considered "personal information" under applicable law.
2. Children’s Privacy
The ecobee Services are not directed to nor intended for use by children under 16 years old (a "Child" or "Children"). We do not knowingly collect personal information from Children. Children are not authorized to use the ecobee Services. If you are a Child, please do not use the ecobee Services or provide any personal information to, on, or through the ecobee Services. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a Child, we will delete that information.

3. Information We Collect and How We Collect Information
Below is a description of the types of information we may collect from you and how we collect that information. We may also describe how certain information is used or disclosed.
For certain ecobee Services, we need to collect personal information in order to provide the requested Services to you.  If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide the Services. If you disclose any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information as outlined in this Privacy Notice.
a. ecobee Website Visitors
Every computer connected to the Internet is provided with a domain name (e.g. someispname.net) and an IP Address (e.g. 192.164.13.145). When you visit a page on the ecobee Website, we automatically gather and log the following information, some of which may constitute personal information:
Your IP address;
The IP address of the website that may have referred you or that you may have linked to us from, if any;
The product identifier for version and make of your browser (e.g. Internet Explorer®);
The operating system platform that you may be running (e.g. Macintosh® or Windows®);
Search words or terms that are passed from a search engine (e.g. Google® or Yahoo!®); and
Information readily available and stored in your Adobe® Flash ‘System.Capabilities’ object.
We collect this information for two main purposes. First, ecobee has found it advantageous to examine visitor traffic in its aggregate, so that we can ensure maximum compatibility for visitors with various browsers and operating systems that visit the ecobee Website. Second, by analyzing visitor traffic and visitation patterns, referring URLs and search engine terms, we can strategically enhance internet presence.
To allow the ecobee Website to work properly and provide you with a personalized experience, we sometimes place cookies on your device.
You can choose whether to accept or reject cookies by changing the settings of your browser. Typically, by accessing the browser’s help feature, you can obtain information on how to prevent your browser from accepting all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience on the ecobee Website and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.
b. ecobee Web Store
If you purchase something, such as an ecobee Product or accessory direct from ecobee, we require the customary information to allow us to complete the purchase. Depending upon the method of payment and your location, the required information may include:
Name;
Billing address (for credit card orders);
Shipping address;
Email address;
Phone Number; and
Credit card information (for credit card orders).
This information will be processed by our online shopping cart provider and our third-party payment processor. We use shopping cart features that seek to safeguard this information.
If you purchase your ecobee Product as part of, or choose to participate in, an electricity usage or demand response program relating to grid stabilization or demand management, or an energy market program or environmental credit program (collectively, “Utility Programs”), your name, address, contact information, and other information relating to your purchase may be forwarded to your utility provider (“Utility”), Regional Transmission Organization, Independent System Operator, state agency, regulator, or third-party partners or implementors (with your Utility, individually or collectively, “Program Administrators”). Program Administrators may use your personal information for their own purposes, including in order to verify your eligibility in the Utility Program, installation details, and for any potential rebates or other participation rewards.
If you select an installation option as part of your purchase (available in certain areas only), your name, address, and contact information may be forwarded to ecobee’s installation partner to facilitate the installation of your purchased Product(s).
c. ecobee Product Users
In order to register your ecobee Product on the ecobee Website or ecobee App and create an ecobee account (“ecobee Account”), you will provide an email address to associate with your ecobee Account, and when you install your ecobee Product, you’ll be asked for personal information like your name, home address, ZIP code, utility name, utility account number, and utility rate structure (if provided), as well as home characteristics (age, number of floors, type of heating, etc.) (together with your email address, “ecobee Account Data”). Once your ecobee Account is active, you can remotely view and control your ecobee Product from the ecobee Website or ecobee App.
Your ecobee Product collects environmental data, such as temperature and humidity, as well as operational data, such as thermostat runtime data and temperature set points from your HVAC equipment. Some ecobee Product models may collect additional types of data, such as motion sensing (i.e., “occupancy sensing”). Depending on your ecobee Product model, your ecobee Product may also collect data from remote sensors in addition to the ecobee Product itself. Our ecobee Products, through machine learning with both on-device and remote processing, environmental sensors, operational HVAC information and usage data, and occupancy sensing data, seek to minimize energy usage when you are home or away. Collectively, this is known as “ecobee Product Data.” For ecobee Smart Security users, occupancy sensing data can be used to arm or disarm your home monitoring solution. To enable these remote functions, your ecobee Product transmits encrypted ecobee Product Data to the ecobee Website. The ecobee Product Data is stored on the ecobee Website to provide you with historical reports.
We use both ecobee Product Data and ecobee Account Data to enable you to make more intelligent decisions about how to manage your heating and cooling, and to reduce your energy bills. We may also aggregate your ecobee Product Data with ecobee Product Data from other homes in order to create reports and benchmarks and to allow you (and others) to compare energy usage, on a deidentified basis, with similar homes. ecobee may also send you information and reports regarding your ecobee Product’s operations, software updates, energy-savings opportunities, or promotions directly on the ecobee Website, through the ecobee App,or via email.
You can delete your ecobee account and associated ecobee Account Data, as well as ecobee Product Data, by deregistering your ecobee Product(s) using the ecobee Website or directly through the ecobee Product.
d. ecobee App users
In addition to the information we collect when you create an ecobee Account, when you use the ecobee App we may collect mobile device identifiers, app usage data, mobile device location, and Bluetooth data.
e. Mailing List and Social Communities
If you register for one of our mailing lists or online communities, we may use your email address to send you updates such as announcements, news, and information regarding new products or services. You have the option of unsubscribing at any time by clicking “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email from ecobee or by contacting us as provided in the How to Contact Us section below.
If you initiate specific communications to the ecobee staff through one of our social community sites, you will be required to provide specific information that will be routed to the appropriate contact within ecobee, who will respond to your communication.
f. eco+ and Utility Programs
eco+ works by monitoring your energy use, the usage rate structure of your Utility, and any Utility Programs. When you activate eco+, you will automatically be enrolled in demand response programs and events initiated by Program Administrators relating to grid stabilization or demand management (“Default Community Energy Savings Programs”). You may be eligible to participate in additional demand response programs offered by Program Administrators, which may require you to accept additional terms and conditions and may offer you incentives to enroll and participate in the program (“Additional Community Energy Savings Programs,” and together with Default Community Energy Savings Programs, “Community Energy Savings Programs”).
In order to operate and make eco+ available, including the Community Energy Savings Programs, ecobee collects certain information from you and discloses this information to Program Administrators who may use this information for their own purposes. ecobee Account Data and ecobee Product Data collected and disclosed by ecobee to your Program Administrators may include ecobee Account Data, ecobee Product Data, and your thermostat serial number, while personal information collected and disclosed by Program Administrators to ecobee may include your name, your address, your Utility account number, Utility account information, your utility meter ID, and utility meter data. Subject to any applicable law, your personal information may be used to assess your eligibility to participate in Utility Programs; verify your participation in Utility Programs; assist in decision making relating to energy production, grid stability, and conservation; and provide demand response, energy measurement, and verification services to Program Administrators or the applicable governing regulatory body. ecobee may also use the data disclosed to it by Program Administrators to improve the ecobee Services.
The Program Administrators may also use your ecobee Account Data, ecobee Product Data, and electricity use in order to make intelligent decisions relating to electricity production and conservation, and to provide Evaluation Measurement and Verification (“EM&V”) reports and services. Data contained in these EM&V reports and services may be disclosed to the appropriate utility system implementors and regulators as part of the Utility Program. ecobee may also use this data to improve its services, including the Utility Program. The Program Administrators may also deidentify and aggregate your data with data from other homes and use that data for their own purposes.
Note that ecobee may receive consideration from Program Administrators for successfully enrolling you in eco+ programs. More information can be found in ecobee’s Terms of Service available at
https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/privacy-policy/#Privacy-Policy-and-Legal
g. Voice Services
Certain ecobee Products are capable of being voice-controlled using certain third-party services when you link your third-party service to your ecobee Product (e.g., Alexa Voice Service (AVS) provided by Amazon Digital Services LLC (“Amazon”) or Siri provided by Apple, Inc.). When you enable voice-control on your ecobee Product, your ecobee Product continuously listens for “wake words.” When the ecobee Product hears one of these wake words, it will initiate a brief audio recording and transmit that recorded message to the third-party service for voice recognition processing. Use of third-party voice-control services governed by the third-party's respective terms of use. Any information you provide to the third-party via your ecobee Product will be treated in accordance with the third-party's privacy notice, not this Privacy Notice. ecobee does not have direct access to, or retain any copies of, your audio recordings. When your voice-control-enabled ecobee Product is in private mode, it is not listening for wake words, and no recorded messages are sent to the third-party service.
h. Video Services
ecobee SmartCameras and Smart Doorbell Cameras can stream and store recorded audio and video in the cloud. Video and audio recordings are processed directly on your SmartCamera and stored on the cloud for 30 days. All recordings and snapshots that are saved to the cloud are visible in the ecobee App, so you know exactly what clips have been sent and saved. When you delete a video from the ecobee App, it will also erase that video from the cloud. For ecobee Smart Security customers, your SmartCamera and Smart Doorbell Camera can also be used to determine occupancy in order to determine when to enable or disable your home monitoring system.
i. Product Subscriptions
We provide subscription services for some of our products, which allows you to receive these products on a regular schedule.
j. Other Third Parties
We partner with certain marketing and other third parties to assist us in providing the ecobee Services. For more information about the collection, use, transfer, and disclosure of your personal information and your available rights as it relates to these third parties, please visit the third party’s privacy policy.
4. Technician Installation
The technician that installs your ecobee Product may link their business contact information with your ecobee Product. The technician information, if entered, can be found in the "Main Menu > My ecobee Pro", on the thermostat itself. Through the web portal, it can be accessed electing "View full details > About > My Contractor  in the ecobee Website. From time to time, we may send maintenance reminders or promotional offers regarding your ecobee Product(s). Technicians that are linked to your thermostat will recieve alerts and reminders from the thermostat to allow them to better service your HVAC equipment.
Your ecobee Product may also forward operational and diagnostic information from compatible HVAC equipment (furnace, air conditioner, etc.) to the contractor web portal, if the communicating functionality is enabled. You can remove yourself from your technician’s list by selecting "Main Menu > My ecobee Pro > Remove ecobee Pro", and through the web portal, by selecting "View full details > About > My Contractor > Remove Contractor.
5. Third-Party Apps and Integration
ecobee Products are capable of communicating and integrating with a growing number of third-party devices, applications, and services, such as Apple HomeKit and IFTTT. If you enable integration with a third-party device, application, or service, you agree to disclose your ecobee Account Data and ecobee Product Data to that third party who may use this data for its own purposes. A different privacy policy will apply to your interactions with such device, application, or service.

www.ecobee.com
, including the ecobee web portal (the “ecobee Website”); or (iii) an ecobee mobile application that ecobee has made available for download via your smartphone or tablet device (the “ecobee App,” and together with the ecobee Products and ecobee Website, the “ecobee Services”). Certain ecobee Services may have additional terms and conditions which apply.
These TOS further govern your access to and use of ecobee’s eco+ service (“eco+,” and together with the other web-based or mobile device-based applications provided by ecobee, the “Remote Applications”), whether accessed via an ecobee Product, the ecobee Website, or the ecobee App. Use of eco+ is voluntary. You are under no obligation to use eco+ in order to use any ecobee Services.
You may contact ecobee by email at
legal@ecobee.com
with questions about these TOS.
PLEASE READ THESE ENTIRE TOS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE REMOTE APPLICATIONS.
THESE TOS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO YOU.
THESE TOS ARE A LEGAL AGREEMENT. BY ACCESSING AND USING THE REMOTE APPLICATIONS, YOU ARE ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO THESE TOS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACCESS. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND CAPACITY TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TOS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TOS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, THEN YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO ECOBEE THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON OR ENTITY TO THESE TOS. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF SUFFICIENT LEGAL AGE IN YOUR JURISDICTION OR RESIDENCE TO USE OR ACCESS THE REMOTE APPLCIATIONS AND TO ENTER INTO THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT. YOU FURTHER REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TOS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TOS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE REMOTE APPLICATIONS.
1. YOU MUST BE ELIGIBLE TO ENTER THESE TOS
The Remote Applications are offered and available to individuals who are 18 years of age or older and eligible to use the Remote Applications. By accessing or using the Remote Applications, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older and eligible to use the Remote Applications.
2. ecobee Account
In order to use the Remote Applications, you must have or set up an account with ecobee (“ecobee Account”).
ecobee reserves the right, in ecobee’s sole discretion, to reject any registration for an ecobee Account.
As part of the ecobee Account set-up process, you will be asked to provide certain personal information. ecobee will only use such personal information in accordance with the terms of Section 4 below.
If you choose to set-up an ecobee Account, then you agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information; (ii) maintain and promptly update the information you provide to ecobee; and (iii) not to provide any irrelevant data into any form or data entry field other than the data requested by ecobee for such field. In the event that you provide, or ecobee reasonably suspects that you have provided, any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, then ecobee has the right to suspend or terminate your ecobee Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Remote Applications.
Your ecobee Account username and password (“Login Methods”) are solely for your use or the use of the entity or person you represent. You are solely responsible for the confidentiality and security of your Login Methods. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your ecobee Account. ecobee is not obligated to inquire as to the authority or propriety of any use of, or action taken under, your Login Methods and/or ecobee Account.
3. Utility Account
eco+ works by monitoring your energy use, the usage rate structure of your utility provider and any Community Energy Savings Programs (as defined below) that your utility provider (“Utility”), Regional Transmission Organization, Independent System Operator, state agency, or third-party partners or implementors of such programs may issue (with your Utility, individually or collectively, “Program Administrators”).
In order to gain the full benefits of eco+, you must have an account with your Utility (“Utility Account”) or have the permission of the Utility Account owner to enter into these TOS. To achieve the full benefits of eco+, you also need to allow eco+ to connect to such Utility Account and share data with such Utility Account, as is described in Section 4 below.
In order to enable your use of eco+, you affirmatively direct ecobee to share your personal information with Program Administrators as necessary to implement the Community Energy Savings Programs. Additionally, you affirmatively consent to the release of your Utility Account data by your Utility to ecobee and other Program Administrators. In some jurisdictions, additional measures may be required by law or by your Utility in order for your Utility to recognize your consent to the release of your Utility Account data. You acknowledge that you understand that if you do not consent to the release of your Utility Account data by your Utility to ecobee and other Program Administrators, ecobee may be unable to provide certain eco+ features to you and you may not realize the full benefit of eco+.
You agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information regarding your Utility Account; (ii) maintain and promptly update the information you provide to ecobee; and (iii) not to provide any irrelevant data into any form or data entry field other than the data requested by ecobee for such field. In the event that you provide, or ecobee reasonably suspects that you have provided, any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, then ecobee has the right to suspend or terminate your use of eco+ and refuse any and all current or future use of eco+.
4. Privacy Policy and Data Sharing
ecobee is committed to protecting your privacy. Please review our Privacy Policy, located at ecobee.com/en-ca/privacy-policy, to understand how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information gathered by the Remote Applications.
In order to operate and make eco+ available, ecobee collects, and may disclose, your personal information to Program Administrators, and Program Administrators may disclose your personal information to us. Under ecobee’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these TOS by reference, eco+ is defined as a “Utility Program.” Utility Programs may include both Community Energy Savings Programs and other energy efficiency programs. Your privacy is important to ecobee, and ecobee’s Privacy Policy explains how ecobee collects, uses, discloses, and protects your personal information. Subject to any applicable law, your personal information may be used to assess your eligibility to participate in Utility Programs; verify your participation in Utility Programs; assist in decision making relating to energy production, grid stability, and conservation; and provide demand response, energy measurement, and verification services to a Program Administrator or its governing regulatory body. ecobee may also use the information to improve the ecobee Services and Remote Applications.
Disabling eco+ will revoke your consent and terminate ecobee’s ability to share further personal information with Program Administrators.
5. Community Energy Savings Programs
When you activate eco+,  you will automatically be enrolled in demand response programs and events initiated by Program Administrators relating to grid stabilization or demand management (“Default Community Energy Savings Programs”). These programs reduce energy consumption and load on the grid, reducing costs and the risks of brownouts and blackouts. You can opt out of participation in any and all Default Community Energy Savings Programs and their events at any time by deactivating the Default Community Energy Savings Program in the ecobee App, by contacting ecobee Customer Service at 1-877-932-6233, or by indefinitely deactivating eco+ within the ecobee App in the eco+ menu.
You may be eligible to participate in additional demand response programs offered by Program Administrators, which may require you to accept additional terms and conditions and may offer you incentives for enrolling and participating in the program (“Additional Community Energy Savings Programs,” and together with Default Community Energy Savings Programs, “Community Energy Savings Programs”). In such cases, eco+ will seek to notify you of these third-party terms and conditions and allow you to opt into such Additional Community Energy Savings Programs. If you enroll into an Additional Community Energy Savings Program, you may receive notice of Additional Community Energy Savings Program events which will appear on your ecobee Product and ecobee App. Note that if you opt in and enroll in an Additional Community Energy Savings Program, you will automatically be unenrolled from any Default Community Energy Savings Program. You can opt out of any in progress Additional Community Energy Savings Program event at any time, notwithstanding any clauses to the contrary set forth in your Utility’s terms and conditions, by deactivating the Additional Community Energy Savings Program in the ecobee App and submitting a request to the Program Administrator to unenroll.
ecobee does not determine customer eligibility for Community Energy Savings Programs. Those determinations are made solely by Program Administrators and are outside of ecobee’s control.
6. Specific Acknowledgements by You
You acknowledge and agree that:
a. ecobee may manage and control your ecobee Product(s) in order to provide eco+ and in order for you to participate in Community Energy Savings Programs;
b. If you do not opt out of the Default Community Energy Savings Program, ecobee may manage and control your ecobee Products during periods of peak energy demand for the grid, which may or may not coincide with peak electricity price periods;
c. ecobee may manage and control your ecobee Product(s) in order to provide additional energy savings when it provides value to Program Administrators or the electricity grid, such as during periods of high electricity demand;
d. You authorize and direct ecobee to share your personal information with Program Administrators to the extent necessary in order to provide the eco+ service and facilitate the Community Energy Savings Programs;
e. The Program Administrator may issue requests for reducing your energy consumption during Community Energy Savings Programs events, such as during peak electricity price periods. During these Community Energy Savings Program events, ecobee may change your temperature set point (for Default Community Energy Savings Programs) or turn off your ecobee Product(s) (for Additional Community Energy Savings Programs). However, you can always override ecobee’s control of your ecobee Product(s) and manually control your affected ecobee Product(s);
f. The Program Administrator may offer programs and offer incentives for you to participate in Additional Community Energy Savings Programs. In some cases, you may need to accept additional terms in order to participate in one of these Additional Community Energy Savings Programs. Participation in an Additional Community Energy Savings Program is optional. ecobee will communicate with you the details of the Additional Community Energy Savings Program, including how to participate or opt out. However, ecobee is not responsible for any failure on the part of the Program Administrator to provide any incentives to you;
g. ecobee may receive consideration from the Program Administrator for successfully enrolling you in eco+ programs
1
. So long as it does not conflict with any incentives provided to you under S.6(f)., ecobee shall be eligible to claim any qualifying environmental attributes, benefits, credits, awards or bounties from Program Administrators resulting from savings gained by the benefit of eco+, which forfeits any option you might have to enroll in the programs directly or rights to environmental attributes related to eco+;
h. ecobee may communicate with you via email with respect to the ecobee Products and Services and Remote Applications. For example, by registering your device and providing an email address during the account creation process, ecobee may from time to time send you HVAC alerts and reminders, notices about software updates, energy savings advice, news about ecobee Services, customer feedback or surveys, as well as marketing materials related to ecobee and other third-party product offerings. These electronic communications may be sent through email, the ecobee Website, the ecobee App, or other communication channels as deemed relevant by ecobee. You may unsubscribe from these emails at any time;
i. Without limiting the disclaimers in Section 9, ecobee makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees regarding any results of or performance of eco+, including that eco+ will achieve any energy saving or other benefits for you. Although unlikely, in rare circumstances, eco+ could potentially result in increased costs.

In order to register your ecobee Product on the ecobee Website or ecobee App and create an ecobee account (“ecobee Account”), you will provide an email address to associate with your ecobee Account, and when you install your ecobee Product, you’ll be asked for personal information like your name, home address, ZIP code, utility name, utility account number, and utility rate structure (if provided), as well as home characteristics (age, number of floors, type of heating, etc.) (together with your email address, “ecobee Account Data”). Once your ecobee Account is active, you can remotely view and control your ecobee Product from the ecobee Website or ecobee App.
Your ecobee Product collects environmental data, such as temperature and humidity, as well as operational data, such as thermostat runtime data and temperature set points from your HVAC equipment. Some ecobee Product models may collect additional types of data, such as motion sensing (i.e., “occupancy sensing”). Depending on your ecobee Product model, your ecobee Product may also collect data from remote sensors in addition to the ecobee Product itself. Our ecobee Products, through machine learning with both on-device and remote processing, environmental sensors, operational HVAC information and usage data, and occupancy sensing data, seek to minimize energy usage when you are home or away. Collectively, this is known as “ecobee Product Data.” For ecobee Smart Security users, occupancy sensing data can be used to arm or disarm your home monitoring solution. To enable these remote functions, your ecobee Product transmits encrypted ecobee Product Data to the ecobee Website. The ecobee Product Data is stored on the ecobee Website to provide you with historical reports.
We use both ecobee Product Data and ecobee Account Data to enable you to make more intelligent decisions about how to manage your heating and cooling, and to reduce your energy bills. We may also aggregate your ecobee Product Data with ecobee Product Data from other homes in order to create reports and benchmarks and to allow you (and others) to compare energy usage, on a deidentified basis, with similar homes. ecobee may also send you information and reports regarding your ecobee Product’s operations, software updates, energy-savings opportunities, or promotions directly on the ecobee Website, through the ecobee App,or via email.
You can delete your ecobee account and associated ecobee Account Data, as well as ecobee Product Data, by deregistering your ecobee Product(s) using the ecobee Website or directly through the ecobee Product.
d. ecobee App users
In addition to the information we collect when you create an ecobee Account, when you use the ecobee App we may collect mobile device identifiers, app usage data, mobile device location, and Bluetooth data.
e. Mailing List and Social Communities
If you register for one of our mailing lists or online communities, we may use your email address to send you updates such as announcements, news, and information regarding new products or services. You have the option of unsubscribing at any time by clicking “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email from ecobee or by contacting us as provided in the How to Contact Us section below.
If you initiate specific communications to the ecobee staff through one of our social community sites, you will be required to provide specific information that will be routed to the appropriate contact within ecobee, who will respond to your communication.
f. eco+ and Utility Programs
eco+ works by monitoring your energy use, the usage rate structure of your Utility, and any Utility Programs. When you activate eco+, you will automatically be enrolled in demand response programs and events initiated by Program Administrators relating to grid stabilization or demand management (“Default Community Energy Savings Programs”). You may be eligible to participate in additional demand response programs offered by Program Administrators, which may require you to accept additional terms and conditions and may offer you incentives to enroll and participate in the program (“Additional Community Energy Savings Programs,” and together with Default Community Energy Savings Programs, “Community Energy Savings Programs”).
In order to operate and make eco+ available, including the Community Energy Savings Programs, ecobee collects certain information from you and discloses this information to Program Administrators who may use this information for their own purposes. ecobee Account Data and ecobee Product Data collected and disclosed by ecobee to your Program Administrators may include ecobee Account Data, ecobee Product Data, and your thermostat serial number, while personal information collected and disclosed by Program Administrators to ecobee may include your name, your address, your Utility account number, Utility account information, your utility meter ID, and utility meter data. Subject to any applicable law, your personal information may be used to assess your eligibility to participate in Utility Programs; verify your participation in Utility Programs; assist in decision making relating to energy production, grid stability, and conservation; and provide demand response, energy measurement, and verification services to Program Administrators or the applicable governing regulatory body. ecobee may also use the data disclosed to it by Program Administrators to improve the ecobee Services.
The Program Administrators may also use your ecobee Account Data, ecobee Product Data, and electricity use in order to make intelligent decisions relating to electricity production and conservation, and to provide Evaluation Measurement and Verification (“EM&V”) reports and services. Data contained in these EM&V reports and services may be disclosed to the appropriate utility system implementors and regulators as part of the Utility Program. ecobee may also use this data to improve its services, including the Utility Program. The Program Administrators may also deidentify and aggregate your data with data from other homes and use that data for their own purposes.
Note that ecobee may receive consideration from Program Administrators for successfully enrolling you in eco+ programs. More information can be found in ecobee’s Terms of Service available at
https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/privacy-policy/#Privacy-Policy-and-Legal
g. Voice Services
Certain ecobee Products are capable of being voice-controlled using certain third-party services when you link your third-party service to your ecobee Product (e.g., Alexa Voice Service (AVS) provided by Amazon Digital Services LLC (“Amazon”) or Siri provided by Apple, Inc.). When you enable voice-control on your ecobee Product, your ecobee Product continuously listens for “wake words.” When the ecobee Product hears one of these wake words, it will initiate a brief audio recording and transmit that recorded message to the third-party service for voice recognition processing. Use of third-party voice-control services governed by the third-party's respective terms of use. Any information you provide to the third-party via your ecobee Product will be treated in accordance with the third-party's privacy notice, not this Privacy Notice. ecobee does not have direct access to, or retain any copies of, your audio recordings. When your voice-control-enabled ecobee Product is in private mode, it is not listening for wake words, and no recorded messages are sent to the third-party service.
h. Video Services
ecobee SmartCameras and Smart Doorbell Cameras can stream and store recorded audio and video in the cloud. Video and audio recordings are processed directly on your SmartCamera and stored on the cloud for 30 days. All recordings and snapshots that are saved to the cloud are visible in the ecobee App, so you know exactly what clips have been sent and saved. When you delete a video from the ecobee App, it will also erase that video from the cloud. For ecobee Smart Security customers, your SmartCamera and Smart Doorbell Camera can also be used to determine occupancy in order to determine when to enable or disable your home monitoring system.
i. Product Subscriptions
We provide subscription services for some of our products, which allows you to receive these products on a regular schedule.
j. Other Third Parties
We partner with certain marketing and other third parties to assist us in providing the ecobee Services. For more information about the collection, use, transfer, and disclosure of your personal information and your available rights as it relates to these third parties, please visit the third party’s privacy policy.
4. Technician Installation
The technician that installs your ecobee Product may link their business contact information with your ecobee Product. The technician information, if entered, can be found in the "Main Menu > My ecobee Pro", on the thermostat itself. Through the web portal, it can be accessed electing "View full details > About > My Contractor  in the ecobee Website. From time to time, we may send maintenance reminders or promotional offers regarding your ecobee Product(s). Technicians that are linked to your thermostat will recieve alerts and reminders from the thermostat to allow them to better service your HVAC equipment.
Your ecobee Product may also forward operational and diagnostic information from compatible HVAC equipment (furnace, air conditioner, etc.) to the contractor web portal, if the communicating functionality is enabled. You can remove yourself from your technician’s list by selecting "Main Menu > My ecobee Pro > Remove ecobee Pro", and through the web portal, by selecting "View full details > About > My Contractor > Remove Contractor.

2. ecobee Account
In order to use the Remote Applications, you must have or set up an account with ecobee (“ecobee Account”).
ecobee reserves the right, in ecobee’s sole discretion, to reject any registration for an ecobee Account.
As part of the ecobee Account set-up process, you will be asked to provide certain personal information. ecobee will only use such personal information in accordance with the terms of Section 4 below.
If you choose to set-up an ecobee Account, then you agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information; (ii) maintain and promptly update the information you provide to ecobee; and (iii) not to provide any irrelevant data into any form or data entry field other than the data requested by ecobee for such field. In the event that you provide, or ecobee reasonably suspects that you have provided, any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, then ecobee has the right to suspend or terminate your ecobee Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Remote Applications.
Your ecobee Account username and password (“Login Methods”) are solely for your use or the use of the entity or person you represent. You are solely responsible for the confidentiality and security of your Login Methods. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your ecobee Account. ecobee is not obligated to inquire as to the authority or propriety of any use of, or action taken under, your Login Methods and/or ecobee Account.
3. Utility Account
eco+ works by monitoring your energy use, the usage rate structure of your utility provider and any Community Energy Savings Programs (as defined below) that your utility provider (“Utility”), Regional Transmission Organization, Independent System Operator, state agency, or third-party partners or implementors of such programs may issue (with your Utility, individually or collectively, “Program Administrators”).
In order to gain the full benefits of eco+, you must have an account with your Utility (“Utility Account”) or have the permission of the Utility Account owner to enter into these TOS. To achieve the full benefits of eco+, you also need to allow eco+ to connect to such Utility Account and share data with such Utility Account, as is described in Section 4 below.
In order to enable your use of eco+, you affirmatively direct ecobee to share your personal information with Program Administrators as necessary to implement the Community Energy Savings Programs. Additionally, you affirmatively consent to the release of your Utility Account data by your Utility to ecobee and other Program Administrators. In some jurisdictions, additional measures may be required by law or by your Utility in order for your Utility to recognize your consent to the release of your Utility Account data. You acknowledge that you understand that if you do not consent to the release of your Utility Account data by your Utility to ecobee and other Program Administrators, ecobee may be unable to provide certain eco+ features to you and you may not realize the full benefit of eco+.
You agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information regarding your Utility Account; (ii) maintain and promptly update the information you provide to ecobee; and (iii) not to provide any irrelevant data into any form or data entry field other than the data requested by ecobee for such field. In the event that you provide, or ecobee reasonably suspects that you have provided, any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, then ecobee has the right to suspend or terminate your use of eco+ and refuse any and all current or future use of eco+.
4. Privacy Policy and Data Sharing
ecobee is committed to protecting your privacy. Please review our Privacy Policy, located at ecobee.com/en-ca/privacy-policy, to understand how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information gathered by the Remote Applications.
In order to operate and make eco+ available, ecobee collects, and may disclose, your personal information to Program Administrators, and Program Administrators may disclose your personal information to us. Under ecobee’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these TOS by reference, eco+ is defined as a “Utility Program.” Utility Programs may include both Community Energy Savings Programs and other energy efficiency programs. Your privacy is important to ecobee, and ecobee’s Privacy Policy explains how ecobee collects, uses, discloses, and protects your personal information. Subject to any applicable law, your personal information may be used to assess your eligibility to participate in Utility Programs; verify your participation in Utility Programs; assist in decision making relating to energy production, grid stability, and conservation; and provide demand response, energy measurement, and verification services to a Program Administrator or its governing regulatory body. ecobee may also use the information to improve the ecobee Services and Remote Applications.
Disabling eco+ will revoke your consent and terminate ecobee’s ability to share further personal information with Program Administrators.
5. Community Energy Savings Programs
When you activate eco+,  you will automatically be enrolled in demand response programs and events initiated by Program Administrators relating to grid stabilization or demand management (“Default Community Energy Savings Programs”). These programs reduce energy consumption and load on the grid, reducing costs and the risks of brownouts and blackouts. You can opt out of participation in any and all Default Community Energy Savings Programs and their events at any time by deactivating the Default Community Energy Savings Program in the ecobee App, by contacting ecobee Customer Service at 1-877-932-6233, or by indefinitely deactivating eco+ within the ecobee App in the eco+ menu.
You may be eligible to participate in additional demand response programs offered by Program Administrators, which may require you to accept additional terms and conditions and may offer you incentives for enrolling and participating in the program (“Additional Community Energy Savings Programs,” and together with Default Community Energy Savings Programs, “Community Energy Savings Programs”). In such cases, eco+ will seek to notify you of these third-party terms and conditions and allow you to opt into such Additional Community Energy Savings Programs. If you enroll into an Additional Community Energy Savings Program, you may receive notice of Additional Community Energy Savings Program events which will appear on your ecobee Product and ecobee App. Note that if you opt in and enroll in an Additional Community Energy Savings Program, you will automatically be unenrolled from any Default Community Energy Savings Program. You can opt out of any in progress Additional Community Energy Savings Program event at any time, notwithstanding any clauses to the contrary set forth in your Utility’s terms and conditions, by deactivating the Additional Community Energy Savings Program in the ecobee App and submitting a request to the Program Administrator to unenroll.
ecobee does not determine customer eligibility for Community Energy Savings Programs. Those determinations are made solely by Program Administrators and are outside of ecobee’s control.
6. Specific Acknowledgements by You
You acknowledge and agree that:
a. ecobee may manage and control your ecobee Product(s) in order to provide eco+ and in order for you to participate in Community Energy Savings Programs;
b. If you do not opt out of the Default Community Energy Savings Program, ecobee may manage and control your ecobee Products during periods of peak energy demand for the grid, which may or may not coincide with peak electricity price periods;
c. ecobee may manage and control your ecobee Product(s) in order to provide additional energy savings when it provides value to Program Administrators or the electricity grid, such as during periods of high electricity demand;
d. You authorize and direct ecobee to share your personal information with Program Administrators to the extent necessary in order to provide the eco+ service and facilitate the Community Energy Savings Programs;
e. The Program Administrator may issue requests for reducing your energy consumption during Community Energy Savings Programs events, such as during peak electricity price periods. During these Community Energy Savings Program events, ecobee may change your temperature set point (for Default Community Energy Savings Programs) or turn off your ecobee Product(s) (for Additional Community Energy Savings Programs). However, you can always override ecobee’s control of your ecobee Product(s) and manually control your affected ecobee Product(s);
f. The Program Administrator may offer programs and offer incentives for you to participate in Additional Community Energy Savings Programs. In some cases, you may need to accept additional terms in order to participate in one of these Additional Community Energy Savings Programs. Participation in an Additional Community Energy Savings Program is optional. ecobee will communicate with you the details of the Additional Community Energy Savings Program, including how to participate or opt out. However, ecobee is not responsible for any failure on the part of the Program Administrator to provide any incentives to you;
g. ecobee may receive consideration from the Program Administrator for successfully enrolling you in eco+ programs
1
. So long as it does not conflict with any incentives provided to you under S.6(f)., ecobee shall be eligible to claim any qualifying environmental attributes, benefits, credits, awards or bounties from Program Administrators resulting from savings gained by the benefit of eco+, which forfeits any option you might have to enroll in the programs directly or rights to environmental attributes related to eco+;
h. ecobee may communicate with you via email with respect to the ecobee Products and Services and Remote Applications. For example, by registering your device and providing an email address during the account creation process, ecobee may from time to time send you HVAC alerts and reminders, notices about software updates, energy savings advice, news about ecobee Services, customer feedback or surveys, as well as marketing materials related to ecobee and other third-party product offerings. These electronic communications may be sent through email, the ecobee Website, the ecobee App, or other communication channels as deemed relevant by ecobee. You may unsubscribe from these emails at any time;
i. Without limiting the disclaimers in Section 9, ecobee makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees regarding any results of or performance of eco+, including that eco+ will achieve any energy saving or other benefits for you. Although unlikely, in rare circumstances, eco+ could potentially result in increased costs.
