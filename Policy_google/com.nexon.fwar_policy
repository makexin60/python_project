Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates and is not saved on your computer disk drive.

VALOFE does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required.
5. Your Rights and Choices
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to VALOFE. The notice we intend to provide where we collect Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of our web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
5.1. RIGHT OF ACCESS
You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Services regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc.
5.2. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION
You control which ID, email, country, social networks accounts, and trusted sites we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate.
5.3. RIGHT TO ERASURE
You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the account management section in our homepage. In the event a user requests the deletion of personal information, it will be conducted under the supervision of the 'Data Protection Officer'. In case of possession of SNS Account, you have the right to obtain deletion via 'Account Deletion' available in game.
As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Services, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to VALOFE forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for including but not limited to, all of your game related items, characters, and all remaining game credits on your account.
Important note: Any Virtual Goods you purchase from us are directly linked to the existence of your Account. If you decide to close your Account, you will lose any Virtual Goods accessible from that Account at the time of the termination and you will not be entitled to any refunds or compensation.
Grace period. We will allow you to restore your Account during a minimum grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request.
Complicated Account deletion. In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended.
Information we retain. Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all Personal Data about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game. We will retain anonymous information after your Account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g. through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
5.4. RIGHT TO OBJECT
Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 21 of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

For example, you interact with a Third Party Service when you “like” or “share” content over social media through our Services or login to our Services through a Third Party Service. Remember that third parties may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit personal information from you. If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature. Also, if you make information public through our Services or a Third Party Service that references our Services, such as by tweeting or updating your status along with a hashtag associated with VALOFE, that information may be used on or in connection with our Services.

Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Services and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Services (“Interest-based Advertising”).
The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Services, a Third Party Service, or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S., South Korea, or elsewhere.

Except as may be required by law, VALOFE will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13. We take the privacy of children very seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. For residents of the EEA, where processing of personal information is based on consent, VALOFE will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law. If we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.
Parents and guardians should regularly oversee their children's use of email and other online communications and transactional features. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers that can help provide a safe online environment for kids. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us please contact us at support@valofe.com
9. Use and Share of Personal Information
We will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests according to Article 6 of the GDPR to notify you and provide you with information about features on our Sites, new product releases and service developments and to advertise our products and services in accordance with this Policy. Namely, once you have created an Account we may use your email address, nickname, IP address, mobile phone number, in order to send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Games. Also, if you opt-in, we will send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about VALOFE offline events, co-projects of VALOFE and its partners, as well as about VALOFE games, not using VALOFE ID. You can opt-in while creating your Account or later through our account management, while you are also free to opt-out from various subscriptions through this tool. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from all our emails, messages, in-game and web-offers, we may still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as “transactional”), e.g. to confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted.
We use your Personal Information to provide you with contents and services that are tailored specifically to the profile you provide. In connection with the delivery of our services, we may share the personal information with third-party partners or vendors who help deliver or administer the services, but they are only permitted to use the information in connection with the delivery or administration of our services.

5. Your Rights and Choices
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to VALOFE. The notice we intend to provide where we collect Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice.

5.1. RIGHT OF ACCESS
You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Services regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc.
5.2. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION
You control which ID, email, country, social networks accounts, and trusted sites we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate.

You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the account management section in our homepage. In the event a user requests the deletion of personal information, it will be conducted under the supervision of the 'Data Protection Officer'. In case of possession of SNS Account, you have the right to obtain deletion via 'Account Deletion' available in game.

Important note: Any Virtual Goods you purchase from us are directly linked to the existence of your Account. If you decide to close your Account, you will lose any Virtual Goods accessible from that Account at the time of the termination and you will not be entitled to any refunds or compensation.
Grace period. We will allow you to restore your Account during a minimum grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request.
Complicated Account deletion. In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended.
Information we retain. Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all Personal Data about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game. We will retain anonymous information after your Account has been closed.

Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
5.4. RIGHT TO OBJECT
Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 21 of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time.

4. Notice
Where VALOFE collects Personal Information on the web, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether we plan to share such Personal Information outside of VALOFE or those working on our behalf. VALOFE does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required.
5. Your Rights and Choices
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to VALOFE. The notice we intend to provide where we collect Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of our web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
5.1. RIGHT OF ACCESS
You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Services regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc.
5.2. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION
You control which ID, email, country, social networks accounts, and trusted sites we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate.
5.3. RIGHT TO ERASURE
You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the account management section in our homepage. In the event a user requests the deletion of personal information, it will be conducted under the supervision of the 'Data Protection Officer'. In case of possession of SNS Account, you have the right to obtain deletion via "Account Deletion" available in game.
As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Services, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to VALOFE forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for including but not limited to, all of your game related items, characters, and all remaining game credits on your account.
Important note: Any Virtual Goods you purchase from us are directly linked to the existence of your Account. If you decide to close your Account, you will lose any Virtual Goods accessible from that Account at the time of the termination and you will not be entitled to any refunds or compensation.
Grace period. We will allow you to restore your Account during a minimum grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request.
Complicated Account deletion. In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended.
Information we retain. Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all Personal Data about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game. We will retain anonymous information after your Account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g. through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
5.4. RIGHT TO OBJECT
Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 21 of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

For example, you interact with a Third Party Service when you “like” or “share” content over social media through our Services or login to our Services through a Third Party Service. Remember that third parties may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit personal information from you. If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature. Also, if you make information public through our Services or a Third Party Service that references our Services, such as by tweeting or updating your status along with a hashtag associated with VALOFE, that information may be used on or in connection with our Services.
Our Services also contain Tracking Technologies operated by third parties. For example, analytics services, such as Google Analytics, may use Tracking Technologies on our Services to help us analyze your use of the Services, compile statistic reports on the Services’ activity, and provide other services relating to Services activity and Internet usage. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Services and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Services (“Interest-based Advertising”).
The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Services, a Third Party Service, or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S., South Korea, or elsewhere.

Except as may be required by law, VALOFE will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13. We take the privacy of children very seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. For residents of the EEA, where processing of personal information is based on consent, VALOFE will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law. If we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.
Parents and guardians should regularly oversee their children's use of email and other online communications and transactional features. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers that can help provide a safe online environment for kids. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us please contact us at support@valofe.com

You can opt-in while creating your Account or later through our account management, while you are also free to opt-out from various subscriptions through this tool.

We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted.
We use your Personal Information to provide you with contents and services that are tailored specifically to the profile you provide.
