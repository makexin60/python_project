This Privacy Statement applies to your interaction with Lowe’s as a prospective, current or former Lowe’s customer, visitor or business partner. It describes how Lowe’s collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information from and about you, along with choices you can make about such information. This Privacy Statement is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations.
We collect the following categories of personal information in order to provide products and services to you, to communicate with you, to enhance our products, services, and operations, and for other operational, legal, and compliance purposes:
Identification information
that can be used to identify you, such as your name, alias, address, phone number, email address, payment information, login and access credentials, signatures, or other identifiers. We may also collect online identifiers, such as your IP address, when you browse our websites or use our applications.
Commercial information,
such as products or services you purchased or considered purchasing, information about your participation in contests, sweepstakes, or promotions.
Online activities information,
such as browsing history, search history, and other information when you interact with our websites, applications, and advertisements, such as keystroke activity.
Geolocation data,
including precise geolocation data if you allow our application to collect it for purposes such as helping you locate the nearest Lowe’s store or alerting our stores when you are on the way to pick up your orders, in connection with specific services we may offer (such as store map), or for analytic purposes.
Audio, electronic, video or image information,
such as audio or video recording when you visit our stores, parking lot, or interact with us by phone or virtually. Photos taken when we are working on your project to document progress or completion. When legally permitted, after detecting a security incident for investigation and prosecution purposes, we may use image scan technology on images we previously captured to identify any suspected individual(s). Our cameras may capture license plate information when permitted in certain states.
Professional or employment-related information,
such as information about you as representatives of our customers and business partners, in connection with our services and the operation of our business, including business contact information, job title, company name, and office visitor access information, where applicable.
Protected class information under state or federal laws,
such as age, gender, and family status.
Education information,
such as when you respond to a customer survey.
Inferences or preferences
we learn or infer about you.
Sensitive Personal Information,
such as precise geolocation, race and ethnicity information, government ID, and payment card information when permitted by law. For instance, with your consent, we use precise geolocation to calculate your arrival time for in-store product pickup, so the products are ready for you upon your arrival. We may collect government-issued ID for certain types of transactions such as returns without receipts.
Other personal information,
if it identifies, relates and can be reasonably associated with or linked to you (or your household), such as photos you upload, or measurement data or floorplan data generated when using Lowe’s measurement services or through measurement technologies, such as the Lowe’s Measure Your Space or floor/kitchen visualization features.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal information so that it is non-personal information, such as aggregating (combining it with data about other individuals) and/or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as “hashing,” or otherwise removing characteristics that make the data personally identifiable to you. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal information to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. If we combine non-personal information with personal information, then we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Statement.
We do not knowingly collect or disclose personal information from children under the age of 16 without parental or guardian consent.
If a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us so that the information can be deleted.

You can learn more about and set up GPC here: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about and set up Do Not Track here: http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Information Collected in the Programs.

online activities and commercial information

How We Share Information

For instance, when necessary, we disclose your information to service providers for purposes including installation, repair, warranty, order processing and fulfillment, information technology, marketing, customer service, data analytics, research and enhancement, fraud prevention, product recall, and legal, compliance and risk management.

Impact of Deletion on MyLowe’s Rewards or MyLowe’s Pro Rewards Account.
Our programs are based on points which accrue to your unique membership identification number based on your purchases. Without the ability to relate and track your transactions to the membership identification number that will be deleted as a result of your deletion request, we will be unable to provide you with access to your member-only benefits that we may offer from time to time. Additionally, we will be unable to recover your account after deletion.
If you choose to exercise your data privacy rights such that your Rewards Program is impacted, we will notify you the consequences of your decision prior to discontinuing your membership or benefits.
The financial incentives we offer to customers are reasonably related to the value of the customer’s data to our business, based on our reasonable but sole determination. We estimate the value of customers’ personal information by considering the expenses incurred by the business related to the collection, storage and retention of personal information in the context of the program and the expenses related to the provision of the program. The value to our business of any individual customer’s personal information is based on specific facts such as whether and to what extent you take advantage of any offerings and whether and to what extent you opt out of any offerings. We do not calculate the value of customer data in our accounting statements. From time to time, we may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive program, which will be presented to you at the time you sign up for the program.
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed and intended to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Despite these safeguards, due to inherent uncertainty in the use of the internet and information systems and the potential for unlawful attacks by third parties, we cannot guarantee that the use of our systems, websites or applications will be completely safe or secure.
We retain personal information only for as long as is
reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, comply
with our legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. To
determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we
consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the
potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal
information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our
legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.
Once retention of the personal
information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will
either delete or deidentify the personal information or, if this is not

Cookies and Other Technologies
Cookies refer to small packets of data that websites send to your computer or other internet-connected devices. Lowe’s and our business partners use them for different purposes. These technologies can uniquely identify your browser and log information, such as your device type, system and browser information, IP address, system language, location and your interactions with the site. Like other websites, we need some essential cookies for our website to function properly. We also use some functional cookies to pre-populate your log-in ID to make it easier for you, or to help us remember where you left off when you shopped, so you do not have to restart all over again. We may use browser cookies, flash cookies and other types of local storage.
We, and our third-party partners may record your keystroke activity and rhythms, mouse movements, scrolling and clicks when you use our websites or mobile applications for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve our products and services, and to address functionality issues.
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect data about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third-party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with our services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from our services.
We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) to collect data through mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network data, and website usage behavior. SDKs are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps including those that collect data from your device.
Lowe’s and our business partners also use cookies with other technologies, such as web tags, beacons or pixels. They allow us to count visitors to our webpages, evaluate the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or recommend relevant products and services to you when you browse social media or other websites. We think these technologies create meaningful interactions with you and are helpful, but you can let us know that you prefer otherwise by opting out from these advertising cookies and technologies by clicking below. You can find more information and options in
Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising
section. We may also use third-party web analytics services in our online services to help us analyze how users use our online services.
Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising
We collect data about your activities on our websites and applications for use in providing tailored advertising, and we may share information about activities on our websites with advertising networks administered by third parties. These ad networks track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. As a result, you may see certain ads on other websites based on prior activities on our websites and vice versa. We may also combine information about your online activities with your activity in a Lowe’s store using our mobile applications.
We may also utilize third-party services that may allow us to associate your prior Lowe’s online or in-store transaction data, operating system, user-agent string, IP address, internet browser, installed fonts and similar information with a pseudonymized ID, which can then be used to target Lowe’s advertising to you on other websites and online platforms.
To provide you with a consistent shopping experience, we may also associate various devices you utilize (e.g., smartphones, tablets and desktop computers) by using the information we collect about you. We may combine information we collect from your devices with other information we have about you, such as your Lowe’s account information, your interaction with our sites, apps and services and your transaction history.
Social Media Widgets
Our online services may include social media features (e.g., a Facebook “Like” button). These features are connected to third-party platforms and may allow such third parties to collect certain information, such as your IP address and which pages you visit on our websites. When you interact with these features through our services, we will receive your personal information from the third party and you agree to share data, including personal information, about your interactions with our service with these third parties. We may also receive personal information identifying you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or “friends.” These social media features are not operated by Lowe’s. Personal information collected and stored by the third-party platform is subject to that third party’s privacy practices and is governed by their privacy policy. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature; however, we may retain data previously collected.
Links to Other Websites and Use of Third-Party Services
Our websites may link to other websites for your convenience and information. For instance, they may link to websites of product suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any website that we do not control and that does not point to this Privacy Statement.
We partner with third parties including delivery services to assist you with your shopping. You may have the opportunity to link your MyLowe’s Rewards Account to your account with that third party. If you choose to do so, that third party will share your personal information with us. Your personal information submitted to the third party is subject to the privacy policy and terms of that respective third party.
We may use automated license plate readers (ALPRs) where permitted by law and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. ALPR systems are high-speed, computer-controlled camera systems that can automatically capture still images of a vehicle’s license plate number that come into view, along with the corresponding location, date and time (collectively, “ALPR Data”).
Purposes.
We use ALPR systems for safety and security, fraud prevention and asset-protection purposes.
Authorized Users; Training; Owner of ALPR Systems.
Select associates in Lowe’s Asset Protection, Information Technology, Global Security, Legal and Facilities departments are authorized to use or access the ALPR systems. Associates who have access to ALPR Data undergo training on the proper access and use of the ALPR systems and the collection and use of ALPR Data in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and this ALPR Policy. Lowe’s is the custodian and owner of the ALPR systems and select associates in Lowe’s Asset Protection department are responsible for implementing the requirements in this ALPR Policy.
Monitoring.
For the security of ALPR Data and to comply with applicable laws and this ALPR Policy, we will maintain and periodically review our ALPR systems access records, including to verify that only authorized users have access to ALPR Data.
Sharing of ALPR Data.
ALPR Data will not be sold, shared or transferred to other persons outside of Lowe’s, except we may share ALPR Data with (i) our service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as to provide ALPR system maintenance and improvement, (ii) law enforcement upon appropriate request and solely in connection with criminal investigations, and (iii) other third parties in order to protect the safety, security and rights of our customers, associates and visitors and to comply with legal requirements, processes and obligations.
Accuracy of ALPR Data; Retention.
To ensure the accuracy of ALPR Data and identify and correct ALPR Data errors, we will periodically compare recorded license plate readings against license plate images captured by our ALPR systems and will correct errors when identified. We will retain ALPR Data for 90 days or for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it. We will regularly delete ALPR Data when we determine that retention of ALPR Data is no longer necessary, but we reserve the right to retain ALPR Data to comply with legal requirements or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Statement, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual. Where we maintain de-identified data, we will maintain and use the data in de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the data except as required or permitted by law.
The Privacy Statement covers the privacy practice of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and its U.S. operating subsidiaries and affiliates (“Lowe’s”), except as outlined below. It applies to personal information about a prospective, current or former Lowe’s customer, visitor or business partner.
In some cases, we may provide additional details about privacy practices specific to a particular operation or location. For example, some of our websites may provide additional privacy details unique to that website, or some stores may post additional privacy details specific to that store or an event such as an in-store experience.
This Privacy Statement
does not apply
to:
Lowe’s job applicant-related and employment-related records.
Your interactions with third parties or their websites that are linked to or accessible from Lowe’s websites or that are operated by unaffiliated parties, even though the website may contain references to Lowe’s.

This Privacy Statement applies to your interaction with Lowe’s as a prospective, current or former Lowe’s customer, visitor or business partner. It describes how Lowe’s collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information from and about you, along with choices you can make about such information. This Privacy Statement is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations.
We collect the following categories of personal information in order to provide products and services to you, to communicate with you, to enhance our products, services, and operations, and for other operational, legal, and compliance purposes:
Identification information
that can be used to identify you, such as your name, alias, address, phone number, email address, payment information, login and access credentials, signatures, or other identifiers. We may also collect online identifiers, such as your IP address, when you browse our websites or use our applications.
Commercial information,
such as products or services you purchased or considered purchasing, information about your participation in contests, sweepstakes, or promotions.
Online activities information,
such as browsing history, search history, and other information when you interact with our websites, applications, and advertisements, such as keystroke activity.
Geolocation data,
including precise geolocation data if you allow our application to collect it for purposes such as helping you locate the nearest Lowe’s store or alerting our stores when you are on the way to pick up your orders, in connection with specific services we may offer (such as store map), or for analytic purposes.
Audio, electronic, video or image information,
such as audio or video recording when you visit our stores, parking lot, or interact with us by phone or virtually. Photos taken when we are working on your project to document progress or completion. When legally permitted, after detecting a security incident for investigation and prosecution purposes, we may use image scan technology on images we previously captured to identify any suspected individual(s). Our cameras may capture license plate information when permitted in certain states.
Professional or employment-related information,
such as information about you as representatives of our customers and business partners, in connection with our services and the operation of our business, including business contact information, job title, company name, and office visitor access information, where applicable.
Protected class information under state or federal laws,
such as age, gender, and family status.
Education information,
such as when you respond to a customer survey.
Inferences or preferences
we learn or infer about you.
Sensitive Personal Information,
such as precise geolocation, race and ethnicity information, government ID, and payment card information when permitted by law. For instance, with your consent, we use precise geolocation to calculate your arrival time for in-store product pickup, so the products are ready for you upon your arrival. We may collect government-issued ID for certain types of transactions such as returns without receipts.
Other personal information,
if it identifies, relates and can be reasonably associated with or linked to you (or your household), such as photos you upload, or measurement data or floorplan data generated when using Lowe’s measurement services or through measurement technologies, such as the Lowe’s Measure Your Space or floor/kitchen visualization features.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal information so that it is non-personal information, such as aggregating (combining it with data about other individuals) and/or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as “hashing,” or otherwise removing characteristics that make the data personally identifiable to you. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal information to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. If we combine non-personal information with personal information, then we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Statement.
We do not knowingly collect or disclose personal information from children under the age of 16 without parental or guardian consent.
If a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us so that the information can be deleted.

Global Privacy Control (GPC) and Do Not Track (DNT).
GPC and DNT are offered by some web browsers and are settings that automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences.

You can learn more about and set up GPC here: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about and set up Do Not Track here: http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Material Program Terms.
A summary of the program and material terms are provided in the links associated with each program listed above or are otherwise provided in the program offer (e.g., via email). Programs are subject to termination at any time at our sole discretion.
Information Collected in the Programs.
In order to participate in some of these programs, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as
identification information
(e.g., name, email address, phone number, mailing address, and payment information). We also collect your
online activities and commercial information
(e.g., transaction history). You may choose to provide other personal information (e.g., measurement data, information related to your property, picture of your premises). You may indicate your preferences in your online account. We may make inferences (e.g., shopping preferences) based on your account activities.
How We Share Information Collected in the Programs.
We share information collected in Programs for purposes and to unaffiliated entities disclosed in
How We Share Information
section. For instance, when necessary, we disclose your information to service providers for purposes including installation, repair, warranty, order processing and fulfillment, information technology, marketing, customer service, data analytics, research and enhancement, fraud prevention, product recall, and legal, compliance and risk management. We may use and share all categories of information collected through the Programs described above with advertising networks, social media sites, data analytics vendors and internet service providers to provide targeted advertising about our products and services relevant to you. You may opt out of targeted advertising by following the steps in the
How to Submit Privacy Request(s) section
. Our tailored offers and promotions may not be accessible if you opt out from targeted advertising.
How to Withdraw From the Programs
. Participation in any financial incentive program is optional at the time of sign-up, and participants may withdraw from the program at any time.
To opt-out of ongoing discount, loyalty or rewards programs associated with your online account, you may contact customer service to deactivate the account. For discounts associated with Lowe’s private-labeled payment cards, you may choose to cancel the card with the financial institution.
To opt out of the program and forgo any ongoing incentives, you may unsubscribe from our marketing communications for communication-based incentives. For California residents, you may email privacy@lowes.com with the subject line “Financial Incentive Opt-Out” (please include your name, address, email and the name of the applicable program).
Impact of Deletion on MyLowe’s Rewards or MyLowe’s Pro Rewards Account.
Our programs are based on points which accrue to your unique membership identification number based on your purchases. Without the ability to relate and track your transactions to the membership identification number that will be deleted as a result of your deletion request, we will be unable to provide you with access to your member-only benefits that we may offer from time to time. Additionally, we will be unable to recover your account after deletion.
If you choose to exercise your data privacy rights such that your Rewards Program is impacted, we will notify you the consequences of your decision prior to discontinuing your membership or benefits.
The financial incentives we offer to customers are reasonably related to the value of the customer’s data to our business, based on our reasonable but sole determination. We estimate the value of customers’ personal information by considering the expenses incurred by the business related to the collection, storage and retention of personal information in the context of the program and the expenses related to the provision of the program. The value to our business of any individual customer’s personal information is based on specific facts such as whether and to what extent you take advantage of any offerings and whether and to what extent you opt out of any offerings. We do not calculate the value of customer data in our accounting statements. From time to time, we may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive program, which will be presented to you at the time you sign up for the program.
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed and intended to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Despite these safeguards, due to inherent uncertainty in the use of the internet and information systems and the potential for unlawful attacks by third parties, we cannot guarantee that the use of our systems, websites or applications will be completely safe or secure.
We retain personal information only for as long as is
reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, comply
with our legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. To
determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we
consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the
potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal
information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our
legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.
Once retention of the personal
information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will
either delete or deidentify the personal information or, if this is not
possible (for example, because personal information has been stored in backup
archives), then we will store and protect the personal information until
deletion or deidentification is possible.
Do Not Track
We do not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser that enable customer choice regarding the collection of personal information about one’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. For more information about how we respond to other opt-out preference signals such as the Global Privacy Control, please refer to the “
How to Submit Privacy Request(s)
” section above.
Cookies and Other Technologies
Cookies refer to small packets of data that websites send to your computer or other internet-connected devices. Lowe’s and our business partners use them for different purposes. These technologies can uniquely identify your browser and log information, such as your device type, system and browser information, IP address, system language, location and your interactions with the site. Like other websites, we need some essential cookies for our website to function properly. We also use some functional cookies to pre-populate your log-in ID to make it easier for you, or to help us remember where you left off when you shopped, so you do not have to restart all over again. We may use browser cookies, flash cookies and other types of local storage.
We, and our third-party partners may record your keystroke activity and rhythms, mouse movements, scrolling and clicks when you use our websites or mobile applications for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve our products and services, and to address functionality issues.
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect data about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third-party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with our services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from our services.
We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) to collect data through mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network data, and website usage behavior. SDKs are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps including those that collect data from your device.
Lowe’s and our business partners also use cookies with other technologies, such as web tags, beacons or pixels. They allow us to count visitors to our webpages, evaluate the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or recommend relevant products and services to you when you browse social media or other websites. We think these technologies create meaningful interactions with you and are helpful, but you can let us know that you prefer otherwise by opting out from these advertising cookies and technologies by clicking below. You can find more information and options in
Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising
section. We may also use third-party web analytics services in our online services to help us analyze how users use our online services.
Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising
We collect data about your activities on our websites and applications for use in providing tailored advertising, and we may share information about activities on our websites with advertising networks administered by third parties. These ad networks track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. As a result, you may see certain ads on other websites based on prior activities on our websites and vice versa. We may also combine information about your online activities with your activity in a Lowe’s store using our mobile applications.
We may also utilize third-party services that may allow us to associate your prior Lowe’s online or in-store transaction data, operating system, user-agent string, IP address, internet browser, installed fonts and similar information with a pseudonymized ID, which can then be used to target Lowe’s advertising to you on other websites and online platforms.
To provide you with a consistent shopping experience, we may also associate various devices you utilize (e.g., smartphones, tablets and desktop computers) by using the information we collect about you. We may combine information we collect from your devices with other information we have about you, such as your Lowe’s account information, your interaction with our sites, apps and services and your transaction history.
Social Media Widgets
Our online services may include social media features (e.g., a Facebook “Like” button). These features are connected to third-party platforms and may allow such third parties to collect certain information, such as your IP address and which pages you visit on our websites. When you interact with these features through our services, we will receive your personal information from the third party and you agree to share data, including personal information, about your interactions with our service with these third parties. We may also receive personal information identifying you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or “friends.” These social media features are not operated by Lowe’s. Personal information collected and stored by the third-party platform is subject to that third party’s privacy practices and is governed by their privacy policy. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature; however, we may retain data previously collected.
Links to Other Websites and Use of Third-Party Services
Our websites may link to other websites for your convenience and information. For instance, they may link to websites of product suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any website that we do not control and that does not point to this Privacy Statement.
We partner with third parties including delivery services to assist you with your shopping. You may have the opportunity to link your MyLowe’s Rewards Account to your account with that third party. If you choose to do so, that third party will share your personal information with us. Your personal information submitted to the third party is subject to the privacy policy and terms of that respective third party.
We may use automated license plate readers (ALPRs) where permitted by law and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. ALPR systems are high-speed, computer-controlled camera systems that can automatically capture still images of a vehicle’s license plate number that come into view, along with the corresponding location, date and time (collectively, “ALPR Data”).
Purposes.
We use ALPR systems for safety and security, fraud prevention and asset-protection purposes.
Authorized Users; Training; Owner of ALPR Systems.
Select associates in Lowe’s Asset Protection, Information Technology, Global Security, Legal and Facilities departments are authorized to use or access the ALPR systems. Associates who have access to ALPR Data undergo training on the proper access and use of the ALPR systems and the collection and use of ALPR Data in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and this ALPR Policy. Lowe’s is the custodian and owner of the ALPR systems and select associates in Lowe’s Asset Protection department are responsible for implementing the requirements in this ALPR Policy.
Monitoring.
For the security of ALPR Data and to comply with applicable laws and this ALPR Policy, we will maintain and periodically review our ALPR systems access records, including to verify that only authorized users have access to ALPR Data.
Sharing of ALPR Data.
ALPR Data will not be sold, shared or transferred to other persons outside of Lowe’s, except we may share ALPR Data with (i) our service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as to provide ALPR system maintenance and improvement, (ii) law enforcement upon appropriate request and solely in connection with criminal investigations, and (iii) other third parties in order to protect the safety, security and rights of our customers, associates and visitors and to comply with legal requirements, processes and obligations.
Accuracy of ALPR Data; Retention.
To ensure the accuracy of ALPR Data and identify and correct ALPR Data errors, we will periodically compare recorded license plate readings against license plate images captured by our ALPR systems and will correct errors when identified. We will retain ALPR Data for 90 days or for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it. We will regularly delete ALPR Data when we determine that retention of ALPR Data is no longer necessary, but we reserve the right to retain ALPR Data to comply with legal requirements or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Statement, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual. Where we maintain de-identified data, we will maintain and use the data in de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the data except as required or permitted by law.
The Privacy Statement covers the privacy practice of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and its U.S. operating subsidiaries and affiliates (“Lowe’s”), except as outlined below. It applies to personal information about a prospective, current or former Lowe’s customer, visitor or business partner.
In some cases, we may provide additional details about privacy practices specific to a particular operation or location. For example, some of our websites may provide additional privacy details unique to that website, or some stores may post additional privacy details specific to that store or an event such as an in-store experience.
This Privacy Statement
does not apply
to:
Lowe’s job applicant-related and employment-related records.
Your interactions with third parties or their websites that are linked to or accessible from Lowe’s websites or that are operated by unaffiliated parties, even though the website may contain references to Lowe’s.

Credit-related products (such as Lowe’s-branded credit cards), which are covered by the issuing banks’ privacy notices.

This Privacy Statement applies to your interaction with Lowe’s as a prospective, current or former Lowe’s customer, visitor or business partner. It describes how Lowe’s collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information from and about you, along with choices you can make about such information. This Privacy Statement is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations.
We collect the following categories of personal information in order to provide products and services to you, to communicate with you, to enhance our products, services, and operations, and for other operational, legal, and compliance purposes:
Identification information
that can be used to identify you, such as your name, alias, address, phone number, email address, payment information, login and access credentials, signatures, or other identifiers. We may also collect online identifiers, such as your IP address, when you browse our websites or use our applications.
Commercial information,
such as products or services you purchased or considered purchasing, information about your participation in contests, sweepstakes, or promotions.
Online activities information,
such as browsing history, search history, and other information when you interact with our websites, applications, and advertisements, such as keystroke activity.
Geolocation data,
including precise geolocation data if you allow our application to collect it for purposes such as helping you locate the nearest Lowe’s store or alerting our stores when you are on the way to pick up your orders, in connection with specific services we may offer (such as store map), or for analytic purposes.
Audio, electronic, video or image information,
such as audio or video recording when you visit our stores, parking lot, or interact with us by phone or virtually. Photos taken when we are working on your project to document progress or completion. When legally permitted, after detecting a security incident for investigation and prosecution purposes, we may use image scan technology on images we previously captured to identify any suspected individual(s). Our cameras may capture license plate information when permitted in certain states.
Professional or employment-related information,
such as information about you as representatives of our customers and business partners, in connection with our services and the operation of our business, including business contact information, job title, company name, and office visitor access information, where applicable.
Protected class information under state or federal laws,
such as age, gender, and family status.
Education information,
such as when you respond to a customer survey.
Inferences or preferences
we learn or infer about you.
Sensitive Personal Information,
such as precise geolocation, race and ethnicity information, government ID, and payment card information when permitted by law. For instance, with your consent, we use precise geolocation to calculate your arrival time for in-store product pickup, so the products are ready for you upon your arrival. We may collect government-issued ID for certain types of transactions such as returns without receipts.
Other personal information,
if it identifies, relates and can be reasonably associated with or linked to you (or your household), such as photos you upload, or measurement data or floorplan data generated when using Lowe’s measurement services or through measurement technologies, such as the Lowe’s Measure Your Space or floor/kitchen visualization features.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal information so that it is non-personal information, such as aggregating (combining it with data about other individuals) and/or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as “hashing,” or otherwise removing characteristics that make the data personally identifiable to you. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal information to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. If we combine non-personal information with personal information, then we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Statement.
We do not knowingly collect or disclose personal information from children under the age of 16 without parental or guardian consent.
If a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us so that the information can be deleted.

Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets
We reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you (including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process) if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including, without limitation, in the event of a reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or liquidation).
Categories of Personal Information Disclosed for Business Purposes

section below for information on industry tools and device settings that may be available to you.
Global Privacy Control (GPC) and Do Not Track (DNT).
GPC and DNT are offered by some web browsers and are settings that automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences. When you choose to turn on the GPC/DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug-in providers, and/or other web services you encounter while browsing to exercise your privacy rights and stop tracking your activity. You can learn more about and set up GPC here: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about and set up Do Not Track here: http://www.allaboutdnt.com. We comply with GPC as required under applicable law, but because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them.
Nevada Residents.
Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes permits a Nevada resident to opt out of future sales of certain “covered information” that a website operator has collected or will collect about the resident. While we do not currently sell “covered information” as defined under Nevada law, if you reside in Nevada, you have the right to submit a request to privacy@lowes.com to opt out of the future sale of covered information.

Interest-Based and Other Targeted Advertising
You can adjust your cookie preference clicking the link below. Essential and functional cookies cannot be disabled nor can the tool be used to block cookies on third-party websites linked from our website.
Some of the companies we use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“
NAI
”) or Digital Advertising Alliance (“
DAA
”). The
NAI
provides information regarding targeted advertising and the
opt-out procedures of NAI members,
including opt-out mechanisms for web browsers, mobile and other connected devices, and a tool to opt out from participating NAI members using your hashed email address for interest-based advertising. The

DAA
participating companies, click
here
.
Manage Cookies
Mobile devices may contain settings that allow you to disable tracking advertising and/or analytics. In addition, the digital advertising industry has provided the ability for mobile users to register at
AppChoices
for their intent not to receive targeted advertising.
Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising, and that you will continue to receive generic ads while online. Your opt-out choices are browser and device specific; if you disable your cookies, upgrade your browser after opting out or if you use multiple different devices, please opt out on each device and each browser separately.
In-Store Wi-Fi
To stop the collection of information via in-store Wi-Fi, disconnect from the in-store Wi-Fi network.
Website Analytics Services
We use certain analytics services, such as Site Catalyst by Adobe Analytics, to gather information about our site visits or mobile app usage. To learn more about your privacy choices on Adobe Analytics, including opting out of personal information collection by Adobe, please click
here
.
We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze data about the use of the Services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect data about the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can
learn about Google’s practices
, and opt out of them by downloading the
Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on
.
We offer various financial incentives, including price discounts, coupons, services, and other perks. For example, the financial incentives programs we may provide include (collectively, the “Programs”):
MyLowe’s Rewards Program
, where do-it-yourself participants have access to rewards, offers and promotions (see additional terms

Military Discount
Program participants have access to discounts (see additional terms
here
); and
Lowe’s private-labeled credit cards
or
preloaded payment card
programs, whereby participants have access to discounts. We partner with financial institutions such as Synchrony and American Express to provide Lowe’s private-labeled credit cards and with Sunrise Banks to provide preloaded payment cards. See program terms linked above for benefits provided.
Material Program Terms.
A summary of the program and material terms are provided in the links associated with each program listed above or are otherwise provided in the program offer (e.g., via email). Programs are subject to termination at any time at our sole discretion.
Information Collected in the Programs.
In order to participate in some of these programs, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as
identification information
(e.g., name, email address, phone number, mailing address, and payment information). We also collect your
online activities and commercial information
(e.g., transaction history). You may choose to provide other personal information (e.g., measurement data, information related to your property, picture of your premises). You may indicate your preferences in your online account. We may make inferences (e.g., shopping preferences) based on your account activities.
How We Share Information Collected in the Programs.
We share information collected in Programs for purposes and to unaffiliated entities disclosed in
How We Share Information
section. For instance, when necessary, we disclose your information to service providers for purposes including installation, repair, warranty, order processing and fulfillment, information technology, marketing, customer service, data analytics, research and enhancement, fraud prevention, product recall, and legal, compliance and risk management. We may use and share all categories of information collected through the Programs described above with advertising networks, social media sites, data analytics vendors and internet service providers to provide targeted advertising about our products and services relevant to you. You may opt out of targeted advertising by following the steps in the
How to Submit Privacy Request(s) section
. Our tailored offers and promotions may not be accessible if you opt out from targeted advertising.
How to Withdraw From the Programs
. Participation in any financial incentive program is optional at the time of sign-up, and participants may withdraw from the program at any time.
To opt-out of ongoing discount, loyalty or rewards programs associated with your online account, you may contact customer service to deactivate the account. For discounts associated with Lowe’s private-labeled payment cards, you may choose to cancel the card with the financial institution.
To opt out of the program and forgo any ongoing incentives, you may unsubscribe from our marketing communications for communication-based incentives. For California residents, you may email privacy@lowes.com with the subject line “Financial Incentive Opt-Out” (please include your name, address, email and the name of the applicable program).
Impact of Deletion on MyLowe’s Rewards or MyLowe’s Pro Rewards Account.
Our programs are based on points which accrue to your unique membership identification number based on your purchases. Without the ability to relate and track your transactions to the membership identification number that will be deleted as a result of your deletion request, we will be unable to provide you with access to your member-only benefits that we may offer from time to time. Additionally, we will be unable to recover your account after deletion.
If you choose to exercise your data privacy rights such that your Rewards Program is impacted, we will notify you the consequences of your decision prior to discontinuing your membership or benefits.
The financial incentives we offer to customers are reasonably related to the value of the customer’s data to our business, based on our reasonable but sole determination. We estimate the value of customers’ personal information by considering the expenses incurred by the business related to the collection, storage and retention of personal information in the context of the program and the expenses related to the provision of the program. The value to our business of any individual customer’s personal information is based on specific facts such as whether and to what extent you take advantage of any offerings and whether and to what extent you opt out of any offerings. We do not calculate the value of customer data in our accounting statements. From time to time, we may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive program, which will be presented to you at the time you sign up for the program.
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed and intended to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Despite these safeguards, due to inherent uncertainty in the use of the internet and information systems and the potential for unlawful attacks by third parties, we cannot guarantee that the use of our systems, websites or applications will be completely safe or secure.
We retain personal information only for as long as is
reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, comply
with our legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. To
determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we
consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the
potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal
information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our
legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.
Once retention of the personal
information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will
either delete or deidentify the personal information or, if this is not
possible (for example, because personal information has been stored in backup
archives), then we will store and protect the personal information until
deletion or deidentification is possible.
Do Not Track
We do not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser that enable customer choice regarding the collection of personal information about one’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. For more information about how we respond to other opt-out preference signals such as the Global Privacy Control, please refer to the “
How to Submit Privacy Request(s)
” section above.
Cookies and Other Technologies
Cookies refer to small packets of data that websites send to your computer or other internet-connected devices. Lowe’s and our business partners use them for different purposes. These technologies can uniquely identify your browser and log information, such as your device type, system and browser information, IP address, system language, location and your interactions with the site. Like other websites, we need some essential cookies for our website to function properly. We also use some functional cookies to pre-populate your log-in ID to make it easier for you, or to help us remember where you left off when you shopped, so you do not have to restart all over again. We may use browser cookies, flash cookies and other types of local storage.
We, and our third-party partners may record your keystroke activity and rhythms, mouse movements, scrolling and clicks when you use our websites or mobile applications for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve our products and services, and to address functionality issues.
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect data about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third-party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with our services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from our services.
We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) to collect data through mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network data, and website usage behavior. SDKs are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps including those that collect data from your device.
Lowe’s and our business partners also use cookies with other technologies, such as web tags, beacons or pixels. They allow us to count visitors to our webpages, evaluate the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or recommend relevant products and services to you when you browse social media or other websites. We think these technologies create meaningful interactions with you and are helpful, but you can let us know that you prefer otherwise by opting out from these advertising cookies and technologies by clicking below. You can find more information and options in
Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising
section. We may also use third-party web analytics services in our online services to help us analyze how users use our online services.
Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising
We collect data about your activities on our websites and applications for use in providing tailored advertising, and we may share information about activities on our websites with advertising networks administered by third parties. These ad networks track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. As a result, you may see certain ads on other websites based on prior activities on our websites and vice versa. We may also combine information about your online activities with your activity in a Lowe’s store using our mobile applications.
We may also utilize third-party services that may allow us to associate your prior Lowe’s online or in-store transaction data, operating system, user-agent string, IP address, internet browser, installed fonts and similar information with a pseudonymized ID, which can then be used to target Lowe’s advertising to you on other websites and online platforms.
To provide you with a consistent shopping experience, we may also associate various devices you utilize (e.g., smartphones, tablets and desktop computers) by using the information we collect about you. We may combine information we collect from your devices with other information we have about you, such as your Lowe’s account information, your interaction with our sites, apps and services and your transaction history.
Social Media Widgets
Our online services may include social media features (e.g., a Facebook “Like” button). These features are connected to third-party platforms and may allow such third parties to collect certain information, such as your IP address and which pages you visit on our websites. When you interact with these features through our services, we will receive your personal information from the third party and you agree to share data, including personal information, about your interactions with our service with these third parties. We may also receive personal information identifying you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or “friends.” These social media features are not operated by Lowe’s. Personal information collected and stored by the third-party platform is subject to that third party’s privacy practices and is governed by their privacy policy. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature; however, we may retain data previously collected.
Links to Other Websites and Use of Third-Party Services
Our websites may link to other websites for your convenience and information. For instance, they may link to websites of product suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any website that we do not control and that does not point to this Privacy Statement.
We partner with third parties including delivery services to assist you with your shopping. You may have the opportunity to link your MyLowe’s Rewards Account to your account with that third party. If you choose to do so, that third party will share your personal information with us. Your personal information submitted to the third party is subject to the privacy policy and terms of that respective third party.
We may use automated license plate readers (ALPRs) where permitted by law and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. ALPR systems are high-speed, computer-controlled camera systems that can automatically capture still images of a vehicle’s license plate number that come into view, along with the corresponding location, date and time (collectively, “ALPR Data”).
Purposes.
We use ALPR systems for safety and security, fraud prevention and asset-protection purposes.
Authorized Users; Training; Owner of ALPR Systems.
Select associates in Lowe’s Asset Protection, Information Technology, Global Security, Legal and Facilities departments are authorized to use or access the ALPR systems. Associates who have access to ALPR Data undergo training on the proper access and use of the ALPR systems and the collection and use of ALPR Data in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and this ALPR Policy. Lowe’s is the custodian and owner of the ALPR systems and select associates in Lowe’s Asset Protection department are responsible for implementing the requirements in this ALPR Policy.
Monitoring.
For the security of ALPR Data and to comply with applicable laws and this ALPR Policy, we will maintain and periodically review our ALPR systems access records, including to verify that only authorized users have access to ALPR Data.
Sharing of ALPR Data.
ALPR Data will not be sold, shared or transferred to other persons outside of Lowe’s, except we may share ALPR Data with (i) our service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as to provide ALPR system maintenance and improvement, (ii) law enforcement upon appropriate request and solely in connection with criminal investigations, and (iii) other third parties in order to protect the safety, security and rights of our customers, associates and visitors and to comply with legal requirements, processes and obligations.
Accuracy of ALPR Data; Retention.
To ensure the accuracy of ALPR Data and identify and correct ALPR Data errors, we will periodically compare recorded license plate readings against license plate images captured by our ALPR systems and will correct errors when identified. We will retain ALPR Data for 90 days or for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it. We will regularly delete ALPR Data when we determine that retention of ALPR Data is no longer necessary, but we reserve the right to retain ALPR Data to comply with legal requirements or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Statement, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual. Where we maintain de-identified data, we will maintain and use the data in de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the data except as required or permitted by law.
The Privacy Statement covers the privacy practice of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and its U.S. operating subsidiaries and affiliates (“Lowe’s”), except as outlined below. It applies to personal information about a prospective, current or former Lowe’s customer, visitor or business partner.
In some cases, we may provide additional details about privacy practices specific to a particular operation or location. For example, some of our websites may provide additional privacy details unique to that website, or some stores may post additional privacy details specific to that store or an event such as an in-store experience.
This Privacy Statement
does not apply
to:
Lowe’s job applicant-related and employment-related records.
Your interactions with third parties or their websites that are linked to or accessible from Lowe’s websites or that are operated by unaffiliated parties, even though the website may contain references to Lowe’s.
