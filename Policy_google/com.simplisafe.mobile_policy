By using the Site and/or providing Personal Information to us, you consent to transfer of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
9. CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in the United States or other jurisdictions where SimpliSafe and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and service providers operate. These locations are required to operate with redundancies.
If we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts with standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914 and the international data transfer addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses version B.1.0 issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office and laid before Parliament in accordance with s119A of the Data Protection Act 2018 on 2 February 2022, as it is revised under Section 18 of the UK Addendum.
In addition, SimpliSafe certifies to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it complies with the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and more specifically the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) Principles, which apply to the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) Principles, which apply to the Swiss-U.S. These lay out a set of requirements governing participating organizations’ use and treatment of personal data received from the European Union and, as applicable, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), as well as the access and recourse mechanisms that participants must provide to EU and, as applicable, UK individuals. The Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles likewise lay out a set of requirements governing participating organizations’ use and treatment of personal data received from Switzerland, as well as the access and recourse mechanisms that participants must provide to Swiss individuals.  Once an organization publicly commits to comply with the DPF Principles, that commitment is enforceable under U.S. law.
To the extent that SimpliSafe has responsibility for the processing of personal data it receives under DPF and makes an onward transfer to a third party acting as an agent, processor, or sub-processor, SimpliSafe may remain liable under DPF, unless the recipient processes such personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF.
If this Privacy Policy conflicts with applicable DPF Principles, the DPF Principles will govern and the rest will remain in effect.
To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please
visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Data Privacy Framework website
.
If you have a question or complaint related to SimpliSafe’s participation in DPF, you are encouraged to contact us via the mechanisms in paragraph 11. For any complaints related to the DPF that SimpliSafe cannot resolve directly, SimpliSafe will cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, the UK Information Commissioner (for UK individuals), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.
Binding arbitration is also available to address residual DPF complaints not resolved by other means.
SimpliSafe is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

8. VISITORS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting the Site from outside the United States, your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or other countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The data protection and other applicable laws of the United States or these other countries may not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from the data protection or consumer protection laws in your country. Your Personal Information may be available to government authorities under lawful orders and law applicable in such jurisdictions. By using the Site and/or providing Personal Information to us, you consent to transfer of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
9. CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in the United States or other jurisdictions where SimpliSafe and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and service providers operate. These locations are required to operate with redundancies.
If we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts with standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914 and the international data transfer addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses version B.1.0 issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office and laid before Parliament in accordance with s119A of the Data Protection Act 2018 on 2 February 2022, as it is revised under Section 18 of the UK Addendum.
In addition, SimpliSafe certifies to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it complies with the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and more specifically the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) Principles, which apply to the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) Principles, which apply to the Swiss-U.S. These lay out a set of requirements governing participating organizations’ use and treatment of personal data received from the European Union and, as applicable, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), as well as the access and recourse mechanisms that participants must provide to EU and, as applicable, UK individuals. The Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles likewise lay out a set of requirements governing participating organizations’ use and treatment of personal data received from Switzerland, as well as the access and recourse mechanisms that participants must provide to Swiss individuals.  Once an organization publicly commits to comply with the DPF Principles, that commitment is enforceable under U.S. law.
To the extent that SimpliSafe has responsibility for the processing of personal data it receives under DPF and makes an onward transfer to a third party acting as an agent, processor, or sub-processor, SimpliSafe may remain liable under DPF, unless the recipient processes such personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF.
If this Privacy Policy conflicts with applicable DPF Principles, the DPF Principles will govern and the rest will remain in effect.
To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please
visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Data Privacy Framework website
.
If you have a question or complaint related to SimpliSafe’s participation in DPF, you are encouraged to contact us via the mechanisms in paragraph 11. For any complaints related to the DPF that SimpliSafe cannot resolve directly, SimpliSafe will cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, the UK Information Commissioner (for UK individuals), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.
Binding arbitration is also available to address residual DPF complaints not resolved by other means.
SimpliSafe is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
The following applies to residents of the United Kingdom that interact with Simplisafe subject to our
UK Privacy Policy
.
You can access and update certain information we have relating to your online account by logging into your online account and visiting the “monitoring” section to update contact information for your alarm monitoring and dispatch. Under the “log in” section you can update your email address and password.
You can opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional emails from SimpliSafe by using the opt-out or unsubscribe feature contained in the e-mails. Or you can access the page and

Please note that you have rights to obtain a copy of your personal data and in certain situations to obtain correction, erasure and restriction of processing of your personal data. You also have a right of data portability. These rights are subject to applicable law.
Where processing is based on your consent you have a right to withdraw this consent at any time.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the personal information we have about you and/or how we handle your personal data, or if you wish to exercise any of the rights described in this section please contact us at 0800 456 1789 or via email at

8. VISITORS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting the Site from outside the United States, your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or other countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The data protection and other applicable laws of the United States or these other countries may not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from the data protection or consumer protection laws in your country. Your Personal Information may be available to government authorities under lawful orders and law applicable in such jurisdictions. By using the Site and/or providing Personal Information to us, you consent to transfer of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
9. CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in the United States or other jurisdictions where SimpliSafe and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and service providers operate. These locations are required to operate with redundancies.
If we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts with standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914 and the international data transfer addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses version B.1.0 issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office and laid before Parliament in accordance with s119A of the Data Protection Act 2018 on 2 February 2022, as it is revised under Section 18 of the UK Addendum.
In addition, SimpliSafe certifies to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it complies with the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and more specifically the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) Principles, which apply to the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) Principles, which apply to the Swiss-U.S. These lay out a set of requirements governing participating organizations’ use and treatment of personal data received from the European Union and, as applicable, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), as well as the access and recourse mechanisms that participants must provide to EU and, as applicable, UK individuals. The Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles likewise lay out a set of requirements governing participating organizations’ use and treatment of personal data received from Switzerland, as well as the access and recourse mechanisms that participants must provide to Swiss individuals.  Once an organization publicly commits to comply with the DPF Principles, that commitment is enforceable under U.S. law.
To the extent that SimpliSafe has responsibility for the processing of personal data it receives under DPF and makes an onward transfer to a third party acting as an agent, processor, or sub-processor, SimpliSafe may remain liable under DPF, unless the recipient processes such personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF.
If this Privacy Policy conflicts with applicable DPF Principles, the DPF Principles will govern and the rest will remain in effect.
To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please
visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Data Privacy Framework website
.
If you have a question or complaint related to SimpliSafe’s participation in DPF, you are encouraged to contact us via the mechanisms in paragraph 11. For any complaints related to the DPF that SimpliSafe cannot resolve directly, SimpliSafe will cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, the UK Information Commissioner (for UK individuals), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.
Binding arbitration is also available to address residual DPF complaints not resolved by other means.
SimpliSafe is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
The following applies to residents of the United Kingdom that interact with Simplisafe subject to our
UK Privacy Policy
.
You can access and update certain information we have relating to your online account by logging into your online account and visiting the “monitoring” section to update contact information for your alarm monitoring and dispatch. Under the “log in” section you can update your email address and password.
You can opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional emails from SimpliSafe by using the opt-out or unsubscribe feature contained in the e-mails. Or you can access the page and
unsubscribe here

Please note that you have rights to obtain a copy of your personal data and in certain situations to obtain correction, erasure and restriction of processing of your personal data. You also have a right of data portability. These rights are subject to applicable law.
Where processing is based on your consent you have a right to withdraw this consent at any time.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the personal information we have about you and/or how we handle your personal data, or if you wish to exercise any of the rights described in this section please contact us at 0800 456 1789 or via email at

Privacy Supplement for SimpliSafe® Active Guard
Last Updated: December 2024
This Privacy Supplement for SimpliSafe® Active Guard (“Privacy Supplement”) incorporates the SimpliSafe Privacy Policy, which is posted at
https://simplisafe.com/legal/privacy-policy
. Together these privacy statements describe our privacy practices for SimpliSafe Active Guard outdoor protection. Capitalized terms, if not defined in this Privacy Supplement, are defined in the SimpliSafe Privacy Policy. In the event of a conflict, the terms of this Privacy Supplement will control.
NOTE: Privacy laws in your state may impose certain obligations on you and your use of the security camera(s) or other camera-enabled products. You (not SimpliSafe) are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use such camera-enabled products. For example, you may be required to provide notice (outside and even inside) to alert visitors that you are using camera-enabled products that are capable of capturing audio, video, and biometric data for security purposes. Please also consider that recording and sharing a video that involves other people may affect their privacy rights and that it is your responsibility to provide notice and obtain consent as required by applicable laws and regulations.
Scope
SimpliSafe takes your privacy seriously. We believe in protecting your information as well as your person and belongings. This Privacy Supplement describes how your equipment may collect, use, and share audio, video, images, and biometric information to provide SimpliSafe® Active Guard.
As such, this Privacy Supplement applies to information we collect in conjunction with SimpliSafe Active Guard. Other information is subject to our SimpliSafe Privacy Policy.
Additional Terms
SimpliSafe services are subject to: the SimpliSafe Terms of Use, which is posted at
https://simplisafe.com/legal/terms-of-use
; the SimpliSafe Terms of Sale, which is posted at
https://simplisafe.com/legal/terms-sale
; and the SimpliSafe Terms of Service, which is posted at
https://simplisafe.com/legal/terms-of-service
. In the event of a conflict, the terms of this Privacy Supplement will control.
Additional Information
To provide security monitoring for SimpliSafe Active Guard, we may collect and process identifiers (e.g., names, addresses, and device identifiers associated with cameras and accounts); system events, video and audio data, such as images, likenesses, facial features, facial embeddings, predictions from AI models (e.g. motion detection, face detection, face recognition, object detection and reidentification) and other information related to individuals who enter camera fields of view, including but not limited to voice recordings, and images of personal property (e.g., name tags, vehicles, license plates); biometrics for purposes of recognizing individuals by image; and inferences based on such information (such as whether an individual is a frequent visitor or a delivery person).
Additional Processing of Data
If you opt-in to let us use your videos to improve our products services we may use your shared video content to improve our Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) models, features, and functionality of our products and services and to develop new features or products as discussed further in our AI Video Sharing Addendum at simplisafe.com/legal/ai-addendum. You may opt-out at any time and this is not required to use SimpliSafe Active Guard.
Biometric Data
You acknowledge and agree you will not use SimpliSafe Active Guard facial recognition features in Illinois, Texas, Oregon (City of Portland), or outside of the United States. If you reside in a location that restricts the collection, processing, or storage of biometric data, you will not be able to enable automatic Face Matching or Familiar Faces in your SimpliSafe app.
To provide SimpliSafe Active Guard, we are utilizing facial recognition features (referred to as “Face Matching”) in your SimpliSafe app. When Face Matching is enabled, we may disclose your videos and images collected via your equipment with third party service providers to enable Face Matching. In such an event, these third party service providers will only be permitted to access, use, and retain biometric information to provide SimpliSafe Active Guard as described herein and only in a manner consistent with this Privacy Supplement and applicable law.
Unless otherwise stated, if you elect to use Face Matching, we will not sell, lease, share, trade, or otherwise improperly profit from your audio, video, images, or any biometric information. Your biometric information will not be used for any additional purposes, unless we provide you with notice of those additional purposes and gather your consent or unless we are required to make a disclosure by Legal Proceedings, as further described in the SimpliSafe Privacy Policy.
How to Enable, Disable, and Delete Biometric Data
Frame Prediction and Profiles
- When one of your cameras enrolled in SimpliSafe Active Guard detects motion, your equipment will automatically transmit video to a service which creates image thumbnails to help illustrate the event on your timeline and enable you to review the event in your SimpliSafe app. You can create a collection of these system generated images and may manually upload images in the SimpliSafe app to aid with identification of an individual (the “Familiar Faces” feature). If you wish to create Familiar Faces, we allow you to add nicknames to your Familiar Faces to help you sort through event videos and assist SimpliSafe Active Guard monitoring agents. If the facial recognition feature detailed below (“Biometric Profiles” section) is turned off or disabled, you can still manually create Familiar Faces and add nicknames. In this case, no biometric information is stored or retained relating to your thumbnail images. You may individually delete Familiar Faces from within the SimpliSafe app or choose to delete all Familiar Faces associated with a particular location.
Biometric Profiles and Embeddings
- Where the facial recognition feature (referred to as “Face Matching” in the SimpliSafe app) is available and enabled, we will create biometric embeddings from thumbnails to systematically identify and compare with individuals that are detected by the system. All of your stored biometric embeddings can be deleted at any time in your SimpliSafe app by toggling “Face Matching” off and selecting “Delete Data”. When facial recognition functionality is disabled or unavailable based on location, the system will never create or store any biometric profiles.
If you create a Familiar Face for a child and enable Face Matching, you represent and warrant that you are their parent or legal guardian capable of giving such consent or that you have obtained consent from the parent or legal guardian of the child.
Where required by law, if you create Familiar Faces for a friend, family member, or other person and enable biometric profiles, you represent and warrant that you obtained their consent, such as a written release, to store and use a Familiar Face profile after notifying them how their biometric information is being collected, stored, and used.
When Face Matching functionality is enabled, SimpliSafe may collect and analyze biometric information regarding unrecognized data subjects when analyzing images for matches to Familiar Faces associated with your account.
How we Protect Biometric Data
We use commercially reasonable physical, technical and administrative security measures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of any Familiar Faces that you create as well as biometric embeddings. To the extent that Familiar Faces and biometric embeddings are created we will store, transmit, and protect such information in the same manner that we protect other confidential and sensitive information.
How we Retain and Destroy Biometric Data
If you create a Familiar Face in your SimpliSafe app, we will retain your Familiar Face and any associated biometric embeddings for no longer than is reasonably necessary to provide you SimpliSafe Active Guard, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods includes: (a) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with our customers and provide services, (b) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, and (c) whether retention is necessary to support our legal positions (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
SimpliSafe Active Guard Video Retention Period
In accordance with our Privacy Policy, we will retain your SimpliSafe Active Guard videos for a maximum of 30 days, unless we are required by law to hold them longer or you grant us specific permission to retain shared video content to improve our products and services.
To delete shared video content, you may opt-out of Recording Access for AI Improvement in your SimpliSafe app, submit an account deletion request through your SimpliSafe app, or submit a state deletion request through our form posted at
https://simplisafe.com/access-delete-info
.

Acceptable Use Policy,
where you can see that Fullstory has high standards regarding how our customers respect your privacy.

California
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), along with the California Privacy Rights Act amendment, provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of information about them, as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit sharing of Personal Information. You have the right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights.
Fullstory may disclose your Personal Information to commercial providers for a business purpose, which includes verifying your identity when you make a payment or registering access to your accounts.  When we disclose Personal Information for these reasons, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not to use it for any purpose except for the purposes set forth in the contract.
To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA, that information and our practices are described in our
Privacy Notice for Californians
page.
Notice at Collection Regarding the Categories of Personal Information Collected
You have the right to receive notice of the categories of Personal Information we collect, and the purposes for which those categories of Personal Information will be used. The categories we use below to describe the information are those enumerated in the CCPA.
Entities to whom we disclose information for business purposes are service providers, which are companies that we engage to conduct activities on our behalf. Service providers are restricted from using Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement.
The following chart describes information we collect when you act as a customer or prospective customer of our products and services or visit our website.

Please review their privacy policies carefully prior to submitting your application materials.
Privacy Rights for Californians
Under the CCPA, California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes Californians' rights and explains how California residents can exercise those rights.
Below we further outline specific rights which California residents may have under the CCPA.
Right to Access Your Data.
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12- month period preceding the receipt of your request.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
Right to Data Portability.
You have the right to a "portable" copy of your Personal Information that you have submitted to us. Generally, this means you have a right to request that we move, copy or transmit your Personal Information stored on our servers or information technology environment to another service provider's servers or information technology environment.
Right to Delete Your Data.
You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
Right of correction
. You have the right to request correction or changes of your Personal Information if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date.
Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights.
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising your privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.
How to Submit a Request
You may submit a request to exercise your rights to know/access or delete your Personal Information through one of two means:
Submit a request via email to
privacy@fullstory.com
, or
Call 1-833-385-5786 to submit your request.
Upon submission of your request, we will contact you via the email address provided in your request.  To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information.  In some instances, such as a request for data deletion, we may first separately confirm that you would like for us to in fact delete your personal information before acting on your request.  With all requests, we will aim to complete requests as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with any timeframes mandated by applicable laws. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. You may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, or designate an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf through these means.
In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process Personal Information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.);
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;
Comply with a legal obligation; or
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
B. Virginia
The Virginia Consumer Data Privacy Act (“VCDPA”), provides Virginia residents with certain additional privacy rights regarding the collection, use and sharing of Personal Information. Sections 2-5 of this Privacy Policy serves as notice of the categories of Personal Information we may collect about you, our processing purposes, and provides detail about how we may disclose your Personal Information to others such as Service Providers.
Fullstory does not sell certain Personal Information as described above. Fullstory does not engage in profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. Fullstory does engage in “targeted advertising” as that term is defined in VCDPA.
Privacy Rights for Virginians

Right to Delete Your Data.
You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
Right of correction
. You have the right to request correction or changes of your Personal Information if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date.
Right to Data Portability.

Please be aware that once if video is posted on our social media accounts, the video will no longer be under SimpliSafe’s full control and could be shared by others, therefore we may not be able to remove the video fully once it has been interacted with, other than by taking the video down on our own social media accounts.
Please note that where your video contains footage of any other individuals, uploading information about other individuals may impinge on their privacy and data protection rights. You are responsible for ensuring that you have obtained the necessary permissions from those individuals before sharing those videos with SimpliSafe.
Personal Information Collected through a Security Camera or other device
When you enable recording or streaming features of a security camera or other recording device (“
Device
”), we will record, stream, store, transmit and process (together “
Record
”) video and/or audio recordings from the Device in the manner required to provide our services. What is recorded and when will depend on how you place the Device and configure its settings. Our services may include capturing, analysing and making available to you and our Monitoring Services provider portions of the Recorded data as part of a notification or analysis of the data to identify motion, intrusion, fire or other events. We process and store information recorded in this way from your Device (“
Monitoring Data
”) so that we can send you alerts when there is an event or make other responses in accordance with any Monitoring Service that we provide to you. This may involve passing Monitoring Data to our response service provider and/or law enforcement and/or other emergency response authorities. You are solely responsible for placement of the Device which will determine what it can and cannot Record and for turning the device on and off. If you have any recording feature enabled during your Device subscription period we will capture, process, and store video and audio recordings from your security camera for 30 days from the date such data is first recorded and stored on our systems. During your subscription period, you will be able to access those recordings for up to 30 days from this date.

NOTE: You acknowledge and agree that privacy and other laws are likely to apply to your use of the Device. You (and not SimpliSafe) will be the controller of all personal data recorded by the Device and you are solely responsible for ensuring that the Recording complies with all applicable laws relating to the Device. For example, you may be required to display a notice (even inside your home) that alerts visitors to your Premises that you are using a security camera that is recording audio and/or video. Privacy laws may also require that you locate the Device so that it can only record activity within the boundary of your Premises and not, for example a neighbouring property, home or garden, shared spaces or a public place not in the boundaries of your commercial Premise, such as a footpath, park, or street. Some countries have laws that prevent recording of conversations without consent or recording of people in areas where they have an expectation of privacy. Please also consider that recording and sharing of video that involves other people may affect their privacy rights. You should refer to publicly available materials to understand your obligations relating to the use of security cameras and recording devices, including those provided by the UK Office of the Information Commissioner at
www.ico.org.uk
. We may provide further information and alerts with the device or on the Site from time to time. You should read these carefully.

8. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We use commercially reasonable physical, technical and administrative security measures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails and other communications you send to us through our Site are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.
9. DATA RETENTION
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We will keep some of your personal data for the time during which your account is open (or, if you do not have an account, for a reasonable period) or, if longer, the period required by law. We retain camera footage internally for 30 days.
To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you are no longer a customer we will retain and securely destroy your personal information in accordance with our policies and applicable law.
