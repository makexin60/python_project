If the User accepts this agreement and pays the relevant fees, then the Provider gives to the User the right to use Bright software products in the way described in this agreement, and in accordance with any service announcements, administrative messages, sales support literature, and other information from the Provider. The User must not use Bright software products in any other way.
The User shall only use Bright software products for internal business management Health and Safety, HR and payroll purposes, and shall input its own employee data information in order to assist it in managing that information. It is also authorised to allow its own employees, or Delegated Users, to input their own information.
Bright software products enables the User to submit content which is then stored in a document library. Such content will, generally, comprise employee data information, and will include such matters as their forename, surname, start date, salary, bank details (for payment of salary) and job title. The User retains ownership of any Intellectual Property Rights that it holds in that content. However, access to this information is dependent upon the User complying with these terms and conditions, and ensuring that the applicable fee has been paid in full. The Provider will use all reasonable endeavours to implement technical and appropriate security measures to protect the information from loss or damage.
The User cannot transfer its rights under this agreement to use Bright software products (or any of the Services) to any other person or organisation.
The User must comply with all applicable laws in respect of its use of Bright software products, and the User must also ensure that the content of any data, however inputted into Bright software products does not, and will not, result in any injury, damage or harm to the Provider or any third party (including, without limitation, defamation or breach of confidentiality). Such content must not contain anything which is unlawful, obscene, indecent or immoral or which promotes or condones any illegal or unlawful activities. It is also a condition of use that the User does not upload content (for example music or videos) for which it does not hold the copyright.
The User acknowledges that although the Provider forms part of a group of companies whose core business is the offering of professional HR, Health and Safety and payroll advice Bright software products are not a substitute for seeking any employment law advice, health and safety advice, payroll advice or tax advice.
The User may purchase or subscribe to third party complimentary products or software services that integrate or work with Bright software products (“Additional Services”). It is The User’s responsibility to decide whether or not to access and use the Additional Services, and if the User chooses to do so, it must agree to the separate applicable terms and conditions presented to it by the Provider, or the third party, for those Additional Services. If the User utilises Additional Services, the User may permit access, via delegation, to individuals for the purpose of lawful, legitimate use of the Services and software. If there is a conflict between any of the terms of this agreement and the Additional Services terms, then the Additional Services terms will prevail in relation to the User’s use of the Additional Services. The Provider is not responsible for any issue with any third-party technology, authorised delegation, information and/or services and will not be liable for those issues. The Provider may withdraw access to such third party technology, delegation, information or services via Bright software products at any time and without notifying the User.
If the User is an ‘individual’ within the meaning of the Consumer Credit Act 2006 then they are entitled to a ‘cooling off’ period. A User falls within the definition of an ‘individual’ and is thereby entitled to a ‘cooling off’ period, if they are (1) a natural person ( i.e an individual) (2) a partnership consisting of two or three persons not all of whom are bodies corporate or (3) an unincorporated body of persons which does not consist entirely of bodies corporate and is not a partnership. The ‘cooling off’ period will entitle such a User to cancel their use of Bright software products and release them from any obligation to pay a fee, provided such notification is received by the Provider within 14 working days from when they accept the terms of this agreement and become a User. In those circumstances the User may become liable to pay the Provider a fee for the Services used, such fee to be agreed between the Provider and the User or accepted by the User at the point of purchase.

5.(c) Setting up a Bright software products account on the basis of a free Lite Product agreement:
