A. Information We Collect.
We may collect the following types of information when you use the Platform.
Information you provide.
When you sign up for the Platform, we ask you for some basic personal information, such as your name, email address, and Academic Institution. You may update or change your account or profile information through the Platform at any time. When you use the Platform, you may provide additional personal information at your sole discretion, including subject interests and grade level interests. As part of an Academic Institution, others in your Academic Institution and linked Academic Institutions may see your personal information and technology reviews.
If you are a Technology Provider, we may collect information from you concerning your Educational Tools. Any information you provide concerning the Educational Tools may be shared with other users of the Platform.
Cookies and Other Similar Technologies.
We use cookies to help us understand how individuals utilize our Platform and to help us improve the quality of our Platform, including for storing user preferences, improving search results, and tracking user trends, such as how individuals use our Platform.
When you access the Platform we automatically record certain information, such as your web request, your interaction with the Platform, IP address, browser type, browser language, device type, operating system, and device ID. We use this information for troubleshooting and security monitoring.
As you interact with the Platform, we obtain information regarding your interactions, such as time of day and date, how long you spend on different pages; some of this information is collected via cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. We use this information to understand how your hardware and software interacts with the Platform and how we can better improve usage of the Platform.
If you or your Academic Institution have installed our extensions to your browser, we may automatically record certain information while the extension is activated, such as your username, the websites you visit, and the amount of time spent on each site. The extension records only application or website information on products that are included in the Platform’s product library as described below.
User Communications.
When you send communications to us or to other users through the Platform, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Platform. We may use your email address to communicate with you about our Platform, including service-related notices.
B. Integrated Metrics Producing Analytics on Classroom Technology (IMPACT) Data
This section applies only if your Academic Institution uses IMPACT. The IMPACT module of the Platform (“
IMPACT
”) is an optional tool that integrates data from multiple sources including student demographic information, product usage, and student achievement data to produce evidence-based reports and dashboards on product effectiveness. The data used in IMPACT are defined, approved, and controlled by the Academic Institution using IMPACT, and usage of IMPACT only happens at the direct instruction of -- and via direct involvement with -- the Academic Institution. IMPACT does not use any data collected via browser extensions. All data used for IMPACT are used only for the specific educational purpose defined by the Academic Institution.
C. How We Use and Share Information
We use information we collect to administer the Platform, to allow you and other users to use the Platform and to improve our Platform and as otherwise described above in Section 10.A. We will disclose information to our service providers that work on our behalf as described in Section 4.A., to provide the Platform.
Certain information and the reviews that you post to the Platform will be shared through the Platform and will be accessible to other users of the Platform. Please note once you have posted information to the Platform or communicated with another member of the Platform, we cannot control how other users may use the information you provide. Additionally, your Academic Institution may have access to your information, including as posted to the Platform, and may use such information in accordance with the Academic Institution policies.
Our Technology Providers do not have access to data you provide us or data we collect unless you expressly initiate such a request or expressly consent to such disclosure. If given permission, our Technology Providers may provide information about their educational tools and respond to requests from users.
If you are a Technology Provider and are using the Platform to respond to a request for proposal ("
RFP
") from an Academic Institution, we may collect the information you submit through the Platform and share that information with the designated Academic Institution.
We may use the information you provide through the Platform in response to RFPs in an aggregate and de-identified manner to provide aggregated and statistical data about such responses to our users and schools.
We may also create aggregated and statistical data about our users and/or Academic Institution and the use of the Platform. We may share or provide aggregated and statistical data, including reviews, to Academic Institutions, educational organizations, or Technology Providers.
We may also use de-identified or aggregated information to improve the Platform, including by sharing such information with our third-party collaborators and partners.
D. Platform Extensions
If you use the browser extension portion of our Platform, the Platform will collect information relating to your use and interactions with various websites accessed through your Chrome browser or your iOS device. Because the explicit purpose of the extensions is to help our customers understand how educational tools are used in their environments, the extensions collect general information only when you use sites related to educational tools that are listed on the Platform and included in the product library. You can review whether the extension is collecting information as follows:
Chrome Extension:
When the Chrome extension is grayed out in your browser, no information is being sent to the Platform. When the Chrome extension is colorized, you are on a website that is part of the product library, and general information is sent back to the Platform.
iOS Extension:
When you are on an application or website that is not part of the Platform product library, no information is being sent to the Platform from the iOS extension.
The information collected through the extensions is not used to identify an individual student and is used only in aggregated form. For Academic Institutions that have a paid subscription to the Platform, the names of individual teachers can be listed on a per Academic Institution basis. We do not otherwise track or collect personal information about your online activities once you leave the Platform.

You may update or change your account or profile information through the Platform at any time. When you use the Platform, you may provide additional personal information at your sole discretion, including subject interests and grade level interests. As part of an Academic Institution, others in your Academic Institution and linked Academic Institutions may see your personal information and technology reviews.
If you are a Technology Provider, we may collect information from you concerning your Educational Tools. Any information you provide concerning the Educational Tools may be shared with other users of the Platform.
Cookies and Other Similar Technologies.
We use cookies to help us understand how individuals utilize our Platform and to help us improve the quality of our Platform, including for storing user preferences, improving search results, and tracking user trends, such as how individuals use our Platform.
When you access the Platform we automatically record certain information, such as your web request, your interaction with the Platform, IP address, browser type, browser language, device type, operating system, and device ID. We use this information for troubleshooting and security monitoring.
As you interact with the Platform, we obtain information regarding your interactions, such as time of day and date, how long you spend on different pages; some of this information is collected via cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. We use this information to understand how your hardware and software interacts with the Platform and how we can better improve usage of the Platform.
If you or your Academic Institution have installed our extensions to your browser, we may automatically record certain information while the extension is activated, such as your username, the websites you visit, and the amount of time spent on each site. The extension records only application or website information on products that are included in the Platform’s product library as described below.
User Communications.
When you send communications to us or to other users through the Platform, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Platform. We may use your email address to communicate with you about our Platform, including service-related notices.
B. Integrated Metrics Producing Analytics on Classroom Technology (IMPACT) Data
This section applies only if your Academic Institution uses IMPACT. The IMPACT module of the Platform (“
IMPACT
”) is an optional tool that integrates data from multiple sources including student demographic information, product usage, and student achievement data to produce evidence-based reports and dashboards on product effectiveness. The data used in IMPACT are defined, approved, and controlled by the Academic Institution using IMPACT, and usage of IMPACT only happens at the direct instruction of -- and via direct involvement with -- the Academic Institution. IMPACT does not use any data collected via browser extensions. All data used for IMPACT are used only for the specific educational purpose defined by the Academic Institution.
C. How We Use and Share Information
We use information we collect to administer the Platform, to allow you and other users to use the Platform and to improve our Platform and as otherwise described above in Section 10.A. We will disclose information to our service providers that work on our behalf as described in Section 4.A., to provide the Platform.
Certain information and the reviews that you post to the Platform will be shared through the Platform and will be accessible to other users of the Platform. Please note once you have posted information to the Platform or communicated with another member of the Platform, we cannot control how other users may use the information you provide. Additionally, your Academic Institution may have access to your information, including as posted to the Platform, and may use such information in accordance with the Academic Institution policies.
Our Technology Providers do not have access to data you provide us or data we collect unless you expressly initiate such a request or expressly consent to such disclosure. If given permission, our Technology Providers may provide information about their educational tools and respond to requests from users.
If you are a Technology Provider and are using the Platform to respond to a request for proposal ("
RFP
") from an Academic Institution, we may collect the information you submit through the Platform and share that information with the designated Academic Institution.
We may use the information you provide through the Platform in response to RFPs in an aggregate and de-identified manner to provide aggregated and statistical data about such responses to our users and schools.
We may also create aggregated and statistical data about our users and/or Academic Institution and the use of the Platform. We may share or provide aggregated and statistical data, including reviews, to Academic Institutions, educational organizations, or Technology Providers.
We may also use de-identified or aggregated information to improve the Platform, including by sharing such information with our third-party collaborators and partners.
D. Platform Extensions
If you use the browser extension portion of our Platform, the Platform will collect information relating to your use and interactions with various websites accessed through your Chrome browser or your iOS device. Because the explicit purpose of the extensions is to help our customers understand how educational tools are used in their environments, the extensions collect general information only when you use sites related to educational tools that are listed on the Platform and included in the product library. You can review whether the extension is collecting information as follows:
Chrome Extension:
When the Chrome extension is grayed out in your browser, no information is being sent to the Platform. When the Chrome extension is colorized, you are on a website that is part of the product library, and general information is sent back to the Platform.
iOS Extension:
When you are on an application or website that is not part of the Platform product library, no information is being sent to the Platform from the iOS extension.
The information collected through the extensions is not used to identify an individual student and is used only in aggregated form. For Academic Institutions that have a paid subscription to the Platform, the names of individual teachers can be listed on a per Academic Institution basis. We do not otherwise track or collect personal information about your online activities once you leave the Platform.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup

To meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
Examples of processing activities:
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process.
Legal obligations sometimes require us to retain certain information for purposes like financial record-keeping, such as information about a payment you’ve made to Google for tax or accounting purposes.
Various laws and regulations require us to put in place measures to confirm that our users are old enough to use our services. To help determine your age, we process the date of birth you provide. We also process information about your activity in our services, both when you’re signed in to a Google Account or signed out, and use machine learning technology to determine if you are likely over 18. In certain cases, if we cannot confirm that you are old enough to use our services by other means, we can request other information to verify your age, like your government ID, credit card, a photo of you, or your phone number.
The information processed will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
Things you create or provide to us
:
Content you create, upload, or receive (like photos, videos, emails, docs and spreadsheets).

My Activity
.
Location information
, such as may be determined by GPS, IP address, and other data from sensors on or around your device, depending in part on your device and account settings.
Information from publicly accessible sources
, such as information that’s publicly available online (like if your name appears in a local newspaper article) or from other public sources.
Information from our trusted partners
, such as from directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, or security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.
The legal grounds for processing this information will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
When necessary for our
legitimate interests
and those of third parties, including to:
Enforce legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service.
For example, analyzing content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our services.
For example, collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public, including disclosing information to government authorities.
For example, responding to legal process or enforceable requests from governments and courts to disclose data, after carefully reviewing each request to make sure it satisfies applicable laws.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device

For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Instructure COPPA Privacy | Policy
Effective Date:
April 01, 2021
Instructure, Inc. (“
Instructure
”) values the privacy of children. This COPPA Privacy Policy (“
COPPA Policy
”) serves as our online notice under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and contains important information about how we collect, use, and disclose the personal information we collect about Children who use our Services (defined below) that are directed to Children. In this policy, “
Child
” or “
Children
” means a user under 13 years old. This COPPA Policy also explains how a parent or guardian (“
parent
” or “
you
”) can restrict the collection, use and/or disclosure of your Child’s information and how you can request deletion of your Child’s information.
Instructure’s Services
This COPPA Policy applies to Child users of Canvas, a learning management system that schools, including administrators and teacher end users (collectively, “

What Information Do We Collect About Children?
How Information is Collected.
We may collect information about Children
directly
from Children and/or their Schools, as well as
automatically
through a Child's use of our Services. We will not require a School or Child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use our Services.
Information We Collect Directly.
We may collect a Child’s name and other personal information when a School provides it to us. For example, through our Services, Schools can create assessments and track their Students’ learning progress. In doing so, Schools may require the Child’s personal information in order to track and archive evidence of learning. Schools decide how they will use our Services and Schools are responsible for ensuring that their collection and use of personal information from Children through the Services complies with applicable laws. If you are a parent and you have questions about your Child's School’s use of our Services, you should discuss your questions with your Child’s School.
Schools also have the option of creating accounts for their Students which allows those Students to view their learning progress and access learning resources provided by their School. If a School chooses to register a Child for an account, Canvas will generate a username and temporary password and provide them directly to the School which may then share them with the Child. After logging in, the Child can then create a permanent password for their account.
Once an account is created, we collect information about Children’s performance and activities on our Services. We may use deidentified or aggregated data in order to improve our services.
Parents can tell us to stop collecting personal information from their Children; however, in such cases the Children will not be able to use our Services. If you direct us to stop collecting and using your Child's personal information, we will notify the School of your request and disable your Child’s use of our Services.
Information We Collect Automatically.
We may automatically collect information about a Child’s use of our Services through our servers and in log files, such as the following: domain name; browser type and operating system; web pages viewed; links clicked; the length of time spent on our Services; the length of time our Services are used; the referring URL, or the webpage that led a user to our Site; language information; device name and model; operating system type, name, and version; and activities within our Services. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Services, gather demographic information about our user base, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. Except as noted in this COPPA Policy, we do not link this automatically collected data to a Child’s personal information.
We may also collect IP address, device identifier or a similar unique identifier from Child users of our Services; we use such identifiers solely to support the internal operations of our Services in the same manner as described above, including to maintain or analyze their functioning; perform network communications; authenticate users or personalize content; and protect the security or integrity of users and our Services. We never use unique identifiers to track Child users across third-party apps or websites.
We may also collect information from any mobile devices that a Child uses if the Child has downloaded one or more of our Apps to their device. This information is used to help us deliver the Services to the Child. Examples of information that may be collected and used include how the Child uses the App(s) and information about the type of device the Child is using. In addition, in the event our App(s) crash on a mobile device, we will receive information about the mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App(s). This crash information is sent to us as aggregated information that does not identify an individual.
How We Use Children’s Information
We use personal information about Children to provide the Services. We do not use personal information about Children for our own commercial purposes.
For the Services.
We use the personal information that we collect about Children for the following general purposes:
To provide our Services;
To respond to customer service and technical support issues and requests;
To identify the Child as a user in our system;
To improve our Services; and
To tailor the content and information that we may display to Children, to offer personalized help and instructions, or to otherwise personalize a Child’s experiences while using the Services.
As Requested by Schools.
When a School provides a Child’s name and other personal information, we use that personal information for the following additional purposes:
To provide Children and Schools with information and reports about a Child’s performance and use of the Services; and
If requested, to facilitate creation of a Child’s account.
Aggregate or De-identified Information.
We may use aggregate or de-identified information about Children for research, analysis, and similar purposes. When we do so, we strip out names, email, contact information, and other personal identifiers. For example, we may use aggregate or de-identified information for one or more of the following purposes, among other purposes:
To better understand how users access and use our Services;
To improve our Services and respond to user desires and preferences; and
For other research and analytical purposes.
How We Share Children’s Information
We do not sell personal information about Children, and there is no means for a Child to make his or her personal information public through our Services (though Schools may choose to share a Child’s information and responses with the Child’s classmates or with other teachers). We will disclose the personal information that we collect about Children only as follows:
Parents, Teachers and Classmates.
We will disclose Children’s personal information: (1) to each Child’s individual teacher(s) and parent(s); and (2) as directed by the Child’s School. Parents may request information about the information we have collected from their Child(ren) by contacting us atprivacy@instructure.com.
Third-Party Service Providers.
We may disclose a Child’s personal information to third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf and/or on behalf of a School or district customer in order to: provide the Child and the Child’s School with the Services that we offer through our Services; conduct quality assurance testing; facilitate creation of accounts; provide technical support; and/or provide other services to us. These third-party service providers are permitted to use personal information only to provide the services requested by Instructure or the School or district customer.
Business Transfers.
If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if all or a portion of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the personal information we have collected about Children to the other company. We will notify all users of any material change in our information practices, as well as any choices users may have regarding their personal information.
In Response to Legal Process.
We may disclose personal information that we have collected from Children in order to comply with applicable law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process.
To Protect Us and Others.
We may disclose personal information that we have collected from Children where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service or our policies including this COPPA Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which Instructure is involved.
Disclosure to Other Third Parties Only with Consent.
Beyond the disclosures described in this COPPA Privacy Policy, Instructure will disclose a Child’s information to any other third party only at a School’s direction.
Our Use of Cookies
We use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal information about a Child’s use of our Services. “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to a computer’s hard drive through a web browser for record-keeping purposes. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once a user closes a web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on a computer until a user deletes them). Some Cookies make it easier for a Child to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track a Child’s activities on our Services for operational purposes.
Third-Party Analytics.
We may also use third-party analytics tools and technologies, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze data from our Site, Apps, or Services. These tools use Cookies and similar technologies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the data collected by such third-party analytics tools only to help us administer and improve the quality of our Site, Apps, and Services and to analyze Site and Apps usage. These third parties are not permitted to use the information collected on our Services, except to help us conduct and improve our business.

Schools may provide Children with links to third-party educational and learning resources located on third-party websites or apps, through our Services. Any access to and use of such linked websites and apps is not governed by this COPPA Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites and apps. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites and apps.
Rights to Review, Delete, and Control Our Use of Children’s Personal Information
Parents and Schools have a right to review and correct the information we have collected about their Child(ren) and Students, respectively, and to delete it, and to tell us to update it or stop using it. To exercise these rights, you may contact us atprivacy@instructure.com. You will be required to authenticate yourself as the Child's parent or School to receive information about that Child. Please note that we cannot delete copies of information that a Child's School has already collected and/or copied, and copies of information that you have deleted may remain in archives for a period of time.

RIGHTS.
You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you. You have the right to request that we rectify or erase your personal data. You also have the right to request that we restrict or block the processing of your personal data. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to receive personal data about you that we store and transmit to another without hindrance from us, including requesting that we provide your personal data directly to another, i.e., a right to data portability; and where we previously obtained your consent, to withdraw consent to processing your personal data.

Please be aware that Instructure may be unable to afford these rights to you under certain circumstances, such as if we are legally prevented from doing so. Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us. To do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.
RETENTION.
We will process and store your personal data only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage, or as permitted by law. The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period or for certain marking data for our services or other products. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or the initiation of a contract.
TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA.
Please be aware that the personal data we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location, including the United States.
When transferring personal data to countries outside the EEA or the UK, we are required to ensure your personal data is adequately protected in the country where it is transferred. We transfer personal data to these countries only when it is subject to safeguards that assure the protection of personal data, such as entering contracts with transferee companies called the “standard contractual clauses” and the “UK addendum,” which require companies outside the EEA or UK to protect your personal data to the same extent as if it had remained in the EEA or UK.
