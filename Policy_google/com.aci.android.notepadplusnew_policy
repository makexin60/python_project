ciapps11@gmail.com. If we have collected and process certain types of personal information with your consent, you may withdraw that consent in the manner described when you provided consent.

Data Retention

When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information or a legal obligation to retain it, we will either delete or anonymize that information or, if this is not possible (for example, because it has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store that information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Some of the safeguards we use include firewalls and data encryption. Personal information is stored in secure operating environments, and only those at ACI APPS with a legitimate business need to do so may access your personal information. We also take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer information will provide protections appropriate to that type of information.

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA Players Only)
If you are from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the type of information and the context in which we collect it.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need it to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If you have questions about the legal basis on which we collect and use your information, please contact us.
