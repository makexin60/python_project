SECURITY OF COLLECTED INFORMATION

Within our company, access to data is secured through a private user ID and password known only to personnel who have a need to know such information to perform their essential job functions. All employees of 'Angels X' are legally bound by a nondisclosure agreement that prevents the disclosure of any corporate or customer information to other parties.

SHARING INFORMATION
We share customer information only as described below, and with subsidiaries of 'Angels X' that follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.
Third Party Service Providers:

Those third parties have access to your information only as necessary to perform their functions, and for no other purposes.
Business Transfers:
As 'Angels X' continues to grow, we might sell or buy certain subsidiaries and/or business units. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred assets, but would remain subject to the protections described in this Privacy Policy (unless you consent otherwise).

We may also disclose your information if there is a violation of the terms of useÂ or other agreements; if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it; or if needed to protect the rights, property or safety of 'Angels X', our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
With Your Consent:
Apart from what is described above, you will receive notice when information about you might otherwise go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share that information.
