Last Updated: November 12, 2024
Introduction
TonalEnergy, Inc. (“TonalEnergy,” “we,” “our” or “us”) respects the privacy of all of its users and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.
This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you, your child, or that you or your child may provide when you visit the website https://tonalenergy.com/ (our “Website”) and the TonalEnergy family of iOS and Android Applications, including the TonalEnergy Tuner (collectively, our “Applications”, together with our Website, our “Platforms”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information, with a focus on information that would be considered “personal data” within the meaning of the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (“TDPSA”) and, in some instances, information that is subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA”).
This policy applies to information we collect:
In accessing and using the Platforms.
In registering to use and to create an account for the Platforms.
In email, text, and other electronic messages between you and the Platforms, including on our chat rooms, message boards, forums, bulletin boards or other interactive features.
It does not apply to information collected by:
Us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by us or any third party; or
Any third party, including through any third-party application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from the Platforms.
For the purposes of the GDPR, TonalEnergy is considered the data controller. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we use the information that we hold. The GDPR applies to you if you reside in the European Economic Area (an “EEA Resident”).
Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Platforms. By accessing or using our Platforms, you agree to this privacy policy, subject to any rights or restrictions that might apply under the GDPR if you are an EEA Resident, including the rights described in the European Privacy Rights for EEA Residents provisions below. This privacy policy is incorporated by reference into the Terms of Use that govern your use of our Platforms (the “Terms”). This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of our Platforms after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
Children Under the Age of 13
We will handle all children’s personal data as described in COPPA and this privacy policy. Our Platforms are intended for users over the age of 13 and users under the age of 13 that receive verified parental, legal guardian, or teacher (as permitted by law) consent to access and use our Platforms. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on our Platforms or through any of its features, register on the Platforms, make any purchases through the Platforms, use any of the interactive or public comment features of the Platforms, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use without prior parental consent.
It is our policy to prohibit collection of personal data from children under 13 unless and until we receive verified parental consent from the child’s parent or legal guardian or from teachers, as permitted by law. To provide consent, you must print out the
Verifiable Parental Consent Form
, complete and sign it, and return it to us by scanning or photographing the completed form and email it to us at support@tonalenergy.com.
The signed and returned form constitutes your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your child’s personal data as described in this policy. If we do not receive your consent or your child’s teacher, your child will not be able to use the Platform, and we will delete your information from our records.
As a parent or legal guardian of a child under 13, you have the ability to request information from us regarding the type of data being collected, view your child’s information and online activity, delete your child’s personal data, and, if you choose, request that we stop making further use of your child’s information.
If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us immediately using the contact information provided below so that we can delete such information.

GDPR and the laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal bases that they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent that those laws apply, we rely on the following legal grounds to process your personal data:
Performance of a contract: In most cases, we collect and use your personal data and other information to meet our obligations under a contract to which you are a party or pursuant to which we are providing services to you.
Legitimate interests: We may use your personal data information for our legitimate interests on the grounds that it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities (but only to the extent that such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals) including:
Analyzing and improving the Platforms and our business.
Providing the services in connection with the Platforms.
Marketing.
Legal compliance: We may use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations under European or Member State law or other applicable law.

In addition to these policies, if you are a Texas resident, you are protected by the Texas Data
Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), and you have certain rights which may be exercised free of charge up to two times per year, provided that in cases where the requests are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, we may charge a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to comply with the request.

European Privacy Rights for EEA Residents
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your personal data) if we intend to use your personal data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your personal data to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your personal data. You can also exercise the right by contacting us directly.

Restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information except to the extent that processing is required (i) to comply with a legal obligation under European Member State law or applicable law or (ii) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Transfer your personal data to a third party to the extent that this is technically feasible.
Honor a revocation of your consent for the processing of your personal data (without retroactive effect).
We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period required by applicable law.

We may request you provide us with additional information to confirm your identity before responding to your request. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the authorities applicable to your situation, though we invite you to contact us with any concern, as we would be happy to try to resolve it directly.
If you are an EEA Resident in France, you also have the right to set guidelines for the retention and communication of your personal data after your death.
In addition, where you believe that we have not complied with its obligation under this Privacy Policy or European law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority, such as the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. You can find a list of local data protection authorities in EEA countries at the following link: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en

Storage of Your Personal Data
We may store any data or other information that we collect (personal or otherwise) ourselves or in databases and servers owned and maintained by us, our affiliates, agents. If you access or use the Platforms outside of the United States, information that we collect about you may be transferred to servers inside the United States and maintained indefinitely, which may involve the transfer of information out of countries located in the European Economic Area and other parts of the world unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law or agreed by us and you. By allowing us to collect information about you, you consent to such transfer and processing of such information without restriction. We may also store some information locally on your computer or other devices. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the Platform and view content faster.
We will only retain your personal data, in a form which permits us to identify you, for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. We will retain and use your personal data as necessary to satisfy any legal, accounting or reporting requirements, to resolve disputes or to enforce our agreements and rights. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.
Data Security
We understand that the security of your personal data is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal data.  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Platforms. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Platforms.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Platforms, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Platforms like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Platforms.

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated on the Platform’s home page for at least 30 days. If we make changes to how we treat our users’ personal data that are materially less protective than provided in this policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you by e-mail to the e-mail address specified in your account and/or through a notice on the Platform home page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Platforms and this privacy policy to check for any changes.  Like our Terms, of which this privacy policy is a part, your use, and/or continued use means that you agree to be bound by such changes.
