This is a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, Barrow St, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter “
Google
“).
Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your device, to help the services analyse how users use them. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the services is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

The IP address transmitted by your app as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
We would like to point out that the code “gat.anonymizeIp();” has already been added to Google Analytics on the services in order to ensure that IP addresses are only recorded anonymously (so-called IP masking).
We also use Google Analytics to analyse data from ads and the Double-Click-Cookie for statistical purposes.
Further information on data protection at Google can be found at
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de

You can revoke your consent at any time via the cookie settings on the services. However, we draw your attention to the fact that we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use all the functions of the services without restriction or at all if you do not give or revoke your consent to the use of Google Analytics.

For children und the age of 13 in the U.S. and under the age of 16 in other countries, the settings in Google AdSense are set to only show non-personalized ads. That means, that their user behaviour and data is not sent to Google. The ad settings in our app are set to
General Audiences

This data helps us to avoid showing you an ad more than once. Google analyses information on how you interact with an ad (clicks, impression, mouse movements) as well as information on whether an ad has already appeared in your app at an earlier time. Google analyses and evaluates the data on the advertisements displayed and your IP address. Google uses the data primarily to measure the effectiveness of an ad and to improve the advertising offer. This data will not be linked to any personal data that Google may have about you through other Google services
Further information on data protection at Google can be found at
