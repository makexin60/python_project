Provide reports and insights regarding advertising performance.
You have various options to control and restrict how your personal information is used for interest-based advertising:

Ad Interaction:
Some ads may provide a direct option to opt-out of interest-based advertising through an icon displayed on the ad itself.
Online Tools and Preferences:
Manage specific ad preferences through tools like Google's Ads Preferences Manager available at
Google Ads Preferences Manager.
Broader opt-out resources are also available through the Network Advertising Initiative and Your Online Choices websites.
Effectiveness and Limitations:
Opting out does not prevent the display of ads; instead, it makes the ads you see less targeted to your interests.
Opt-outs need to be applied on each browser or device you use, as they are not automatically synchronized across different platforms.
If you reset your browser or use a new device, you may need to opt-out again.
Third-Party Control and Responsibility:
Note that these opt-out tools are managed by third parties, and we do not control or guarantee their effectiveness or compliance.
