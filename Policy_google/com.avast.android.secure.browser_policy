Your privacy is a fundamental human right. We’re committed to protecting it
Our privacy commitment to you
At Avast, our mission is to ensure everyone can be free and safe online. The most important way we do this is by making products that help protect your privacy and security. Privacy is a core value for Avast, and providing you with control over your online privacy is one of our main jobs.
We are also committed to responsible data practices in our business. We operate under world-leading, user-centric privacy and data protection standards — and we apply them to our customers worldwide.
Our privacy values
Our users entrust us with their data in order to enhance online privacy and security. We take this responsibility seriously. To meet our commitment to privacy as a fundamental right, globally, we design and operate our products guided by a set of values which we think of as our
‘privacy rule of THUMB’
.
T
— Transparency
If we need to collect personal data (and we try to avoid it where we can), we’ll explain clearly why and how it will be used.
H
— High Security
Any data we do need to process will be protected by the highest security standards. We’ll also give you the tools to keep your files, data, and browsing habits secure anywhere.
U
— User Control
We want to put you in control of how your data is used, via easy-to-use tools. This goes for your interactions with Avast, as well as with anyone else in the digital world.
M
— Minimization
We’ll only use the minimum amount of data needed for a specific purpose. We won’t collect or store your personal data ‘just in case’ it comes in handy later.
B
— Benefit
When we do collect data, we will use it to benefit you by making  your online experience better, such as by improving our online threat detection and prevention capabilities.

We’ve prepared in-depth articles to arm you with knowledge that can help you further protect your online privacy.

Advocacy for Digital Freedom and Privacy
Avast is committed to contributing its expertise and talent to give back to society. One of the ways we do so is by championing the cause of protecting digital freedom and privacy as a fundamental human right.
We recognize that, while extremely useful, privacy and security technologies will not fully solve privacy problems on a societal level. Strong privacy laws are essential, as is the thoughtful enforcement of such laws. We understand what it means to operate under strong privacy and data protection laws. We therefore advocate and support legal protections for user privacy.
Individuals should have access to information about how to protect their online privacy. Avast aims to utilize the work we do to train our own people and make sure that such educational materials are freely available to all.
We help progress the discussion and development of privacy policies, ideas, and best practices via our participation in and support of forward-thinking groups, such as the Future of Privacy Forum and the International Association of Privacy Professionals.
We will continue to increase our impact on reforming the digital landscape and focus on society-level solutions to privacy, even as we innovate to bring more privacy products to users.
What types of data do we collect, and how do we use them?
Below are the main categories of data that we collect and what we use them for:
Account data helps us manage your account, facilitate your login to the service, and tells us how to reach you. It includes information needed to set up and customize an account, such as your email address and username, and information connected with our services, such as license keys. Some products, such as free antivirus, do not require setting up an Avast account.
Product data helps us get smarter about how to keep you safe. This includes:
Device data
information about the operating system and hardware you use: device location, error logs, browser, network, and applications running on your device, including Avast products.
Service data
about product performance on your device, which tells us how to keep you safe and how to optimize your device’s performance. This data includes malware samples and detections, information concerning website URLs, usage statistics (activation, crashes, scans, errors), and your IP address.
Billing data includes your name, email address, masked credit card number, license information, and in certain circumstances, your billing address, payment method for auto-renewal, and your phone number. We use it to send you purchase receipts, process payment and billing records, and to check for renewal, validity, and customer support. Billing data is collected only for paid apps.
For a complete list of the types of data we process and the purposes we use them for, you can check out our
Privacy Policy
.
How does data enable safety and security online?
Cybersecurity expertise
When you use our security products and participate in our security community by choosing to share certain data from your devices, you contribute directly to our ability to identify and neutralize potential threats to you and your devices. With hundreds of millions of users working together, we’re able to get a clear global view of cybersecurity threats as they develop, which greatly improves our ability to combat them. This enables us to deliver better protection to you, faster.
Next generation AI technology
Each month, Avast stops 1.5 billion attacks globally. One way we’re able to do this is by utilizing advanced AI algorithms to learn how a user’s device was attacked, where the attack originated, and any indications as to the purpose of the attack. This in turn allows us to detect threat patterns and security issues from that same data in ways that are impossible for humans.
Giving you control of your digital identity
Today’s online world requires us to share our personal information and private data with countless websites, apps, and digital services.
Avast believes that everybody should have confidence that their online identity is safe and secure. We build services that help you take control of your digital identity, so that it’s you, not big tech companies, that decides how your personal information is shared.
Discover how Avast is putting digital identity services at the heart of our mission to protect your digital freedom.

Products that put you in charge of your privacy
We build all our products in line with the privacy commitment and principles discussed above. That said, Avast also designs privacy products that specifically empower users to take control over their online privacy, no matter who they’re dealing with online.

In a world where it’s essential to be connected to work, play, and communicate, you shouldn't have to worry about your activity being watched or critical data about your behavior being shared with others.
Whether at home or on public Wi-Fi, Avast SecureLine VPN encrypts your internet connection with the click of a button, securing your connection and preventing employers, advertisers, governments, and internet providers from seeing what you do online.
Avast Secure Browser
Browse faster, safer, and without ads or trackers
We live in a connected world. Whether banking, working, shopping, or connecting with friends and family, we constantly access and share precious personal data online. That’s why it’s important to choose a browser that puts your privacy first.

Avast Secure Browser includes several layers of privacy protection that mask your digital identity while you browse. This prevents websites from identifying you online and blocks third parties from tracking your data and activity. Secure Browser also gives you a faster browsing experience by automatically blocking ads to improve website load time.
Additionally, built-in security protects your data from hackers, prevents malicious downloads, and ensures websites encrypt your data. We’ll also alert you if your login credentials are ever compromised.
Avast AntiTrack
Disguise your online identity with AntiTrack
We reveal a lot about ourselves when we’re online and without the right protection, our digital lives can be an open book. Stop online tracking and get advertisers off your back with AntiTrack.

Your online habits can be tracked to create a digital ‘fingerprint’ made up of everything from your search history to the goods you’ve bought and the places you traveled. This highly sensitive information may be sold to third parties who can use it to target you with ads or even raise prices on products they know you will be interested in.
Avast AntiTrack gives you greater online privacy by disguising your digital fingerprint to keep your true identity private and  exposing and blocking attempts to track you.
Avast BreachGuard
Protect your personal information from being exploited online
Everyone who uses the internet risks their personal information being compromised. Avast BreachGuard provides detection, resolution, and ongoing monitoring and prevention to ensure your personal information is safeguarded at all times.

This Privacy Policy was last updated in November 2024.

Please refer to our
Products Policy

Personal Data We Process
Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (“Personal Data”).
We may collect data or ask you to provide certain data when you visit our websites and use our products and services. The sources from which we collect Personal Data include:
Data collected directly from you or your device relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”), and may include direct identifiers such as name, postal and email address, phone number, and online or indirect identifiers such as login account, login password, marketing preferences, social media account, and/or IP address;
If we link other data with your Personal Data, we will treat that linked data as Personal Data; and
We may also collect Personal Data from trusted third-party sources such as service providers, distributors, resellers, app stores, contact centers, and engage third parties such as marketing, survey, analytics or software suppliers to collect Personal Data to assist us.
We do not process special categories of personal data, such as data concerning health, race, ethnicity or political opinions, or deduce in any way this type of information from data we collect within our products.
We organize the Personal Data we process into these basic categories: Billing Data, Account Data, Product Data and Communications Data.
Billing Data
The below described billing process applies to all customers who have purchased our products and/or standalone features through our Gen eStore. This information is used to bill those customers for their services and products.
Our parent company, Gen Digital Inc., will act as a controller with respect to processing of the Billing Data.
Billing data includes your name, email address, billing address, your phone number, payment information (depending on method can include Credit/Debit Card Information or PayPal account), National ID (regional specific, if outside the United States), VAT/Tax ID (regional specific, if outside the United States) and device fingerprint ID.
Billing data
What we use it for
Email address
To send you purchase receipts
Name and Billing address
To maintain billing records
Payment information – payment card info, for businesses only VAT/Tax ID and Business ID
To process the payment and billing records
Identifiers – product and license keys/numbers, Wallet ID, Auto bill ID, Payment transaction ID
To identify the product and enable features based on the purchased license and to track account activity between internal company systems, applications, and architecture. This data is also processed for the purpose of delivering the product in accordance with your device(s) as well as for trade compliance and fraud check.
Renewability
To check if a given subscription can be renewed under the same or similar terms
Expiration date
To check whether a license is current
Device fingerprint ID
To validate that an authenticated payment transaction occurred, and the payment card and account are appropriate for billing.
IP address
To facilitate the enrollment and purchases and detect and prevent fraud.
Relevant subsets of Billing data are kept for 7 years for the purpose of complying with our legal obligations (particularly in the finance and tax area) and defending our rights.
In certain cases, you purchase our products and services from a trusted third-party service provider, reseller, or app store. In those circumstances, your Billing Data is processed by the relevant third party and we only receive a subset of this data to keep proper business records. In particular, we only have a masked credit/debit card number, not your full payment details.
Account Data
Account Data includes information to set up and customize an account, such as your name, email address and username, and information connected with our services, such as product, license and device information. For some of our products or some of their functions creating an account is necessary. Account Data is also used for customer management and engagement, revenue generation, and evaluation and optimization of operational, sales and business processes.
See below an example of Account Data and what we use it for:
Account data

Name

, you have the option to provide additional information within your account such as your name, email address, social media information, birth date, gender, instant messaging information, or website name and address, your physical location, and an avatar or personalized picture. We use Discourse for hosting the Forum.
To register with us or to be able to log in later on our pages or in our products, we offer you, in addition to our own procedure, the option to do this via the services Facebook Connect, Google, and Apple ID. For this purpose, we will redirect you to a page of the corresponding provider. Data from the provider (email, platform ID, optionally name) is then provided to create the account.
The customer account remains valid until you actively delete it in the user administration section of the account. You can also contact our support or DPO in case you would like to delete your account.
Product Data
Product Data includes two sub-categories:
Device Data
includes information about the operating system; hardware; city/country location of device; IP address, device error logs; browser; network; applications running on the device, including the Avast products; and
Service Data
includes information about product usage and events relating to use of our product by you. This information includes security data (samples and detection details such as information concerning URLs of websites, texts, emails and files used for malware and scam protection), usage statistics (activation, crashes, scans, errors), information related to product licenses, support-related data and our internal identifiers associated with our services (e.g. installation ID, internal hardware ID).
These sub-categories differ for each product and service. If you want more detail about Device and Service Data we process on a product basis, please refer to our
Products Policy
.
Communications Data
If you contact us directly, request information or provide reviews and feedback, we collect personal data about you, including identifiers, such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of any message or attachments that you may send or communicate to us, and any other information you choose to provide.

We will also collect identifiers from you, such as your email address and phone number, when you sign up to receive product updates, offers, and other promotional information or messages from us. When we send you emails, we may track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve our services.
Why We Process Your Personal Data

We may also share threat intelligence with other security companies and experts to improve our threat detection models;
To make our systems and applications more secure including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks;
To record our phone conversation when you contact our tech support by phone to better respond to your requests.

To establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights.
Your interests are a key part of our decision-making process and have been considered in all of the above-mentioned processing activities. We believe we have achieved a fair balance between privacy and business operations. In any case, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to those processing operations. For more details, please see section
Your Privacy Rights
.
The list is, however, not exhaustive and depending on the business and legal developments we may process data for other compatible purposes as applicable in accordance with relevant privacy regulations.
Balancing Legitimate Interests
Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough. With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail.
Security and Threat Intelligence
We process Personal Data to support network and information security efforts. In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data in a proportionate manner for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. This covers the ability of our networks or of our information systems to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the data we store or transmit, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.
Moreover, as a member of the security community, we also cooperate with other players across the security landscape, in particular by exchanging threat intelligence resources, and aid in research and development of new security solutions.
The Personal Data we process for the purpose listed above includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:
Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);
Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including phishing);
Email header detail including addresses and intermediary systems (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);
Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files);
Samples (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files);
Samples behavior (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful files);
URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful content); and/or
IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful content).
Product messaging - In-product and Email Messages
We have a legitimate interest in messaging our users about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and about products that supplement or improve the products already purchased. We can also message our customers with information and offers relating to already purchased products (e.g. time-limited offers).
If you are our customer, we feel a responsibility to inform you about security and utility improvements and possible problems to your device and software, and provide you with effective solutions relevant to these problems. Because of this, we have a legitimate interest to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication to you so that you are likely to find them relevant and non-intrusive at the same time. We use certain limited subsets of Billing Data, Account Data, and Product Data to deliver this communication.
Product and business improvement
We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data to understand user conversions, acquisitions and campaign performance through various distribution channels, and users’ download, activation and interactions with our products. For example, we want to know how many users clicked on our offers, or purchased our product after seeing one of our ads. These analytics help us improve functionality, effectiveness, security and reliability of our products and business activities as well as helping us to develop new products. This processing includes using third-party tools. Please refer to our
Products Policy
for the list of third-party tools used for the specific products and services.
How We Process Your Personal Data
We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the Personal Data that we use:
For free versions, this disconnection or removal of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially activated. For paid users we keep Billing Data in a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than handling payments and our own analytical and financial management activities.
For both paid and free versions, we continuously monitor for, minimize, disconnect and remove all direct identifiers during the normal performance of the products and services.
Processing of IP Addresses
Your IP address is collected at the time at which your product or service is being provided for the purpose of downloading and installing the products, product authorization, fraud and malware detection and for the purpose of facilitating our billing process. In particular for delivering the content in accordance with your device(s) settings, determining appropriate language settings for communicating with you, troubleshooting issues, and generating appropriate diagnostics reports.
Please refer to our
Products Policy
for specific use of IP address by our products and services.
Personalization
We use relevant Billing Data, Account Data, Product Data and your answers from surveys, in which you can participate, to personalize our offers, communication and product recommendations.
We do not take any decisions solely based on algorithms, including profiling, that would significantly affect you.
How We Disclose Your Personal Data
We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within our group of companies, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, when required by applicable law. Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and the relevant
Products Policy
sections. If we disclose your Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.
We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer. Data obtained through short code programs will not be shared with any third-parties for their marketing reasons/purposes.
Payment processors
In certain cases we may use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are properly regulated and authorized to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes other than arranging these services for us. However, they are independent controllers of your data with their own responsibility.
These are our long-term payment processors:

Your Billing Data is processed by the payment processor from whom you purchased the product. Your data is processed according to the relevant processor’s terms and privacy policy.
Service Providers
We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and
Products Policy
. We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential.
Such service providers may include contact centers, professional consultants (including to defend or to exercise our rights), and marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers. We may also connect with business partners to provide specific services to you such as identity restoration. To provide identity restoration services, we may share, at your direction, your data with financial institutions, financial services companies, and other authorized third parties.
We use Salesforce to provide us the CRM platform (see their
privacy information
including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers).
We use Qualtrics as the provider of the experience management platform used to collect and evaluate customer feedback and insights (see their
Privacy statement
including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
We use Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc., for hosting our Forum (see their
privacy information
).
Sometimes these service providers, for example- our distributors, resellers, and app store partners- will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”) and privacy statements will apply to such relationships.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Advertising Companies
To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve third-party ads in our products for mobile devices. To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product. The SDK collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you.
Only few of our free products serve third-party ads. You will be asked for consent during the installation process of any such product. For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our
Consent Policy
which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy.
We may share limited categories of personal data (online identifiers and product-related information used to display appropriate ads) with these third parties for cross-contextual advertising purposes, as defined under California and other applicable U.S. state laws. “Cross-contextual advertising” in this context means advertisements we believe will be more interesting and useful to you based on your data, including data related to the use of our Services. Third parties may use the data we’ve shared with them to show you personalized ads. No data is sold to these third parties.
Distributors, Resellers
We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of distribution, sale or management of our products. Our partners may communicate with you about Avast products or services. In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Cookies Providers
Our websites use cookies to personalize your experience on our sites, to tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and to give us insights into user interactions and user base as a whole so we can improve our communications and products. While using our websites, you will be asked to authorize the collection and use of data by cookies according to the terms of the
Cookie Policy
.
Analytics Tool Providers
We use analytical tools, including third-party analytical tools, which allow us, among other things, to identify potential performance or security issues with our products, to improve their stability and function, to understand how you use our products, and websites so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, and to evaluate and improve our campaigns. We use Service and Device data for analytics.
While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise. Below, we list these partners and tools and their privacy policies.

In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law. No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to:
A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;
A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process;
Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or
A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings
Like any other consumer brand, we too go through our own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Our business decisions and market developments therefore affect our structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate.
If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable. Information including personal data relating to our business may be shared with other parties in order to evaluate and conclude the transaction. This would also be the case if we were required by law to make such changes.
Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Group Entities and to Third-Party Vendors
We are a global business that provides products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data processed.
The intra-group transfers within the Gen Digital Group are covered by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. Check
here
to access the Gen Digital Inc. Data Privacy Framework Notice.
At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data originating from the EEA outside of the EEA or cooperate with a third-party vendor located outside the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate safeguards, such as
Standard Contractual Clauses
or
adequacy decisions
adopted by the European Commission, to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.
Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include: allowing access to Personal Data stored in the Google Cloud Platform to Google personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the
Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings
section).
How We Protect Your Personal Data
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data.
Administrative Safeguards
Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave the company. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.
Technical Safeguards
We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize technical safeguards such as up-to-date
firewall
protection for an additional layer of security, high-quality anti-virus software, and we regularly update our
virus
definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to adopt appropriate measures if we deem them necessary.
Physical Safeguards
Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.
Proportionality
We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.
Children’s Privacy
Our websites, services and products are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect data from, minors (as defined by applicable law) except where explicitly described otherwise in the privacy notices of services designed specifically for purposes, such as to assist you by providing child online protection features. In such cases, we will only collect and process Personal Data related to any child under the age specified in particular jurisdictions, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process. Details about this processing is included in our
Products Policy
. Please refer to the specific applicable notices for this information.
How Long We Store Your Personal Data
We keep your personal data as long as we need it to provide you with our services, to comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s legitimate interests (such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products; to defend against legal claims, complaints, litigation or regulatory proceedings). Often, there are different reasons to keep a specific piece of information that overlap and influence each other.
When determining the specific retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of service provided to you, the nature of our relationship with you, and mandatory retention periods provided by law and the relevant statute of limitations.
More specifically, we will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the following periods:
For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights and keeping proper business records. So, if we take payments from you, we archive limited payment information related to transactions for the time specified in law (depending on the relevant jurisdiction) to maintain proper business records, meet our audit obligations, detect and prevent fraud and to protect our legal rights in case there are disputes. We also keep your Billing data to enable the renewal of your subscriptions;
For Account Data, for as long as you maintain your account;
For Product Data, only as long as necessary for the purposes of a particular product or service. Where possible, we use rolling deletion periods which means we regularly delete collected data in the given periods starting from the collection of that respective data. The rolling deletion periods for Product Data are not longer than six years. You can find specific rolling deletion periods for each of our products and their purposes in our
Products Policy
. Please note that when you uninstall our product, processing for service provision, in-product messaging, analytics and third-party ads, if applicable, dependent on the installed product shall cease. After the uninstallation, we will continue to process your Product Data for statistical purposes for up to six years. We have measures in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws, including pseudonymization.
For Communications Data, for as long as necessary to resolve your requests or questions and maintain evidence of such communications to defend our rights and protect our interests. If you receive product updates, offers, and other promotional information or messages, we process the data until you unsubscribe.
Storage of Your Personal Data
We are a global company that processes personal data in many countries. As part of our business, we may transfer data across the Gen group, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and third-party vendors of Gen located worldwide, including Avast, Avira, LifeLock and Norton entities. Data can be located in places where we offer our products or have our offices, infrastructure or data centers, including Europe and the United States.
Transfers of your personal data within Gen Digital and its subsidiaries and affiliates are done pursuant to our intra-group data transfer agreement including EU Commission-approved
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs). At the same time, intra-group transfers within the Gen Digital Group are covered by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. Click
here
to access the Gen Digital Inc. Data Privacy Framework Notice.
Before we transfer data to third parties, we look at the risks to the data associated with such transfer. We require third parties to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly. For data originating from the European Economic Area we rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
.
Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA may also include: allowing access to personal data stored in the cloud (such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform) to personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services.
In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
Your Privacy Rights
There are a variety of data protection laws around the globe that provide privacy rights to you as our customer. You can make certain choices about how your data is used by us by adjusting the privacy settings of the relevant product.
Besides that, you have the following rights (depending on the region):
Right to information - Right to receive information about the processing of your Personal Data, prior to processing as well as during the processing, upon request. In particular, but not limited to:
categories of personal data collected, sold, or disclosed by us;
purposes for which categories of personal data are collected or sold;
categories of sources from which we collect personal data;

Right of access - You have the right to receive a copy of your Personal Data
Right to rectification - You have the right to seek correction of inaccurate Personal Data.
Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") - You have the right to erasure of your Personal Data, but only in specific cases stipulated by law, e.g., if there is no legally recognized title on our part for further processing of your Personal Data (incl. protection of our legitimate interests and rights).
Right to data portability - The right to receive Personal Data which you have provided and is being processed on the basis of consent or where it is necessary for the purpose of conclusion and performance of a contract, in machine-readable format. This right applies exclusively to Personal Data where processing is carried out by automated means.
Right to object - Applies to cases of processing carried out in legitimate interest. You have the right to object to such processing, on grounds relating to your particular situation, and we are required to assess the processing in order to ensure compliance with all legally binding rules and applicable regulations. In case of direct marketing, we shall cease processing Personal Data for such purposes after the objection.
Right to withdraw consent - In the case of processing based on your consent, as specified in our
Consent Policy
, you can withdraw your consent at any time by using the same method (if technically possible) you used to provide it to us (the exact method will be described in more detail with each consent when you provide it). The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.
Right to restriction of processing - You have the right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data if: You are contesting the accuracy of your Personal Data, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of your Personal Data; the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the Personal Data and request the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or you have objected to processing of your Personal Data, and there is a pending verification whether our legitimate grounds override your interests.
Right to Equal Service - Right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights, subject to certain limitations.
Right to contact a supervisory authority or court - You may contact and lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority – The Office for Personal Data Protection (Czech: Úřad na ochranu osobních údajů – www.uoou.cz) or your local authority or a relevant court.
You can submit your requests relating to your data subject rights and access to documentation relating to appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers through our online form:
https://support.avast.com/en-us/contact/dsr
.
The fulfillment of data subject rights listed above will depend on the category of Personal Data and the processing activity. In all cases, we strive to fulfill your request.
We will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a Data Subject. When we are faced with an unusually large number of requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months. If we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to resolve the situation informally.
Where requests we receive are unfounded or excessive, in particular because they repeat, we may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request.
Identification of an individual may not be necessary for some of our free products to be delivered to you or to function. In this case, we do not and will not maintain, acquire or process additional information solely in order to identify the users of our free products and services.
Consistent with our privacy by design, privacy by default and data minimization practices, we may not be able to identify you in connection with Product Data relating to specific free products and services. However, you can go directly to your product settings and explore the available privacy options.

What is a VPN?
Help avoid being hacked on public Wi-Fi, reduce targeted ads, and access your favorite content no matter where you are, with Avast SecureLine VPN.
Who is tracking you online?
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can:
See everything you do online
Sell your medical, financial, and browsing history
Employers can:
Snoop on your online activities
Limit your career opportunities if you transgress company policy
Avast SecureLine VPN helps protect your privacy
Hide your IP address
Your
IP address
is one of the main ways internet service providers, and others, keep track of you online. So don’t give them more than you have to: our servers will be your mask by giving you a new IP Address.
A single shared IP address
It’s easier to get lost in a crowd. Whenever you connect to our servers, you get the same IP address as everyone else connected to it — this makes it that much harder for traffic on that server to be associated with any one of you.
Get DNS leak protection
We make sure that your browsing data is secure against DNS leaks, so your internet service providers
never see your IP Address
or what you’re doing online.
Enjoy no activity logging
Once you’re connected to our servers, we don’t track the apps you use, the websites you visit, or the content you consume.
Smart VPN Mode
Enjoy a seamless browsing experience with no compromise on privacy and security. Smart VPN automatically selects your optimal server location, so you can focus on enjoying your connected life with no hassle.
Make your connection more secure
Help protect yourself against wider network threats,
hackers
, and scammers with just one click. Without a secure, private VPN, your device’s web traffic isn’t private at all. But our bank-grade
encryption
can help safely tunnel your communication through any network.
Bank-grade encryption
Based on open-source technology for Windows and Android
Apple-approved for best compatibility and performance
Protection over public Wi-Fi and unsecured networks
Learn more
A VPN also helps protect you from network threats
With bank-grade encryption, your data is more secure and safer from online scammers and network threats.
Get privacy protection built on transparency
We’ve built your protection on the most widely used and trusted VPN protocol: OpenVPN. It is the most trusted because it’s open source. No unknown proprietary code is doing odd things with your data. We use OpenSSL libraries and run the whole thing over UDP ports so you get the fastest speeds.
Get security you can always trust
We use 256-bit advanced encryption standard (AES). Why? It would take a hypothetical hypercomputer years to crack it. It’s also because there wouldn’t be enough energy in the universe to run this hypothetical computer in the first place. We’re thorough that way.
Apple-approved
Our iOS and macOS implementations use the IPsec protocol, and we’ve built it all on Apple’s proprietary stacks to ensure the best compatibility and performance. Our goal: connecting you at lightning speed.
Get advanced protection against common online scams
It’s not always easy to spot when you’re being tricked or exploited online but Avast SecureLine VPN offers you advanced protection to better avoid these common types of attacks.
Avoid packet sniffing
You’re connected to an open, unprotected network and log into your accounts. But you’re not alone on the network.
When you get a cookie, the intruder gets a cookie — and now they have access to your account.
A single shared IP address
You’re connected to your favorite hip coffee shop Wi-Fi, right?
Are you sure it’s their network? Do they even have Wi-Fi?
Maybe they don’t and you’re now mainlining your data into an attacker’s computer.
Beware the evil twin trick
Your devices just love to auto connect to known networks and save you time.
That’s a pretty risky thing to do.
It’s easy to create a doppelganger network that will fool your phone, computer – or even you.
Help stop man-in-the-middle attacks
Unknown to you, someone inserts themselves between you and the internet.
They can change what you see on your favorite sites, redirect you to fake sites, take over your communications, and steal your accounts and passwords.
Access the content you love, from wherever you are
Enjoy your favorite shows, videos, and websites, from wherever you are, at home or on the go.
Access your favorite sites and videos.
Enjoy peer-to-peer support.
Find better deals when you shop online.

Easily change the location you appear to be connecting from with a click, so you can access your favorite websites, videos, and apps when you’re at home or on the move.

Smart VPN
Enjoy a seamless browsing experience with no compromise on privacy and security. Smart VPN automatically selects your
optimal server location
, so you can focus on enjoying your connected life with no hassle.
Do it all lightning fast
There’s no point in having a secure, private internet connection if it just won’t load. We’re constantly upping the speed and performance of our servers, so you always enjoy the VPN service you expect.
Game or download large files.
Use on up to 10 devices.
Enjoy up to 2 Gbits/s speed.

Where speed meets capacity
Connect more securely with the confidence that your speed and performance won’t be affected — with our network of servers, we can handle almost any capacity.
Enjoy top performance — even at the busiest times
All of our VPN gateways run on dedicated hardware servers and we make sure they have enough excess capacity to maintain performance even under peak loads. We run systems on top of that to balance web traffic, so our servers never become overloaded.
Capacity at scale
Avast SecureLine VPN is currently backed by more than 700 servers — we add more all the time and they’re yet to reach their limits. But if we ever get close, we can quickly extend our capacity by tapping into a trusted network of partners across the world.
Speed under pressure
Each of our servers has a theoretical maximum throughput of 2 Gbit/s. But theory isn’t the real world. We regularly put them through stress tests and get average speeds of 450-600 Mbit/s even under periods of intense loads. And since it’s all running over UDP, it’s always fast enough for whatever you need.
Be more secure on Smart TVs running Android TV
Jump on the couch, put your feet up, and watch your favorite content directly on your Android smart TV, Nvidia Shield TV, or Mi Box.
Enjoy more security for all Android TV devices.
Get more privacy for your big-screen streaming.
