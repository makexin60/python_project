To improve the monetisation of the Games via in-app purchases
We may process information (including Basic Information, Advertising Data and Analytics) to understand how users use our Games, and to compile statistical reports regarding that activity, as well as understanding how users progress, and their current status within a Game.

The information we collect about you may be used to understand how advertisements placed in our Games have performed or how many people have viewed certain advertisements.

Where we process your Submitted Data for serving advertising to you which is untargeted (for example, display advertising which is not tailored to your perceived interests), we do so on the basis of our legitimate interests, being our commercial interests in generating revenues to support our business and our ability to make the Online Services available to you.
We may also use this information to reward users with benefits that can be used for further enjoyment of the Games from the viewing of certain advertising placed in our Games.
We or our trusted partners (including those partners set out in the tables in Clause 4 below) may use the information we collect about you to serve you with more relevant advertisements in our Online Services or on third party services.  We, and our partners and vendors, do this to provide you with more relevant advertising content that we think will be more interesting for you.

Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws or our terms of use, we may use your personal data to inform relevant third parties such as your law enforcement agencies about the content.
We work with Apple and Google to assist us with fraud prevention and the detection of any illegal activity (e.g. to verify in-app purchases made through iTunes and Google Play).
To understand which publisher of our advertisements referred you to us
We process personal data, including without limitation the Basic Information and Analytics, so that we can understand which publisher of our advertisements referred you to us and, for example, to which advertisement and/or advertising or marketing campaign that referral related. This information is helpful for our purposes of understanding which marketing and advertisement activity is successful. We process this personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests, being our interests in promoting and improving our Games and their commercial success (including by improving our advertising and marketing).

About Us
ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“ironSource Mobile”) operates 4 main services:
Ad Network
– A platform that allows app developers to serve ads within their apps, and advertisers to promote their products, and services within apps.
Mediation Platform
– A platform that helps app developers to manage all the ad providers with which they have a direct relationship (e.g. ironSource Mobile ad network, “third party” ad networks, additional online advertising companies, etc.) that serve ads on their apps.
Analytics Platform –
A platform that allows app developers to receive insights on their apps.
Ad Quality Platform
–
A platform that allows app developers to monitor advertising content displayed within their apps.

here
We collect information in either of 2 ways:
Directly
– through our SDKs integrated by app developers in their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information directly from such apps.
Indirectly
– through other third party mediation platforms with which we engage in order to serve ads in apps, or by receiving information from our advertisers, or affiliates.
Scope:
This privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with respect to information it processes through its Ad Network, Mediation Platform, Analytics Platform and Ad Quality Platform. This privacy policy does not govern the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for advertisers.
ironSource Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connetecuit and Utah, please see “State Privacy Rights” section of this privacy policy for information related to privacy laws in these states.
Information We Collect:
Information collected through our Ad Network (“Ad Network Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, and a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”), or . The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising companies to recognize a device across apps, for advertising purposes. You can find additional information about how to limit our use of the Advertising ID under “How to Control Your Information”.
General technical information about a device: Technical information such as the device’s time zone, the amount of free memory on the device, the name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status, operating system name and version,  the language of the operating system, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection type (e.g. WiFi), etc.
Campaign information: An indication if an ad was viewed, or clicked, or if there was an install of an advertised app. Information about actions performed within an advertiser’s app following such an install, such as in-app purchases, and level in the game (if the advertiser chooses to provide such information).
Information collected through our Mediation Platform (“Mediation Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer.
General technical information as described above.
Data provided by the app developers (if they choose to provide it) – The app developer can choose to share with us the following information: age, gender, in-app purchases, advance in the game, and such other information provided by the app developer.

How We Use the Information We Collect:
As stated above, we provide 4 main services. For each such service, we use the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general description of how we use information across our services:
Operating our Ad Network
– We use Ad Network Information to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting, billing and attribution: We use Ad Network Information to generate reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Network Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud detection and prevention: We use Ad Network Information for detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.
Optimization and frequency capping: We use Ad Network Information for optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of ads you view in a specific app.
Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in, or from their advertising campaigns.
Operating our ad marketplace. We use Ad Network Information to allow the third party advertising companies listed

– We use Mediation Information to operate our mediation platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our mediation platform in order to allow them to better understand their audience in terms of interaction with ads.
Segmentation: We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content of the ads served by different networks.
Sending ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network Information.
Operating our Analytics Platform
– We use Analytics Information to operate our Analytics Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Analytics Platform in order to allow them to better understand the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Analytics Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Operating our Ad Quality Platform
– We use Ad Quality Information to operate our Ad Quality Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Ad Quality Platform in order to allow them to see which ads were served within their apps, and how such ads affected the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Quality for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings

cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services

, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “AppLovin”) operates a suite of tools for app developers and other businesses to automate and optimize the marketing and monetization of their platforms, products, or services by enabling the placement of different types of advertisements on digital properties including mobile apps, websites, and connected TV devices (collectively, the “Advertising Services” or “Services”).  As explained below, consumers interact with us in a few ways, primarily through advertisements served by AppLovin on behalf of advertisers.
The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our Services and advertising platform, and our corporate website at www.applovin.com (the “Website”), as well as your choices related to that information.

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.
General Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer who downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services through advertisements served within a digital property, we may collect certain information, including the following:
Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;
Carrier;
Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);
Network connection type and speed;
IP Address;
Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services;
HTTP header information;
Advertising IDs (IDFA/GAID/Amazon FOSAID);
Vendor IDs (IDFV);
App Set IDs; and
Advertising and tracking preferences and restrictions.
Application publishers may choose to share with us additional information including your age or year of birth, gender, email, phone number, and interest segments for purposes of their own direct ad serving.  We do not retain this data or pass it downstream to advertising partners.  Please see the applicable publisher’s privacy policy for more information about their use of first party data.
Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments.

This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data

Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.

AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, AppLovin commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact AppLovin at
dataprotection@applovin.com

On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers, where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
If the processing of your personal data is necessary, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you if there is no other lawful basis for such processing. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of personal data should be sent to us as specified in the “Contact” section below.

Privacy Shield Notice
1. WHO WE ARE
Vungle is an ad network providing a technology platform (“
Platform
”) for Clients that want to advertise and/or monetize their applications, games, and other products. Our “
Clients
” include “
Advertisers
” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Platform, and “
Publishers
” of applications that want to display relevant ads to end users (“
End Users
“) of third party applications (“
apps
“) that use our SDKs, APIs, hosted video advertising platform and/or any of our related advertising tools (collectively, the “
Vungle Ad Services
“).
Advertising revenue helps keep many games and apps free, and Vungle works hard to ensure that our ads are interesting, relevant, and safe for End Users.
2. VUNGLE AD SERVICES
This Section describes how Vungle collects and uses information we receive from End Users (“
you
“) of apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.
2.1 What information do we collect?
When you use an app supported by Vungle technology (see Section 2.3,
below
, our services can collect certain information about your mobile device. Some of this information (including for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be “personal information” or “personal data” as defined under law in some jurisdictions (including in California and the EU, respectively) (hereinafter, collectively referred to as “
personal information
”). We collect this information the first time Vungle’s SDK is initialized on a Publisher Client’s app. Note, however, that Vungle’s Ad Services do not collect any information that that enables us to identify End Users personally (such as your name, address, or email address).
LEARN MORE
The information we collect includes:
Information about your device
, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address, Vungle SDK version, information about the Publisher Client’s app currently active on your device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer or Publisher Client’s app).
Information about your behavior on our Publisher Client’s app
, such as information about the activities or actions on those apps, and session start/stop time. Historic versions of Vungle technology may also collect geolocation information (e.g., latitude and longitude co-ordinates), but only (i) if the Publisher Client’s app has enabled location services on your device and (ii) you have granted the Publisher permission to collect this information). However, versions that are current as of the date of this Notice no longer collect geolocation information.
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on
, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, the number of times you have seen the ad, the number of Vungle ads viewed per session, and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.
We may also combine and/or enhance the information we collect about your device, including the personal information, with information we may collect about your interactions with other ads served through Vungle’s Platform that you may view on other Publisher Client’s Apps, or with information collected from our Clients and third parties (such as data providers). This may include, for example, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on an app to help make the ads served to you more relevant while limiting your exposure to less relevant ads. We (or our third party partners) may also use this additional information to undertake “user matching,” which means that in addition to the ID an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Clients have assigned to an End User.
2.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information, including the personal information, we collect (sometimes in combination with information provided and sourced by independent validation partners) for a variety of business purposes, including the following:
Serving Ads:
To allow Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their apps, and Advertisers to bid on and display ads in that inventory.
Ad Reporting and Conversions:
: To allow Vungle to confirm with Advertisers information about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website and to ensure accurate billing for advertising services rendered.
Frequency Capping:
Preventing End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.
Customizing Ads:
To customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to you and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting your exposure to less relevant ads).
Performance Analytics and Optimization:
To analyze and optimize ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, implementing end user “whitelists” or “blacklists” (to ensure, in some cases, that certain ads are being viewed by appropriate audiences), as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Fraud Detection and Prevention:
Identifying invalid clicks, installs, or ad queries, and protecting us and our Clients from fraudulent behavior.
Providing and Improving the Vungle Ad Services:
Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to provide, protect, and improve the Vungle Ad Services and to ensure that our technologies function properly.
2.3
How does Vungle use its technology to collect information
?
We use our technology (in some jurisdictions, such as the EU, these may be referred to as “tracking technologies”) to collect information automatically from your device to perform many of the functions described in “
How do we use your information?
” above. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions for opting out in the apps, as described in “
Opt-Out Choices
” below.
LEARN MORE
The standard tracking technologies we use include:
Mobile “SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” (including our own SDKs):
These are blocks of code that are embedded into an app allowing Vungle to collect certain information (as described in “
2.1 What information do we collect?
” above relating to your use of apps using our technology. The embedded code from Vungle’s SDK allows the app to “speak” with Vungle’s Platform for purposes of delivering ads.
Mobile device identifiers:
We also use standard device identifiers, for example the IDFA advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices and the GAID advertising identifier used on Android devices, to monitor and improve the performance of the ads we show you.
Third-Party Ad Measurement URLs/Links:
Additionally, in providing the Vungle Ad Services to our Advertiser Clients, the Vungle ads may include URLs or links from the Advertiser Client’s chosen third-party measurement partner to collect information about your interaction with those ads. The information collected is used for ad delivery, reporting, and billing purposes and may also be used for performance optimization.
“Tags and Pixels”:
These are blocks of code that we and our Clients may use to monitor your interaction with apps using our technology. We may use these to synchronize information that we have collected with information independently collected by our Clients and other third party advertising platforms and advertisers that are interested in providing you with ads.
2.4 Your Opt-Out Choices.
You can opt out of having your information being used by Vungle for performance-based advertising by accessing your mobile device settings and following the most recent published instructions. If you limit ad tracking, you will still see advertisements (even ones sourced from Vungle’s network), but Vungle will no longer be able to use the personal information described above in
Section 2.1
to serve you with more relevant ads. In addition, the advertising identifier (along with any information collected about that identifier) that was previously assigned to you will also be disassociated. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt back in, we will not be able to use any of your past information for advertising purposes, and you will (for all practical purposes) be a new user to our system. For apps using older versions of the Vungle SDK, you may also stop the collection of location information by particular apps that may allow collection of location of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
2.5 How Do We Share Information?
Please see Section 4.1,
below
for information concerning how Vungle shares the information collected.
2.6 Privacy Practices of Vungle Clients.
Vungle is not responsible for the information practices of our Clients or their agents. We require our Clients to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide End Users with notice of the collection of data for advertising purposes as outlined in this Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of apps you visit for information about those apps’ data collection and use practices.
2.7 Minors and Children.
Our Clients are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply with data privacy protection legislation applicable to minors and children, such as the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
“), including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information. With respect to COPPA specifically, we rely upon our Publisher Clients to confirm whether or not their app is subject to COPPA. As required by COPPA, Vungle will enable a flag in our system when a Client indicates their app is subject to COPPA such that the End User’s device history is disassociated, and the only End User personal information used by the Vungle Ad Services would be persistent identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) to provide “support for internal operations” of the Vungle Ad Services (as permitted by COPPA).
3. VUNGLE WEBSITES
This Section describes how we collect and use Information in the usual course of business, including through our websites (such as
“http://vungle.com”
or any other website on which this Notice is posted) and other corporate services, web portals, and dashboards we make available to our Clients and End Users (collectively “
Websites
“), as well as in connection with our events, sales and marketing activities. This section does not apply to information collection through apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.
3.1 What information do we collect?

Certain parts of our Websites may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, when Clients are registering for a Vungle account, expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about Vungle or our products and services, subscribing to marketing or otherwise contacting us, Vungle collects required personal information from you. The personal information that you are asked to provide (and the reasons why you are asked to provide it) will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information. We will also let you know prior to collection whether the provision of personal information we are collecting is compulsory or may be provided on a voluntary basis, and the consequences (if any) of not providing the information. We also collect personal information you otherwise submit to us, such as when you send Vungle an email.
LEARN MORE
The personal information we collect may include contact information (such as your name, address, telephone number or email address) and contact preferences. It may also include professional information, such as your job title, department or job role, as well as the nature of your request or communication. We also collect information you choose to provide to us when completing any ‘free text’ boxes in our forms (for example, for event sign-up, product feedback or survey requests).
Information we collect automatically:
When using our Websites, we may automatically collect certain information from your device or computer. In some countries, including countries in the EU, this information may be considered personal information under data protection laws.Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include your IP address, your operating system, your browser ID, your browsing activity, and other information about your system and connection, and how you interact with our Websites and other websites. We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, as explained further under the heading “
Cookies and similar tracking technology
.”
Information we collect from third party sources:
We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, data providers, and social media platforms. Examples of the information we could receive from other sources include account information, page-views, and browsing information.
3.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information we collect or receive to:
Send you marketing and promotional communications.
For example, we and/or our third party marketing partners may use the personal information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing preferences. However, you will always be able to opt-out of our marketing at any time (see the “
Your Choices
” section above).

Section 4.1

4.4 Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA residents only).
If you are an individual from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the details provided under the heading “
Contact Us
” below.
4.5 Third-Party Websites and Apps.
This Notice only applies to the Vungle Websites and Vungle Ad Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of websites, developers, or apps that use or access the Vungle Services or Vungle Ad Services. In addition, ads within the Vungle Platform may contain links to third-party websites and apps. Any access to and use of such linked websites or apps is not governed by this Notice, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties.
4.6 How do we keep your personal information secure?
We use appropriate administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and to help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. Specific measures we will use include hashing and pseudonymization of data prior to storage. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you should take care in deciding what information you send us in this way.
4.7 Data Retention.
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such data or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If you are an End User, we typically store the personal information we collect about you, such as your IP address and other information described above, for 13 months from the date of last collection before we delete, overwrite, or anonymize that data, unless we are required to keep it to comply with a legal or audit obligation.
Please contact us at privacy@vungle.com if you have any questions about the information we collect and/or how we use the information we collect.

These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request. .

means these Tapjoy Advertiser Terms of Service.
2. ADVERTISING SERVICE AND ADVERTISER OBLIGATIONS
2.1 Insertion Orders.
You and Tapjoy may agree upon IOs or other contracting mechanisms governed by these Terms that specify the details of your campaign, including: the type and quantity of ad placements; the bid price per Conversion desired; the maximum campaign budget; and the campaign start and end dates. IO details, such as bid price and campaign dates, may be subsequently modified by email confirmation or agreement. You acknowledge that budget allocations and daily targets are estimates only.
2.2 Campaign Content, Tracking, and License.
You will deliver your Campaign Content and implement conversion tracking in accordance with the applicable Tapjoy technical specifications, and Tapjoy will make commercially reasonable efforts to serve your Campaign Content to the Inventory in accordance with the IO and as otherwise directed by you based on your selections in the Tapjoy Dashboard. As between you and us, you are solely responsible for your costs to produce and deliver Campaign Content, and for the content of your Campaign Content. You hereby grant to Tapjoy the worldwide, non-sublicensable (except to the extent required by Tapjoy to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement), non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, right and license to use, serve, copy, reproduce, distribute and display, in any medium now known or hereafter developed, the Campaign Content, along with the data referenced in Section 4 (Data Use). Tapjoy will not modify or alter your Campaign Content without your prior written consent, except as required for or otherwise incidental to technical implementation by Tapjoy of your campaign.
2.3 Tapjoy Dashboard.
You may use Tapjoy’s online campaign management portal (currently
https://dashboard.tapjoy.com/
) (the “
Tapjoy Dashboard
”) to make campaign-related selections, including setting the campaign budget, sums to be spent on a daily basis, and dates or targets for delivery of Campaign Content. You understand that, because the Advertising Services involve users’ independent decisions about whether to engage with your Campaign Content, the sums allocated for a particular day, targets for delivery, and budget allocation between ad units are estimates and not guaranteed; to this end, Tapjoy is not liable if your advertising spend on a particular day is less (or more) than the intended amount. By way of example, if you set a daily spend limit, Tapjoy may need to serve additional Campaign Content in order to drive the requested number of Conversions because not all Campaign Content will necessarily result in a Conversion. Your Tapjoy Dashboard account is specific to you and should not be shared with third parties, except to the extent you authorize an agency to operate it on your behalf, and you are responsible for any account activities, whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for protecting the security of your account credentials and notifying Tapjoy immediately of any unauthorized access or use or other security breach.
2.4 Limited Transparency and Non-Circumvention.
The identity of apps and publishers within the Inventory is Tapjoy Confidential Information subject to Section 6 (Confidentiality) and is provided to you solely for the purposes of brand safety and campaign optimization. You agree not to use the Advertising Service to identify these apps or publishers and intentionally bypass our Advertising Service to work directly with them.
2.5 Content Maturity and Targeting.
You agree to ensure that your Campaign Content will be appropriately targeted and tagged, including but not limited to maturity level; that no Campaign Content will be directed to children under 13; that any Campaign Content directed to youths (meaning users younger than 18) will comply with the guidelines of the applicable local self-regulatory organization (e.g., the Children’s Advertising Review Unit in the U.S.) in the region(s) targeted by the applicable campaign; and that your use of the Service will be in compliance with applicable Laws.
2.6 Data Privacy.
As a condition of using our Advertising Services, you agree to be bound by our Tapjoy
DPA
, absent a separate written agreement with us with substantially similar terms regarding our respective obligations under applicable data protection Laws. You represent and warrant that you have notice and consent mechanisms in place that are sufficient to allow us to use data provided by or on behalf of you to Tapjoy in connection with the Advertising Service for conversion tracking, provision, monitoring, improvement and diagnosis of the Advertising Service, filtering and targeting of campaigns, and otherwise in accordance with any expressed user desires (e.g., opt-outs), the
Privacy Policy
, and, if applicable, the Tapjoy
DPA
. You and we will each maintain a privacy policy in accordance with all applicable Laws that accurately describes our respective practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data under this Agreement.
2.7 Prohibitions.
You agree not to attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Advertising Service or prevent others from accessing or using the Advertising Service; or otherwise use the Advertising Service in a manner not expressly authorized hereunder or for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose, and to promptly notify us in writing if you become aware of any breach of this Section. Without reducing your obligations, Tapjoy reserves the right, without obligation, to review Campaign Content or your use of the Advertising Service to determine whether a breach of this Agreement has occurred, or to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.
2.8 Video Campaigns.
The minimum attribution window for video campaigns billed on a CPI basis, unless otherwise specified, is seven (7) days after completed video view or user-initiated click
2.9 Offerwall Campaigns.
For Offerwall campaigns (CPA, CPE, CPI, MR-CPE), the following terms apply:
a. Attribution Windows (unless otherwise agreed):
(i) CPA – maximum of sixty (60) days;
(ii) CPE – maximum of ninety (90) days;
(iii) CPI – minimum of forty-eight (48) hours;
(iv) MR-CPE – maximum of ninety (90) days.
b. User Experience. To help provide a high quality experience for users engaging with your offers, you agree to clearly, accurately, and prominently represent all requirements relevant to a user’s completion of your offer, to signal Tapjoy each time a user completes your offer, and to provide advance written notice of any material changes to your offer. Offer requirement disclosures must include, at minimum, the specific conversion action the user must complete to earn the reward and the rules and conditions applicable to the offer (e.g., “new users only”). If your Conversion signals will be delayed (e.g., if you batch Conversions and report them to Tapjoy once a day, rather than reporting them as they occur), your offer must accurately say so.
c. User Support. Tapjoy offers customer support to assist users who believe they earned, but have not received, offer rewards. To support these users, you agree to provide timely assistance in investigating support tickets, to collaborate with Tapjoy to resolve any technical issues affecting reward delivery, and to acknowledge Conversions validated through customer support as billable events.
3. PAYMENT
3.1 Invoices and Payment.
You will pay Tapjoy for all Conversions generated during each campaign. Invoices will be sent to you upon completion of every calendar month in which your applicable IO is active or within thirty (30) days of completion of the IO, whichever is earlier. All amounts are invoiced and must be paid in United States Dollars, with payments due net 30 of invoice. Any prepaid amounts are non-refundable.
3.2 Reporting.
Unless otherwise agreed to in the applicable IO or as stated in the applicable addendum below, Tapjoy’s measurements govern billing and reporting. Conversions are billable if they occur within the attribution window, if commenced before campaign termination or pause. Tapjoy reporting shall be made available to you via the Tapjoy Dashboard. All billing and transaction times referenced by Tapjoy reports are on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
3.3 Anti-Fraud Measures.
We employ systems designed to detect and block potentially fraudulent or invalid activity, but our systems cannot guarantee detection of all potentially suspect activity. Accordingly, to protect the Tapjoy network and alert Tapjoy to any potential issues, you acknowledge that you are responsible for reviewing your campaign for any suspicious activity and reporting any such concerns as soon as possible and, in any case, by the payment due date of the applicable invoice. Claims based solely on analyses or reports by fourth-party fraud detection vendors will not be accepted. Notice should go by email to your Tapjoy Account Manager and include all evidence supporting your claim, with a copy to discrepancy@tapjoy.com.
3.4 Measurement or Other Discrepancies.
If you, in good faith, believe the invoiced amount is inaccurate, you may dispute the amount by notifying your Tapjoy Account Manager and providing your supporting documentation as soon as possible and, in any case, no later than the applicable invoice due date. You agree to reasonably cooperate with us to investigate your concern and reach a good faith resolution, and understand that failure to notify us before the applicable invoice due date waives your right to dispute it at a later date. We reserve the right to provide compensation in the form of marketing credits in lieu of cash. Tapjoy reserves the right to charge interest on undisputed invoices not timely paid, at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.
3.5 Taxes.
If withholding taxes or other taxes are imposed on you by your local jurisdiction, you shall promptly pay such taxes to ensure that Tapjoy receives the full amount invoiced to you without offset or deduction. Upon payment of such taxes, you will provide Tapjoy with the applicable receipts or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case within five (5) business days of written request.
3.6 Added Value.
If an IO indicates additional Conversions to be delivered at no extra cost to you (
“Added-Value Placements”
), they are non-guaranteed estimates and included for reference only. Fulfillment (or lack thereof) of Added-Value Placements does not affect campaign billing or reporting.
4. DATA USE
4.1. Your use of the Advertising Services generates data that we use to enhance and optimize the Advertising Services (
“Campaign Data”
). Campaign Data includes data about users’ interaction with your ads, such as ad impressions, users’ clicks, Conversions, or other interactions with your Campaign Content, and excludes personally identifiable information submitted by individual users directly to you as part of completing your ad offer (
“User-Volunteered Data”
). Campaign Data may be used by each of us to fulfill our respective obligations in accordance with an applicable IO, and as permitted under our respective privacy policies, applicable Laws, and this Agreement. As between you and Tapjoy, User-Volunteered Data is your property, subject to your posted privacy policy, and is considered your Confidential Information. The terms of this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason.
4.2. You may choose to provide us with personal data for use solely for your benefit in connection with your use of the Advertising Service (e.g., targeting or suppression lists) (“
Advertising Service Data
”). You represent and warrant that you have notice and consent mechanisms in place that are sufficient to allow us to use Advertising Service Data for the purpose for which it was provided, and we agree to use that data specifically for the purpose provided (e.g., targeting or suppression).
5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP
As between the parties, and subject to the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement: You and your licensors own and will retain all right, title, and interest in and to your Campaign Content, and we and our licensors own and will retain all right, title, and interest in and to our Advertising Services, including all related information and software (and improvements and updates).
6. CONFIDENTIALITY
6.1 Confidential Information and Obligations.
Each of us agrees not to disclose the other’s Confidential Information, and to use it only to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement. “
Confidential Information
” means information identified as “confidential” or “proprietary” or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential. For purposes of this Agreement, Campaign Content (before publication) and any end-user data you provide for the purposes of campaign targeting or suppression are deemed your Confidential Information; and our pricing, pricing structures, statistics and other data relating to the Advertising Service, revenue, commercial partners, financial model, and methodologies are deemed Tapjoy Confidential Information. A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and/or advisors with a need to know, provided that they are under an obligation of confidentiality no less protective than this one.
6.2 Exclusions.
Confidential Information does not include information that was independently developed by the receiving party, that is or becomes publicly known without the receiving party’s fault, or that was lawfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information without breach of this Section, if required by act of law or order, provided that where feasible it gives the other party prompt notice of the requirement before disclosure, limits disclosure as much as possible, and provides its reasonable assistance to the other party if it seeks to obtain an order to protect the information from public disclosure.
6.3 Return/Destruction.
Upon the disclosing party’s reasonable request or the termination of this Agreement, the receiving party will promptly return or destroy the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and upon request certify in writing its return or destruction.
7. TERM AND TERMINATION
The term of this Agreement begins on the acceptance of these Terms and continues in effect until either party terminates this Agreement as set forth herein. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reject or remove any Campaign Content and to restrict, pause or suspend your access to or use of the Advertising Services at any time and with or without notice, without liability to you. Either you or we may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon fourteen (14) days’ written notice; termination of this Agreement also terminates any outstanding IOs, but does not relieve you or us of any obligation to pay amounts due and owing as of the termination date; that obligation survives termination, and for avoidance of doubt, includes all Post Campaign Conversions whenever such conversions arise (even if after the date of termination). Sections 3 (with respect to any payment obligations then existing), 4 through 7, and 9 through 14 will survive expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason.
8. MARKETING
You hereby grant us a royalty-free, fully paid up, sub-licensable, transferable, nonexclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to reproduce, display, distribute, and otherwise use, in connection with our Advertising Services, the trademarks, service marks, logos or other indicia of origin associated with you and your application(s) (your “
Marks
”), for the purpose of promoting you and your application(s) in our advertising, marketing, promotions and promotional materials. You agree that we may use your Marks on our website to show your use of our Advertising Services; for other proposed uses of your Marks, we will request your prior written approval.
9. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS

10.3 Indemnity Requirements.
The indemnifying party reserves the right, at its expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which it is required to indemnify the indemnified party, and the indemnified party agrees to reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying party’s defense of such claims and shall have the right to participate with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement of any claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
11. DISCLAIMERS
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, TAPJOY, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATEs, DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PROVISION OR YOUR USE OF THE ADVERTISING SERVICES, OTHER TAPJOY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND THE TAPJOY NETWORK, IN EACH CASE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND; THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATIONS, WARRANTIES OF PERFORMANCE AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FURTHER, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES ARE OR WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, OR UNINTERRUPTED. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE: (A) THE RESULTS OF USE OF THE ADVERTISING SERVICE, INCLUDING THE VOLUME OR TIMING OF USER ACTIONS OR THE RESULTS OF ANY SPECIFIC CAMPAIGN, AND ADVERTISER ASSUMES ALL RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT THERETO; (B) THE POSITIONING, RANKING, RATING, LEVELS, OR TIMING OF DELIVERY OF ADVERTISER’S CAMPAIGN CONTENT ON SPECIFIC PUBLISHERS’ INVENTORY, OR CLICKS, CONVERSION RATES, OR OTHER USER ACTIONS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ADVERTISING SERVICE IS BASED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, ON AN AUCTION MODEL, AND CONSEQUENTLY VOLUMES MAY VARY BASED ON PRICE, CONVERSION RATES, USER ACTIONS, PUBLISHER CURRENCY SETTINGS, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY NOT BE WITHIN TAPJOY’S CONTROL. You acknowledge and agree that we are not affiliated with or responsible for your products or services or any third-party products or services displayed, distributed or otherwise promoted through our Advertising Services, including your Campaign Content and that of other advertisers related to their products or services. We neither represent nor endorse the quality, accuracy, reliability, integrity or legality of your or any third-party products or services, nor the truth or accuracy of the description of your or any third-party Campaign Content, including ads, offers, links, content, advice, opinions, offers, proposals, statements, data, or other information, provided by third parties and displayed, distributed, or otherwise used on or in connection with our Advertising Services.
12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; LIABILITY CAP
IN NO EVENT WILL TAPJOY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST INCOME, REVENUE OR PROFITS, LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF WE KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF ALL LOSSES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL PAID OR PAYABLE TO TAPJOY UNDER THE IO TO WHICH THE CLAIM RELATES IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU; IN SUCH CASES, TAPJOY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND REFLECTS A FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK. WE WOULD NOT PROVIDE OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS, AND YOU AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS, AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE AND WILL SURVIVE EVEN IF OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES, THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY ELEMENT OF IT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED IN ITS OR THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BOTH PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE RAISED WITHIN 12 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF ITS ACCRUAL, OR IT SHALL BE FOREVER WAIVED.

13. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
13.1 Governing Law.
The parties agree that California law governs this Agreement, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of law, and to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California for any claims not arbitrated as set forth below.
13.2 Arbitration.
Except for the exceptions described below, the parties agree to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between us arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including over its validity or enforceability) by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, before a single arbitrator, governed by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (collectively, “
JAMS Rules
”), as modified by this Agreement, and administered by JAMS; see
http://www.jamsadr.com
or call JAMS (1-800-352-5267 for JAMS Rules and fee information. Dispositive motions will be allowed; the arbitrator must follow this Agreement, will have the same power to award damages and relief as a court (including fees), and will issue a binding written decision, which can be enforced by entry of judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction. Both parties agree and understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial, and further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation, and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
13.3 Individual Actions Only.
EITHER OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF, AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER PARTIES.
13.4 Exceptions.
The following are exceptions to the foregoing general agreement to arbitrate: (a) claims concerning intellectual property (i.e., patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks) and confidentiality (i.e., over Confidential Information or trade secrets); (b) claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Advertising Service; or (c) your failure to pay fees or the recovery of money owed by you to Tapjoy and (d) small claims, where jurisdiction and venue otherwise qualify for small claims court and where no equitable relief is sought (collectively, “
Excluded Claims
”). The parties agree to waive trial by jury in any litigation between them in court (e.g., if the arbitration provision is found unenforceable, or if the matter concerns one of the foregoing exceptions).
13.5 Applicability to Corporate Affiliates.
This Section will also apply to any claims asserted by you, or your parent, subsidiary, or corporate affiliate(s), against any Tapjoy parent, subsidiary, or corporate affiliate(s), and likewise to any claims asserted by any of them against you or your corporate affiliates, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Terms (including with respect to their validity or enforceability).
14. MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement, including the Tapjoy
DPA
and any IOs as applicable, sets forth the entire agreement between you and Tapjoy, and supersedes any prior or concurrent agreements (whether written or oral) with respect to its subject matter. In the event of conflict or inconsistency between an IO, these Terms, or the
DPA
, the documents shall govern and control in that order. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue our Services without notice and without liability to you or any third party. You cannot assign this Agreement without our prior written consent, and any attempt will be null and void; provided, however, that you may assign the Agreement without such consent to any entity that is not a competitor of Tapjoy in connection with the merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of your assets, or any other transaction in which more than fifty percent (50%) of your voting securities are transferred. This Agreement is binding upon permitted successors and assigns, and there are no third-party rights unless expressly specified. You and Tapjoy are independent contractors, not agents, representatives, or partners. Waiver of any breach of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other breach, and will not act to reduce the rights of the waiving party. In the case of conflict between or among these Terms, the IO, or the Tapjoy
DPA
, the order of precedence shall be the IO, then these Terms, then the Tapjoy
DPA
. Preprinted terms on purchase orders or other transactional documents are of no force or effect. Neither of us will be liable for failure to perform due to a cause beyond your or our reasonable control, respectively, including, without limitation, terrorism, fire, civil disturbance, war, rebellion, earthquake, flood and similar occurrences, provided that performance resumes as soon as commercially practicable after the cause no longer prevents performance. Headings are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation. Notice to Tapjoy shall be made via email to your Tapjoy account manager, with a copy to legal@tapjoy.com; notice to you shall be made to the email address in your Tapjoy dashboard advertiser account, in each case with copies sent by overnight courier to your and our mailing addresses as set forth in the most recent IO, marked “Attention: Legal”.

Who are we?
Karmafy is a software service owned and operated by Karma Holdings Ltd., (company no. C65879), Seaview apt. 4, Ix-Xatt Ta' Qui-Si-Sana, Sliema SLM3130, Malta.
Please direct questions and comments on this Privacy Policy to
dataprotection@karmafy.com
.
What is Karmafy?
Karmafy Points are a global currency for doing good.  You earn Karmafy Points by using a Karmafy-enabled app, website, or other service ("Services"). Karmafy keeps track of your Karma Points and how you choose to spend them. The Karmafy experience as embedded in apps, games, websites, or other services, is governed by an agreement between Karmafy and the owner or operator of such services (“Service Provider”). In order to deliver the Karmafy experience and to determine the Service Provider’s charitable contribution and service fee, we keep a record of some of your activities in the Service as described below.
Your Service Provider’s privacy policy may have additional information about their integration with Karmafy.
Using a Karmafy-enabled Service
As an Anonymous User
When you start using a Karmafy-enabled Service, we create an anonymous Karmafy account to hold the Karmafy Points you earn. The account is identified by a random number and does not reveal your real identity to Karmafy. While you are using the app, we will record the following data:
In-app activities that can earn you Karmafy points, e.g., completing a level in a game, making an in-app purchase, beating a high score, watching advertising material.
A history of Karmafy Points earned and how you earned them.
Your choice of one or more causes as beneficiary/ies of the Karmafy Points you earn. This includes previous choices, even if you change your mind later.
Possibly your user name and/or user ID in the Service itself, if the Service developer has chosen to support this.
Device settings that improve the user experience, such as your language preferences and the device type.
The IP number currently assigned to your device. This is usually enough information to determine the country and city you’re in.
While you are using a Karmafy-enabled app anonymously, we will not:
Ask for your personal identity or attempt to figure it out.
Access personal information on your device, such as contacts, messages, photos, etc.
Attempt to determine your exact physical location.
Occasionally, you will be presented with the option of sharing your Karmafy activities through a third-party channel such as Facebook, Twitter, email, etc. In this case, the privacy policy of operators of such services applies. Karmafy will not associate your identity in the third-party service with your anonymous Karmafy account.
As a Registered User
You will be given the option of registering with Karmafy and becoming a Karmafy user. This requires you to identify yourself with either a valid email address and/or log in through a third-party service such as Facebook. You will be asked to choose a user name. Your email address, Facebook identity and Karmafy user name will be recorded and stored by Karmafy.
As a registered Karmafy user, you use a single account to hold the Karmafy Points you earn in all Karmafy-enabled apps. You will be able to access the Karmafy website to view and modify all information associated with your account.
Since we intend to build a social network for doing good, the following information about you may be made available to other participants in the network:
Your user name and (if uploaded) profile picture.
Your total earned Karma Points, achievements, high scores, etc.
Your selections, contributions and interactions with causes.
Nobody but Karmafy will have access to your personal identity such as email address and Facebook user ID. We will not share this information with anybody without your consent, except in certain cases with the Service Provider for resolution of disputes.
Your Rights
You can access, change, and remove personal information through the Karmafy Menu inside the Service.
You are entitled to view the entire set of your personal data held by Karmafy.
If you believe Karmafy is holding erroneous, outdated, or irrelevant personal data, you are entitled to request the rectification or erasure of such data.
You are entitled to withdraw your consent to Karmafy processing any of your data.
From within mobile apps, use the button “Data Access Rights” in the Settings menu. If you have registered with email and password, you can also simply send an email to dataprotection@karmafy.com.
Note that in order to correctly invoice the Service Provider, Karmafy is allowed to retain records necessary to prove that the Karmafy experience has been delivered to you prior to your withdrawal of consent.
Third-party Data Processors
In operating Karmafy, we make use of several third-party services:
Google Analytics. We use GA for statistical and monitoring purposes only. We may send records of your Karmafy activities to GA, but in anonymised form.
Branch.io. Used for attributing new installs to selection of HTTP links, Facebook shares, etc. We are not sending personal user data to Branch.io.
We may choose to contract with additional third-party services in the future, but we will always anonymise your data.
Security
We endeavour to keep your information secure through industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. If we detect a breach of security that may have caused your information to be revealed or compromised, we shall notify you.
Hosting Service
The Karmafy servers are hosted by Hetzner GmbH in data centres located in Germany.
Changes to this Policy
Changes to this policy will be announced on the Karmafy web site and, if such changes have direct relevance to yourself, in a message displayed inside Karmafy-enabled Services.
Legislation
As a company operating in Malta, Karmafy is required to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679). The Supervisory Authority is: Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, 2, Airways House, High Street, Sliema SLM 1549, tel. +356 2328 7100, http://www.dataprotection.gov.mt/.
