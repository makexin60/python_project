What personal information we collect and how we use the information
We collect limited information about you in our Game. This covers all data that is sent off of your device to our servers, including data collected for short term transient use. The information we collect about your use of the Game includes:
Game progression to enable your use of the Game;
Technical identifiers (such as game specific randomly generated player id, or IP address) to enable your use of the Game, including the multiplayer features within the Game. For multiplayer gameplay, the IP address is not retained, but rather processed during each multiplayer round and removed shortly after the multiplayer game is over; and
Your Game Center nickname to enable the multiplayer features within the Game.
We may receive anonymous aggregate analytics information about the use of the Game through Apple App Store Connect from such players who have agreed (opt-in) to this. We process and use this information to improve and develop the Game.
We also use the above-listed data to provide you with player / customer support.
Our legal basis for the processing of personal information is mainly the performance of the contract with you (to provide you with a Game service you have requested). Other processing is based on our legitimate interest (the player relationship between us).
We will ask your consent if we need to collect data for other purposes not explained in this Privacy Policy.

We use appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.
