Introduction
Popsa (referred to as "Popsa", "we", "our" or "us") takes your privacy very seriously. We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully as it contains important information about what to expect when we collect personal information about you as a result of using our mobile applications ("App" or "Apps") (regardless of where you visit it from) our web services such as

This Privacy Policy forms part of our
Terms of Service
and also incorporates our
Acceptable Use Policy
and our
Cookie Policy
. It is important that you read this privacy notice, together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice that we may provide by notification in our App from time to time, so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data.
Definitions used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as set out in our
Terms of Service
.
Popsa works closely with print partners at locations throughout the world ("Partners") to manufacture

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.
1. The information we collect about you
When you use our Apps or Website to browse our products, create designs or purchase services or subscriptions from us, or when you correspond with us directly through email, post or by telephone, we may collect information about your identity, how to contact you, and limited financial information.
As is usual, we automatically collect technical data about how you are using our App or Website, and behavioural data that allows us to understand how our users and customers interact with our products and services. This information is tracked using services provided by third parties, such as Google Analytics.
Where you have supplied your contact information to 3rd parties for the purpose of marketing, we will rely on our Legitimate Interest to contact you via the telephone or post.
When you use our Apps:
We collect technical and usage data whenever you use our Apps. This includes your IP address, the version of the app you are using, your time-zone and information that allows us to understand how people use our App.
We also collect information about your preferred language. This is detected from the device you are using, and we use this to tailor our communications with you and to display information to you in the correct language. This preference can be changed in our Apps, in the Settings page.
This information is added to a profile we hold on you ("User Profile"). This profile is automatically updated over time as you use our App and services and is kept up to date with your marketing preferences.
When you visit our Website, or use secure features available on our website:
We use cookies for the following purposes:
Authentication and security:
for example, to tell us when you are logged in so we can show you your information and relevant data and protect your account from unauthorised users.
App features and other services:
we may use cookies to deliver new features and services.
Analytics and research:
we collect data about App usage to analyse where improvements can be made and provide an easy to use overall user experience of our App and our ordering processes.
Cookies or other tracking technologies are text files placed on your computer to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information. The information is used to track visitor use of our Apps and Websites and to compile statistical reports on browsing activity. For information about the cookies and other tracking devices used on our Apps and Websites and how to disable them, we recommend visiting
www.aboutcookies.org
or
www.allaboutcookies.org
. You can set your browser not to accept cookies and the above websites tell you how to remove cookies from your browser. However, some of our App features may not function if you remove cookies from your browser.
For detailed information about our use of cookies,
please see our Cookie Policy.
When you create an account using an email address:
Initially, we collect some basic information such as your name and your email address. If you choose to place an order with us, we request that you set a password, which we then cryptographically store so we can protect your account and information. We never see your actual password.
When you create an account using Facebook:
We request the email address, name, gender and the date of birth that you registered with Facebook. You are given an opportunity to deny this request in part or in total during the authentication process. If you do not provide us with a valid email address that we can use to contact you, we may be unable to fulfil our service to you.
When you create an account using Twitter:
We request the email address and name that you have registered with Twitter. You are given an to deny this request during the authentication process. If you do not provide us with a valid email address that we can use to contact you, we may be unable to fulfil our service to you.
When you grant our app permission to access your Photo Library:
We collect some statistical information about your photo library, such as the number of photos you have taken in total, and the median number of photos you have taken over recent months. This allows us to enable features to customers who have a sufficient number of photos in their photo library.
When you select photos to use in a photo-personalised product while using our App:
Our proprietary "PrintAI" algorithm will perform analysis of the photos you select so that it can create an aesthetically pleasing design as if a human had designed it.
The algorithm assesses a photo's date, dimensions, location of any faces, and how close the photo is chronologically to other photos in your selection. This information is used to heuristically determine the best positions and sequence of the photos.
When you enable the Popsa Assistant ("Assistant"):
Photos in your library will be analysed to provide an automatic photo curation service. The assistant runs as part of the Popsa App and performs analysis on your mobile device, however it may occasionally upload small versions of some photos to our servers for further analysis; this is done anonymously. The Assistant will perform multiple analyses on photos in your library, asking questions such as "is this photo a screenshot", "are faces present in this photo", "is this face similar to other faces in the photo library", "is there a famous landmark in this photo". This information is used to determine whether a photo should be included in a curated list of photos that could be used to create a photo-personalised product.
The Assistant will also analyse the statistical distribution of photos in your library. This allows it to identify significant events, such as when you go on holiday, so that it can help you select large groups of relevant photos easily.
With your permission, the Assistant will keep a secure record of the faces it detects in your photo library. This can help you select groups of faces that are familiar to you, rather than having to browse through thousands of photos yourself.
Wherever possible, the Assistant performs analysis by running processes in the mobile app to ensure a high degree of privacy reduced latency.
When the Popsa Assistant is available to you it will appear as a new item on the Settings page inside the app. You will have the option of turning the Popsa assistant off if you no longer wish to benefit from the help it provides.
When you place an order for a photo-personalised product in our App:
To fulfil an order, we request a delivery address and contact information (such as a phone number) for the intended recipient. We also request a billing address for fraud detection and as a complete record of the transaction. Postal addresses include a name, postal/zip code, and country.
If you choose to pay for your order using a credit or debit card, this payment information is sent directly to our payment-services provider, Stripe, who authorise the purchase on our behalf. We never see or store your card details but we are notified if the transaction succeeds or fails.
If you choose to pay for your order using another service, such as PayPal, we never see your financial data, we are notified that a transaction has either succeeded or failed.
To process your payments by credit or debit card
Payments for our Services by credit and debit cards are processed through our third party payment services processor, Stripe, in accordance with a Merchant Services Agreement between Popsa and Stripe, whose headquarters are at 3180 18th Street, Suite 100, San Francisco. When you reach the checkout stage of our ordering process, our App passes the credit/debit card details you provided securely and directly to Stripe to authorise the transaction with your bank or credit card company. Popsa does not, store any credit/debit card details. We require Stripe and all of our Partners to maintain levels of security that are adequate and appropriate to protect your information in accordance with all applicable legislation. We strongly recommend you visit Stripe's website at and review their terms and conditions
https://stripe.com/gb/terms
and in particular their privacy policy
https://stripe.com/gb/privacy
which sets out how they use and store your information.
Please note that Popsa does not store your credit/debit card information at any time, nor do we have sight of any credit/debit card details that you enter when paying for our Services. Payment information and authorisation is relayed to us from Stripe using tokenisation technology which means your credit/debit card data never passes through our servers at any time. We will not be legally responsible to you for any loss that you may suffer if a third-party gains unauthorised access to any information that you provide to Stripe.
To process payments by PayPal
If you choose to pay via PayPal you will be securely redirected to a PayPal operated site or mobile app, although this may appear to be presented within our App. We will not see any of your financial information held by PayPal nor we will ever see the username, email or password that you use to authenticate with PayPal. We will only be notified that the transaction has completed successfully or that it has failed, and we may be given a reason explaining why the transaction failed (e.g. "insufficient funds", or "card reported as stolen").
We strongly recommend that you visit Paypal's website and review their privacy policy, available
https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full
which sets out how they protect your information.
When you contact our support team:
We keep a record of the communications you have with us in which you may volunteer any information.
When you enter a competition, or complete a survey:
We may add the responses you provide to your User Profile so we can provide a better and more customised service to you in the future.

Aggregated Data
such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does

In this case, we may have to cancel an Order you have placed with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time if you have provided us with valid contact information.
Occasionally we may receive information about you from other third party sources (such as credit reference agencies) which we may add to information we already hold about you in order to help us verify your identity and improve our Services to you.
To administer your Account and provide you with Support
We may access basic information about Account activity or purchase records held by Stripe or PayPal to be able to process your Orders, administer Services like invoicing, payments, refunds and to assist us to resolve any conflicts that may occur between us, but this information does not include your credit/debit card data.
Requests for further information
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

Popsa systems and processes are configured to strictly comply with the GDPR and we maintain those systems to the industry standard levels required to safeguard your personal information and to ensure rights are always protected.

We share your personal data within the Popsa Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the EEA.
Many of our Partners and other external third parties that we use to provide our Services are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented that is appropriate to the transfer:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.

In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party (data mobility).

Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform our Services to you.
Right to withdraw consent or unsubscribe
We are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, if you notify us to withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

If you wish to cancel your registration, or unsubscribe to our communications, please let us know the correct details by sending a support request to

Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.

The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”).

“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services.

Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the

Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users.

This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.

To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

We may share Personal Data with other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product, such as with Synchrony Bank in connection with the PayPal Extras credit card. These financial institutions may only use this information to market and offer PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses. We may also share Personal Data to process transactions, provide you with benefits associated with your eligible cards, and keep your financial information up to date.
With the other parties to transactions when you use the Services, such as other Users, merchants, and their service providers:

We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.
6. How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?
A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own. When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly. Examples of account connections include:
linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;
connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or
using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.
If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service. For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection. If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers. We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.
Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices. Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection. For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.
7. How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?
When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online Services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a User and to customize your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising; measure the effectiveness of promotions and perform analytics; and to mitigate risk, prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Sites and Services.
