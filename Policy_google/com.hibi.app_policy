Protecting your personal information is our top priority, so we want to be upfront about how we collect, use, and safeguard your data. Here's a quick rundown of our Privacy Policy:
Data We Collect.
When you create your account, we gather basic info like your name and email. As you use the app, you choose what to share about your loved one's health journey.

How We Use Your Info.
We use your data to provide and enhance the Heba service and may send you updates about the app. We'll never sell your personal information.
Data Retention and Deletion.
We'll hold your data only as long as needed or until you request deletion. If you close your account, we may retain data for up to 5 years for legal purposes.
Third-Party Links.
Heba may include links to external websites. Remember, this policy only covers Heba, so review the privacy terms of any other sites you visit.
