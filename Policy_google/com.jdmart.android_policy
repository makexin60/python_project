These Terms of Sale constitute an electronic record within the meaning of the applicable law. This electronic record is generated by a computer system and does not require any physical or digital signatures.
1. Our Contract of Sale
1.1. Listing and display of a Product by the respective Seller(s) on Jd Shopping is  the Seller?s invitation to you to make an offer for purchase of such Product. Likewise, the placement of an order on JD Shopping by you is your offer to buy the Product(s) from the respective Seller(s). The Products shall be sold to you by the third party sellers to which we and our affiliates do not have any control or connection and hence we hold no responsibility or liability of any manner in this regards.
1.2. Once you have placed an order on JD Shopping for purchase of a Product, you will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the

"Shipment Confirmation"
). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever before sending Shipment Confirmation to you.
1.4. You acknowledge that there may be certain Products in your order whose actual quantity may not be known at the time of order placement (for example, fruits, vegetables, etc.). Such Products will therefore be invoiced based on the exact weight at the time of packaging and upon dispatch, our Shipment Confirmation will reflect such marginal variance in the quantity of the Product as against your original order and relevant adjustment in the invoice amount.
1.5. If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive separate Shipment Confirmations for each package, and each Shipment Confirmation and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the Product(s) specified in that Shipment Confirmation.

1.7. You can cancel your order for a Product at no cost at any time before we send the Shipment Confirmation relating to that Product.
1.8. All orders placed on JD Shopping are subject to the availability of such Product, our acceptance of your offer as per the above and your continued adherence to these Terms of Sale.2.
