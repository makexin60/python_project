How We Share Personal Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions Involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the AWS Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.
Third-Party Service Providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Us and Others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of AWS, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.
At Your Option:

How
do
we
uphold
your
privacy
rights?
IN BRIEF
Xsolla will handle your data privacy/subject access request carefully. Below is a general description of how we process such requests.
6. How do we uphold your privacy rights?
We will try to process your request regarding data privacy promptly in the following manner:
In order to ensure your request, Xsolla will ask to verify your identity by providing proof of your previous payment to Xsolla from your payment system account or using the email address linked to your previous payment in Xsolla.
Xsolla will subsequently provide you with information on the action taken with regard to a request without undue delay and in any event within 30 days of receipt of the request.
In the event that you request deletion or erasure of the information, we will
NOT
inform you of the result as we will remove your personal info, including the original email.
Please note that in some exceptional cases, we may suggest that you send a request to a game developer directly due to instructions and agreements between some game developers and Xsolla.
If your response is considerably complex, or we have received a number of different requests from you at once, the timeframe indicated above may be extended by up to 2 months. We will notify you directly of such an extension before the due date of the response in the same manner as the request was made.
Please note that the response may be considered complex according to the specific circumstances of that particular response. For example, if data are already electronically archived, or we need to clarify potential issues around disclosing information concerning a child to a legal guardian or obtain specialist legal advice.
In exceptional cases, we may charge you a reasonable fee for the administrative costs associated with processing your request if the request is demonstrably unfounded or excessive, or the request is unreasonably duplicative.
Xsolla keeps records of privacy requests for no more than 24 months to 5 years on the grounds of applicable legislation (except erasure requests) in order to comply with certain requirements.
When requesting the erasure or deletion of your data, please understand that this action will result in the permanent
removal of all related information from our systems
. This includes, but is not limited to, purchase history, bonuses, accounts, conversations and other personal data.
We kindly advise you to carefully consider the consequences of this decision, as the deletion process is irreversible. Once your data have been deleted, it cannot be recovered. Please evaluate whether you truly wish to proceed with the complete deletion of your data.
If you have any concerns or questions regarding the deletion of your data or its potential impact, we recommend contacting our support team for further clarification before finalizing your decision.

How
do
we
implement
requests
from
authorized
agents?
IN BRIEF
We may receive data privacy/subject access requests from your authorized agent. There are a few specifics regarding the processing of such requests that Xsolla must comply with under the applicable laws.
7. How do we implement requests from authorized agents?
An authorized agent may also send a privacy request on behalf of the user in the same manner as the user may, together with the confirmation of their authority.
In the event that Xsolla receives a request from an authorized agent without any confirmation of their authority, we may ask such authorized agent the following in order to verify the authenticity and validity of the request:
To provide signed permission confirming the authority of the agent;
To confirm the user’s identity or provide a Power of Attorney where applicable.
Xsolla may deny a request from an authorized agent who does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the user to act on their behalf.

The period for which Xsolla retains personal data may also be determined by legal and regulatory requirements and safety, security and fraud prevention purposes. For example, we retain data:

.
14. Automated decision-making, including profiling
Automated decision-making and profiling are utilized by Xsolla in specific cases to ensure secure transactions and to enhance our services and make them more convenient for you. These processes involve the use of algorithms and statistical models to analyze data and make decisions without human intervention. Xsolla uses automated decision-making and profiling in the following ways:
Anti-Fraud System
: We utilize automated decision-making and profiling in our anti-fraud system to prevent fraudulent activities. This includes segmenting users based on various factors to determine appropriate payment limits or restrictions across different projects. By employing these measures, we aim to protect the integrity of our services and ensure a secure environment for all users.
Publisher Account Functionality
: (
https://publisher.xsolla.com
) to provide you with supporting emails intended to assist you with project management or to carry out anti-fraud checks on the transactions you perform. For example, we automatically match the information you provide with our databases and use a probability approach to detect fraud.
Payment Method Sorting
: Xsolla utilizes automated decision-making and profiling in a sorting mechanism to offer you the most relevant and convenient payment methods. This mechanism takes into account various parameters, such as your location, payment history, payment amount and more. The goal is to create lists of popular payment methods and a comprehensive catalog of payment systems that cater to your individual needs and preferences.
In all cases, if you are located in the European Union, you have the right to object to an automated decision and to request a manual review based on additional information which you can provide. To exercise this right or for more information, please contact us at
data.protection@xsolla.com
You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.
In all cases, you will be notified of this before we start processing your data for these purposes in the form of a request from Xsolla asking you to give us appropriate consent as applicable.

Children’s
Privacy
IN BRIEF
Are you under 18 years of age? If so, please ask your parents or guardian to read this information. It is important that you understand what this document is about. In brief, it is about how we protect your rights and information and how we interact with you and your parents or guardian in order to sell you a game.
15. Children’s Privacy
Xsolla’s Services are designed for a general audience and are not aimed at children. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) (or other relevant ages, which may apply by virtue of applicable law) through our Services.
Children can purchase digital content and/or physical goods and access services with full, verifiable parental consent.
When a user attempts to make a purchase, we ask them to provide a date of birth. If the user is a minor, they are asked to provide their first name and parent’s email address. We use the parent’s email address to seek consent for the child to make purchases in online games. Parents create an account to manage their children’s purchases. We collect the following information from parents to seek consent for their child to make purchases in Xsolla or use other Services:
First name
Last name
Date of birth
Post/ZIP Code
Country
Parents may also be asked to provide the last four digits of their social security number, a driver’s license or other government ID depending on the verification method chosen.
Xsolla partners with PRIVO, a leading privacy solutions expert and FTC-approved COPPA Safe Harbor, to obtain full, verifiable parental consent. Information collected for verification is stored securely and is not used for any other purpose. For more information on PRIVO and the information it collects to verify you and obtain consent, please see:
https://www.privo.com/platform-privacy-policy
Parents may also provide their child’s email address which will be used to send the child notifications related to their purchases and activity, such as approved or declined purchases. This email address will not be used for any other purpose or shared with any service providers.
We do not use service providers in relation to children when using our payment services and we do not collect any personal information from children. Xsolla generates a user ID in order to associate the purchase request with an existing parent account.
If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 (or relevant age, which may apply by virtue of applicable law) without prior consent, we will promptly erase the information from our records. If you discover that a child has provided Xsolla with their personal data, please contact Xsolla at
data.protection@xsolla.com

EULA
