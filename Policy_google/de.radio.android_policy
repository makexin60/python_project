Further information about the extent of data collection by the Windows Phone Store can be found in the Windows Phone Store's Privacy Policy at https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement.
We collect, process and store your personal data when you access our App.
In order to enable effective use of the App, radio.de collects data about your use of our App in the form of so-called “server log files” (hereinafter also referred to as
“Log Files”
). Each attempt to access our App is therefore logged.
The Log Files generated from this process contain the following data:
- Your IP address;
- Time, type and number of station requests;
- Your mobile operating system.
The collection and processing of information stored in the Log Files will only be used for anonymised analysis for statistical purposes, i.e. to analyse your use of our App and ensure continuous improvement of our services. Such data are not attributable to you as an identified person. This data will not be merged with other data sources.
In order to be able to make full use of the content provided in our App, including in particular audio services, you may create a user profile with us. This gives you the opportunity to create a favourites list of stations and songs that you can retrieve in your user profile. This allows you to access your favourite stations quickly. We can also recommend other stations to you in accordance with your favourites list. You can amend or delete your personal data or favourites lists stated in your user profile at any time. When you create a user profile, we will collect and process the following personal data as the minimum information required:
- Your email address;
- Your user name;
- Your password.
Once you have created a user profile, you will have the option to add additional personal data to your profile on a voluntary basis:
- Your name;
- Your place of residence;
- Your gender;
- Your profile picture.
For certain functions of our App, it is necessary to collect location data regarding specific use of the App in order to be able to offer you functions and services on the App tailored to your location (such as to choose local stations, etc.). Our App therefore uses your IP address in order to determine your rough location. No conclusions can be drawn at any point about your specific location. In order to improve ads from local stations for you, our App may also access the GPS location data from your mobile device, provided you have consented to the collection of location data by granting the corresponding permission to do so on your device. This is done via a pop-up window, which is displayed to you on your mobile device’s screen when using the App. You may grant or withdraw permission to collect location data at any time in your mobile device’s settings. However, radio.de wishes to point out that in doing so it is also possible that certain functions in the App cannot be used or cannot be used in full. In addition, when the App uses your GPS data no conclusions can be drawn at any point about your specific location as the location data determined using GPS are truncated in a technical manner by radio.de.
radio.de will only use the collected location data in order to provide its services. In order to provide certain functions of the App, radio.de must therefore process your IP address and/or GPS data in order to be able to offer you these functions when you use the App. Your location will only be sent to us if, when using the App, you make use of the various functions that radio.de is able to offer you once we know your location. This so-called “geolocalisation”, i.e. the assignment of the opening of the App to the location it is opened, is performed initially using the IP address as the basis, and potentially by determining your location data via GPS as well. The collected geographical information cannot, under any circumstances, be used to determine a user’s specific place of residence. This data will not be merged with other data sources.
If your location is determined by GPS, your mobile device will typically indicate this by using a specific symbol visible on the screen. Your location will be collected, processed and stored by radio.de in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If location data are also transferred to third parties via iOS, Android, BlackBerry or Windows Phone, radio.de does not have any influence on the extent of any such data collection.
When you use the content provided in our App, we will collect and process the following personal data:
- Your user profile, if created, consisting of the minimum information required and any potential additional data;
- Log files;
- Your location.
The legal basis for collecting and processing the data provided by you as specified above is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Please also note the information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy on your rights regarding the protection of your personal data.

Facebook SDK
radio.de uses the Software Development Kit (“SDK”) provided by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (“Facebook”). The Facebook SDK allows us to conduct different forms of analysis regarding the installation of our App and the success of individual advertising campaigns. In addition, a user’s individual activities within the App can be analysed in order to be able to better define the target group for advertising campaigns in a more precise manner. By using the Facebook SDK, we are able to link various services from the “Facebook” social media network to our App. For example, the Facebook SDK allows you to share content from our App within your own Facebook timeline or to send messages to other Facebook users. The legal basis for collecting data is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. To this end, our App sends pseudonymised data to Facebook along with information that the App was started. The Advertising ID (IDFA/AAID) provided by the device’s operating system is therefore used as the pseudonym here. radio.de does not have any influence on the extent of any such data collection. The purpose and scope of the data collection, and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook and your rights and configuration options concerning this to protect your privacy, can be found in Facebook’s privacy policy: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php. Further information on the Facebook SDK for iOS can be found at: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios. You can also prevent the use of your IDFA/AAID. Each iOS and Android device has such a technically encrypted ID, which can be used by developers and advertisers to record activities for advertising purposes. The ID can generally be used by radio.de in order to repeatedly target users with specific campaigns. You can decide on the use of these IDs. You can reset this ID at any time in the settings for your mobile operating system. In addition, you can also disable such use in the settings for your mobile operating system so that radio.de cannot use the IDFA/AAID.
