THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information You Provide to Us
You may choose voluntarily to provide certain personal information to us. Personal information is information from which you can be directly or indirectly identified, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, payment card and financial account information, billing information, driver’s license number, Social Security number, and certain online identifiers.
For example, you may decide to share your first and last name, date of birth, location, email address, phone number, username and password, and the country and state in which you reside when you create an account to log in to our Services ("
Account
"). We need this information to set up your Account, verify your identity, and provide you with our Services. The personal information you provide in connection with Account creation will be collected in accordance with this privacy notice.
When you use our Website, Applications, or other Services, or deposit or withdraw funds, we may collect all information necessary to complete the transaction and provide you with our Services, including your name, address, email address, phone number, credit or debit card number, other financial account and billing information, Social Security number, tax information, and records of the products and Services you purchased, obtained, or considered.
In the event you provide us feedback or contact us via email or chat, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other message content, in order to send you a reply, provide customer and technical support, improve and optimize our Services, satisfy our legal obligations, enforce our contracts and legal rights, and address any existing or anticipated disputes.
We will collect the profile photo you upload and username you choose for your public profile page, including in connection with our social networking features ("
Profile
"), to give you a personalized experience of our Services. When you participate in any DFS contest, Gaming offering, Marketplace transaction, or other product through the Website, Applications, or other Services, other participants may be able to see the information you selected for your Profile.
In the event you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location or by otherwise permitting us to geolocate you), we may store and use that information to verify your eligibility to use certain Services, to comply with relevant laws, and for fraud detection and prevention purposes.
When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional information about your Profile, activity, usage, and preferences related to the Website, Applications, and other Services, so we can evaluate your interest in, and the quality of, our Services and provide you customer and technical support.
In the event you participate in a DraftKings sweepstakes, giveaway, contest, promotion, or game through our Services, we may collect your email address, username, and phone number to notify you in the event you win. We may also ask for consumers’ names and addresses, in order to verify their identities and fulfill any applicable prizes. In some situations we may need to collect other information about user preferences as part of the entry process, such as a prize selection, or in connection with the award of prizes that are valued over a certain dollar amount. Such sweepstakes, giveaways, contests, promotions, and games are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules associated with any sweepstakes, giveaway, contest, promotion, or game before entering.
In the event you use our social networking features, we may collect, and other DraftKings users may be able to see, your Profile information, including your username, real name, photo, location, the content you post on your social feed and the social feeds of other DraftKings users, and any other information you choose to upload or share. We may also collect, and other users may also be able to see, information about the DFS contests, Gaming offerings, and Marketplace transactions you participate in, including, but not limited to, contest entry fees, wagers and betting feed data, and contest lineups. In the event you elect to sync, upload, or import data about your contacts from your device’s address book, we may collect and use that information to provide you and your contacts with our Services, including, but not limited to, helping you find and connect with your contacts and helping your contacts connect with you. In general, the information you choose to provide when using our social networking features is public, and you should exercise caution and good judgment before you post, upload, sync, import, or otherwise share information with us and others in order to avoid disclosing sensitive, harmful, or unlawful information. You are solely responsible for the content you post, upload, or share and other information you provide, whether by syncing, importing, uploading, or otherwise, when you choose to use our social networking features. You may control the information you share or upload through our social networking features by using our social privacy settings. The social privacy settings allow you to determine: who is able to see your Profile and your DFS and Gaming activity through our social networking features; who can add you as a friend; who can find you in a username search; who is able to see your real name and friends lists; whether you will receive notifications of replies and reactions to your posts; whether you will receive notifications that someone has posted content to your feed or posted about you; and who can see your posts.
Information Collected Via Technology
Information Collected by our Services.
In order to improve, personalize, and optimize our Services and meet our legal obligations, we may automatically track certain information about your visits to and usage of our Website, Applications, and other Services, including your browser type, operating system, Internet protocol (IP) address, device identifier, domain name, clickstream data, referring/exist pages, geolocation data, and a date/time stamp for your visits. We also use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, gather demographic information about our user base, deliver advertising, perform research, provide technical and customer support, inform our product development efforts, protect our legal rights, address disputes, and prevent our Services from being used to commit harmful or unlawful activities, including fraud. Some of this information may also be collected so that when you use the Website, Applications, or other Services again, we will be able to recognize you and optimize your experience accordingly.
Device Information.
We may collect information about the devices you use to access our Services, including the hardware models, operating systems and versions, software, file names and versions, preferred languages, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial numbers, device motion information, and mobile network information. In the event you have downloaded our Application(s), we may also collect certain information from your mobile device, including information about how you use the Application(s). This information is generally used to help us deliver relevant information to you and to detect and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity. In the event our Application crashes on your mobile device, we will also receive information about your mobile device model, software version, and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs, provide other technical support, and improve and optimize the performance of our Applications.
Like many online services, we use “cookies” to collect technical information. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience of our Website, Applications, and other Services. We may use cookies to collect information about your IP address, browser type, operating system, device type and identifiers, platform type, as well as your usage of and activity on our Website and Applications and the performance of our Services. These types of information are collected to make the Website and Applications more useful to you and to tailor your online experience to meet your interests and expectations. You can use the options in your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or you may change your cookie preferences in your internet browser or with third parties. You can control and/or delete cookies used by our Services at any time. You can delete all existing cookies on your computer and adjust settings for most browsers to prevent cookies from being received.
Pixel Tags.
In addition, we use "pixel tags" (also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive or web browser, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies, to trigger the placing of cookies, and/or to transmit information to us or our vendors or partners. This enables two websites to share information. The resulting connection can include information such as a device’s IP address, the time a person viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with a browser or device, the type of browser being used, and the URL of the web page from which the pixel was viewed. Pixel tags also allow us to send email messages in a format that users can read, tell us whether emails have been opened, and help to ensure we are sending only messages that may be of interest to our consumers. We may also use information collected through pixel tags to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
Threat Detection.
We use certain service providers, such as ThreatMetrix, to provide threat detection, user authentication, and fraud prevention services. These service providers may automatically collect certain information about your visits to the Website and Applications, as well as the device you use to connect to our Services, in order to monitor for potential threats and bad actors. This information may include, among other things, your IP address and your device’s unique identifiers. In the event you would like to know more about ThreatMetrix’s data privacy practices, please review the
LexisNexis ThreatMetrix Processing Notice
.
Collection of Data in Connection with Advertising and Marketing.
We may use certain vendors or partners to serve ads on our Services, as well as on other websites, applications, and social media networks. In connection with the delivery of advertising, certain vendors, including, but not limited to, Facebook, FantasyPros, LiveRamp, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, The Trade Desk, TruSignal, and Twitter, may collect information about you and your visits to the Website and Applications and other websites and applications. That information may include your IP address, internet service provider, unique personal identifiers (e.g., email address), and the browser you use to visit the Website and Applications and other websites and applications. They may do this by using cookies, pixel tags, or other technologies. The information collected may be used, among other purposes, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand your usage of, preferences on, and visitation of our Website, Applications and other Services as well as other sites, social media networks, and applications tracked by such vendors or partners. This notice does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies used in connection with other parties’ ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and ad services to learn about their use of such technologies. In the event you would like more information about these practices to understand your options for not having your information collected and used by such companies, please click
http://www.aboutads.info/choices
and
https://www.networkadvertising.org/
.
We may also display interest-based ads, sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, using the information you make available to us when you interact with the Website, Applications, and other Services.
Measurement Data and Third-Party Analytics.
We use a number of vendors and service providers, such as, but not limited to, Google, Hulu, and Roku to help analyze and measure how people use our Services ("
Analytics Companies
"). Analytics Companies may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to collect information pertaining to how people use our Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they may have used prior to using our Services. We use the information we get from Analytics Companies to improve and optimize our Website, Applications, and other Services and to measure the effectiveness of our ads.
Referral Affiliates.
We may enter into agreements with companies that refer users to our Services via hyperlinks available on the referring party’s website. We may automatically collect certain information, such as your IP address, other identifiers, and the identity of the referring website via cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies that are provided to us in connection with your use of the referring party’s website.
Location Information.
We may collect your location information, including your geolocation records, for purposes of verifying whether you are eligible to participate in a DFS contest, Gaming offering, Marketplace transaction, sweepstakes, promotion, or giveaway or to determine whether you are otherwise permitted to use our Services. We may also use such information to comply with our legal obligations, protect our legal rights, and address existing or anticipated disputes.
Information Collected From or About Friends
Refer-a-Friend.
Our Services enable you to invite your friends to join in the fun. We offer several ways to invite friends to play on the Website and Applications. All options include the use of a unique URL link provided to you by us that you must use to direct people who do not have an existing Account to the Website and Applications to become a referred friend (“
Link
”). You may share the Link with friends via email, text, Facebook, Twitter, and other ways. When a friend uses the Link to register an Account on DraftKings, the Link enables us to associate that friend with the referrer, primarily for the purpose of awarding bonuses. The Link and the terms and conditions of the Refer-a-Friend program are available through
DraftKings Refer a Friend Terms
. We also employ techniques to facilitate invitations to friends using the Link, including a contact importer tool that allows you to add your contacts, including those in your address book, so that you can ask them to join DraftKings and communicate with you through the Website, Applications, and other Services. Our contact importer tool may not be available to users in certain regions or countries. In the event it is available, with your permission, we will access your address book and import your contacts' names, email addresses, phone numbers, locations, and associated details to determine which of your friends have not registered an Account on DraftKings. We rely upon you to obtain any consents from your friends and contacts that may be required by law to allow us to access, upload, and use their data for this purpose. You or your friends or contacts may reach us at
privacy@draftkings.com
to request the removal of this information from our database.
Find-a-Friend.
Our Services may also enable you to invite your friends who already have an Account to participate in our Services. In order to invite friends with Accounts to join in the Services, you may: (i) enter your friend's username associated with their Account to find and locate them; or (ii) in the event you are using our Application(s), use our contact importer tool to import and search through your contacts, including contacts in your address book, to match those of your friends who are also registered DraftKings users. Our contact importer tool may not be available to users in certain regions and countries. In the event it is available, with your permission, we will access your address book and import your contacts' names, email addresses, phone numbers, location, and associated information to facilitate the connection with your friends. Again, it is your responsibility to obtain any consents from your friends and contacts that may be required by law to allow us to access, upload, and use their personal information for this purpose.

In the event you at any time believe the personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate, you may request that we amend such personal information.
How To Submit Requests to Access, Delete, or Correct Your Personal Information.
You may submit a request to access, delete, or correct your personal information by emailing us at
privacy@draftkings.com
. Please note that we may deny or fulfill a request only in part based on our legal rights and obligations. Please also note that, as a regulated entity, we may be required to retain numerous categories of personal information for periods prescribed by law, which may often span several years. In the event we deny a request or part of a request, we will provide information about the reason for the denial. In the event you wish to temporarily or permanently close your Account, please email us at
support@draftkings.com
.
When we receive a request, we will take reasonable steps to verify the identity of the requestor in accordance with applicable law. In the event the requestor has a password-protected Account with us, we may verify their identity through our existing authentication practices and may require the requestor to re-authenticate themselves before disclosing, correcting, or deleting the Account holder’s data. In the event a requestor does not have a password-protected Account, we will take reasonable steps to verify their identity in accordance with applicable law prior to responding to a request. The verification steps may vary depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and the region where the requestor is located. In the event we cannot verify a requestor’s identity using these methods, we may use an appropriate third-party verification service.

HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
Various browsers, including, but not limited to, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari, currently offer a “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. Please note that, at this time, we do not honor “DNT” signals or other mechanisms that may allow you to opt out of the collection of information across networks of websites and online services, as there is no standard for how online services should respond to such signals. As standards evolve, we may develop policies for responding to DNT signals that would be described in future versions of this notice. For more information on DNT options, please visit
www.allaboutdnt.org

You may submit a request to access, delete, or correct your personal information by emailing us at
privacy@draftkings.com
. Please review
Section 7
for more information.
Designating an Authorized Agent to Submit Privacy Requests.
CA Consumers may use an authorized agent to submit requests to access, delete, or correct their personal information. An authorized agent is a person or entity registered with the California Secretary of State that a CA Consumer has authorized to act on their behalf. In the event you choose to submit a privacy request to us through an authorized agent, we may require that you provide the agent with written permission to do so and that the agent verify their own identity with us. In the event your privacy request is submitted by an agent without proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf, we may deny the request.
“Shine the Light” Law.
A CA Consumer who has provided personal information to a business with whom they have established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, in the event the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request from a CA Consumer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists in the event the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy notice) a policy of not disclosing CA Consumer’s personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes unless the business gives users a mechanism to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the CA Consumer of their right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost-free means to exercise the right.
We have opted for this alternative approach. As stated in this notice, we give CA Consumers a mechanism to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes. In the event you wish to opt out of sharing your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please see the instructions in
Section 7
for how to opt out.

PART I. GENERAL INFORMATION AND KEY TERMS
Who we are
Sift is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company based in San Francisco, California. We help our Customers detect and address fraud and other illegal or malicious behavior on their Customer Sites and in other contexts using our proprietary real-time machine learning technology.
In doing so, we need to collect and process information about our Customers’ End Users. Our cloud-based machine learning platform uses this information to predict and prevent fraudulent and other illegal or malicious activity in real time.
We offer four core products and related support and knowledge sharing services:
Payment Protection
(reduces fraudulent payments),
Account Defense
(reduces fake account creation and prevents bad actors from accessing trust-worthy accounts),
Content Integrity
(protects Customer Sites from malicious content) and
Dispute Management
(helps Customers manage chargebacks). You can find out more about these offerings
here.
How the Sift Services work
Customers provide us with data and information about End Users and their interactions with the applicable Customer Sites through our Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and other integrations. We may receive this information directly from our Customers or from their service providers and partners. In addition, we collect data directly from End Users through standard tracking technologies (like our JavaScript code or SDK), which our Customers can embed on their Customer Sites. We refer to all of this data as “Customer Data” – as described in
Part II
below.
We then process the Customer Data through our cloud-based machine learning platform to return a relative fraud score, which is a numerical indicator of the likelihood of fraud or illegal activity for a particular event on the Customer Site (e.g., a purchase transaction, the posting of content, creation of a profile). This involves extracting and deriving the most useful features of the Customer Data, based on new and existing fraud patterns,
and identifying connections among data attributes across our entire Customer network
. For our Dispute Management product, we process Customer Data to create a dispute win rate which (similar to the fraud score) is a numerical indicator of the likelihood of winning a particular chargeback. In addition to the fraud scores and win rates, we provide our Customers with supporting evidence, and aggregated reporting and insights across the entire network to highlight potential illegal acts or security threats.
The data we provide to Customers, including fraud scores, dispute win rates and supporting evidence, and aggregated insights across our network, are used by Customers to assist them in identifying and preventing fraudulent activity on their Customer Sites and managing chargeback disputes. This information may also be used by certain Customers to support their legal or regulatory reporting obligations and risk management procedures (e.g., in relation to their anti-money laundering (AML) or know your customer (KYC) requirements). It is up to Customers to decide what action to take or not to take using the information we provide. For example, depending on the rules set by our Customers, transactions or activities with certain scores may be required to complete further authentication, flagged for the Customer’s review, or blocked. Typically, however, the transaction or activity will proceed with no issues. Customers also provide us with ongoing feedback on the accuracy of the scores by reviewing the activity on their Customer Sites, which in turn improves our proprietary modeling and algorithms. For more information on how our fraud services work, please email
privacy@sift.com
.
We also may provide security notification and verification features (including two-factor authentication) as part of our Account Defense product. To provide these features, we use certain Customer Data provided by our Customers to send notifications to End Users (such as via text, messages or emails), including to notify End Users of login attempts and account activity, or to send verification codes to End Users,which they enter on the Customer Sites to confirm their identity when logging in or creating a new account.
PART II. WHAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
(A) END USERS
Information We Collect About End Users
Information provided by our Customers:
Our Customers decide the type of Customer Data they wish to send to Sift for analysis within the Sift Services. Our solutions and support teams work closely with Customers to assess the utility of the specific Customer Data they send to us. For example, Sift guides Customers as to whether a particular data type (e.g., billing method) may be relevant in assessing the particular activity (e.g., likelihood of stolen payment credentials). While it will depend on the specific product offering and Customer relationship, the Customer Data that Customers typically send to us through our integrations include:
Contact details
(such as your email address, postal address, phone number, and user login);
Information about your device
(such as your IP address, session ID, mobile/desktop device properties, and metadata);
Account activity information
(such as account login attempts and failures, when you’ve reset your password, and other information about your behavior on a Customer Site);
Transaction information
(such as information about items you’ve purchased, currency codes, billing method, invoice details, and partial credit card information);
Customer Site communication information
(such as feedback, messaging, Customer support communications, reviews or images you may have provided on or within Customer Sites);
KYC-related information
(such as information about whether a KYC check was initiated by the Customer and the result of the check); and
Dispute-related information
(such as dispute case number, dispute ID, dispute stage and status, merchant ID, and whether a chargeback was issued or an order was cancelled)
Information we automatically collect when you visit Customer Sites:
As further explained below, we use certain standard tracking technologies to automatically collect certain information about your device when you interact with and use Customer Sites. Some of this information (including, for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be
considered “personal information” or
“personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the EU. Depending on whether you visit a Customer Site via an app or a webpage, the information we collect includes:
Browser and device information,
such as the device type and model, manufacturer, operating system type and version (e.g. iOS or Android), web browser type and version (e.g., Chrome or Safari), user-agent, carrier name/code and country code, time zone, the network connection type, IP address, hardware-based identifiers (e.g. MAC address), host name, device identifiers (such as iOS Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), Android/Google Advertising ID (AAID or GAID)), canvas fingerprint, characteristics related to emulation or rooted (such as if your device is “jailbroken”), and app name and version. We also collect character set, host name, language, page title and URL, referrer URL, number of fonts, fonts hash, number of plugins, plugins hash, screen height and width, color depth, platform, cookie footprint, maximum touch points, JavaEnabled, session storage, local storage, whether the resolution has been tampered, language or OS, whether ad blocking is enabled, whether do not track is enabled, flash socket IP and flash identifier. The SDK will also collect phone-related metadata (battery level, device properties, carrier name); and
Information about an End User’s behavior on Customer’s Sites,
such as information about the activities on those Customer Sites, session ID, session start/stop time, timezone offset, and location information which may be general location information inferred from your IP address or, in some circumstances, more precise geolocation information based on latitude and longitude coordinates. You may be able to control the collection of location information through particular Customer Sites by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
Information we collect from third party sources:
We may receive some of the information above from our Customer’s service providers or partners (such as, their payment processors, customer support providers or KYC providers), as directed by our Customer. We also combine or enhance the information we collect about you with limited information we receive from third parties. For example, we receive information such as whether an IP address is commercial or private, whether a phone number is a landline, whether an email domain is free, or the issuing bank associated with a transaction. We also work with a small number of providers that match information from social media with End Users’ email addresses provided to us, or provide us with a human-readable, mapped location based on a physical address or latitude/longitude.
How We Use End User Information and the Legal Bases
Sift uses information about End Users to provide, maintain, improve, and develop the Sift Services and to comply with our legal obligations.
For example, we process personal information through our cloud-based machine learning platform to return fraud scores to our Customers for particular events or activities on the Customer Site and to return win rates for particular chargeback disputes. Additionally, we process personal information to identify connections among data attributes across our Customer network and to generate aggregated reporting and insights. We also process personal information to optimize and improve the Sift Services (for example, to train our proprietary models and algorithms so that we can more effectively detect fraudulent behaviors
and ensure the accuracy and integrity of our models and algorithms
). In addition, when our Customers use the Sift security notification and two-factor authentication features, we process personal information, such as their End Users’ telephone number or email address, to notify End Users of login attempts and account activity and send a verification code to End Users via text message or email. This allows our Customers who use these features to identify suspicious logins and validate their End Users’ identities when they log into the Customer Sites or create a new account.
Finally, we may also process personal information to validate the identity of End Users seeking to exercise their privacy rights.
We base our processing of your personal information on: (i) our legitimate interests in operating the Sift Services, including to better detecting and preventing fraud, security threats, and other illegal or malicious behavior on Customer Sites; and (ii) our (and our Customers) legitimate interest in combating fraud, maintaining safe online experiences for our Customers and their End Users and reducing the costs associated with invalid or fraudulent chargebacks. In some cases, we may also need to process your personal data to comply with our legal obligations.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, including any legitimate interests relied upon, please contact us as provided under the
How to contact us
section at the end of this Notice.
How We Use Tracking Technologies to Collect Information about End Users
We use standard tracking technologies to automatically collect certain information (as described in the
Information We Collect About End Users
section) from your device and/or browser when you visit or interact with Customer Sites.
We use the following tracking technologies:
JS Snippet:
A JavaScript code (
“JS Snippet”
), also called a tag or pixel, is a tiny snippet of code inserted into the content of the Customer Site. You can disable JavaScript by changing the settings on your browser. Information about the procedure to follow to change the settings can usually be found on your internet browser provider’s website via your help screen. Because Sift does not control these settings, we encourage you to check the information provided about them on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.
Mobile “SDKs” or “Software Development Kits”:
These are blocks of code that are embedded into a Customer Site that allow Sift to collect certain information as further described above. You can control the use of certain information Sift collects through the SDK by following the instructions applicable to your mobile device operating system, which are usually available in your mobile device settings. This typically means that you will no longer be associated with your old device ID or the information collected about you when the old device ID was assigned to you. However, if the Customer Site you visit requires you to login (e.g., via an email address), Sift will associate a new device ID with your login and your new and old device IDs will be associated. You may also be able to control the collection of location information by particular Customer Sites by changing the preferences on your mobile device. Because Sift does not control these settings, we encourage you to check the information provided about them on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.
Canvas Fingerprinting:
We use canvas fingerprinting, which is a tracking technique that allows us to render graphic images from built-in features of HTML5 Canvas in your browser. The canvas image is often rendered differently on different devices because of a number of factors (such as, your web browser version, operating system and its settings, and installed graphics hardware), and this will allow us to distinguish you from other End Users. If you would like to disable canvas fingerprinting, you may choose to disable JavaScript or download a browser extension that blocks canvas fingerprinting techniques; however doing so may impair the functionality of the Sift Services. Because Sift does not control these settings or extensions, we encourage you to check the information provided about them on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.
When an End User views or uses a Customer Site, Sift servers are notified, and we are able to collect information from the browser or application as described above.
Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
Sift employs profiling techniques to detect and prevent fraud, security threats and other illegal or malicious behavior on Customer Sites. This includes collecting and analyzing information about End User interactions and behavior across our entire Customer network, and establishing connections between these interactions by linking common data attributes. This also includes using Customer Data to train Sift’s global models that understand fraud patterns across our network of Customers, and custom models that are tailored to specific Customer businesses. As a result, profiling not only assists with immediate fraud prevention but plays a crucial role in the development and improvement of Sift’s fraud detection systems, including to ensure the ongoing accuracy and integrity of our models and algorithms.
Automated decision-making refers to decisions that are made automatically on the basis of computer determinations (using software algorithms), without human review or intervention
, and that result in legal or
significant
effects.
While the services we provide to our Customers
do not generally involve automated decision-making, there are limited circumstances where a Customer’s use of the Sift Services may result in such decisions
being made by our Customers about an action you have taken on a Customer Site. For example, the Customer may use the analysis we provide them to automatically pause the completion of an activity or transaction based on rules the Customer has set or
to automatically challenge a particular chargeback. In such instances, you may be required to take further steps (e.g., two factor authentication), you may potentially be unable to complete a transaction, or your chargeback may be disputed by the Customer
.
Our Customers decide how to use the scores and insights that we provide them. They set and control the thresholds for any automated actions, which may depend on factors like the Customer’s industry, business objectives and risk tolerance. By providing information to Customers, our aim is to empower them to make informed decisions. If you want to learn more about how a business you interact with uses Sift, or you want to contest a decision that’s been made by a business that uses Sift, we encourage you to reach out to that online business to assist you.
(B) AUTHORIZED USERS
Information We Collect About Authorized Users
Information you provide to us when you use the Sift Services:

Provide the Sift Services:
We base our processing of your personal information on our legitimate interests to operate and administer the Sift Services. For example, to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, allow you to share knowledge about the Sift Services with us and our support community, and operate and maintain the Sift Services;
Promote the security of the Sift Services:
We process your personal information by tracking use of the Sift Services, creating aggregated, non-personal information, verifying accounts and activity, monitoring suspicious or fraudulent activity, and enforcing our terms and policies, to the extent this is necessary for our legitimate interest in promoting the safety and security of the Sift Services, systems, and applications and in protecting our rights and the rights of others;
To improve and develop the Sift Services:
We use your personal information (including Usage Data as described in the
Information We Collect About Authorized Users
section) to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and improvement of the Sift Services so that we continually improve the Sift Services, including adding new features or capabilities that make the Sift Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and more useful to our Customers and their Authorized Users to the extent it is necessary for our legitimate interests in developing and improving the Sift Services, or where we seek your consent;
To communicate with you about the Sift Services:
We may send you service, technical, and other administrative or transactional emails, messages, and other types of notifications to in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering the Sift Services. These communications are considered part of the Sift Services and in most cases you cannot opt-out of them.

To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:
Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests, and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger, or sale of a business; and
With your consent:
We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Sift Services with your permission.
(C) SHARING INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
We may share and disclose information about End Users and Authorized Users in the following circumstances:
Vendors, consultants and other service providers
We may share your information with third party vendors, contractors, consultants, and other service providers who provide data processing services to us and with whom the sharing of such information is necessary to undertake that work. If you are an Authorized User, examples of the type of service providers include: processing billing, providing customer support, identity verification, or hosting our infrastructure. We may use providers who assist us in delivering online and offline marketing optimizations. If you are an End User, examples of these types of service providers include: hosting our infrastructure, security notification and verification services (including two factor authentication services), assisting with manual review and for data enrichment purposes (described below).
Our Customers and their vendors, service providers and other intermediaries
We may share your information with our Customers, as well as our Customers’ vendors, service providers, and other third parties acting under their direction, where such sharing is necessary to provide the Sift Services and fulfill the Customer’s request. For example, if you are an End User we may share your information with our Customers’ payment processors or the issuing or acquiring bank involved in a chargeback.
Third-party vendor integrations
We may offer Customers the ability to use third party vendor integrations through our Services. If you choose to use these third party vendor integrations, then you are directly interacting with that third party vendor and providing or directing us to provide information, including personal information, to them for purposes of facilitating the integration.
Data enrichment providers
We may share certain Customer Data (e.g., email addresses) with select third-party service providers (e.g., location data providers or identity verification providers) for data enrichment purposes. Enriching data allows us to make more informed fraud risk assessments. For example, we may work with providers that match information from social media with End Users’ email addresses provided to us, that provide us with a human-readable, mapped location based on a physical address or latitude/longitude. Sift requires that any information disclosed to a provider is used only to perform their service and not for any incompatible purpose, and only as allowed by applicable law.
Professional advisors
We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services they render to us.
Compliance with laws
We may disclose your information to any competent law enforcement body, regulator, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person (see below).
Vital interests and legal rights
We may disclose information about you if we believe it necessary to protect the vital interests or legal rights of Sift, you or any other person.
Corporate affiliates and transactions
We may provide your information to our affiliates (meaning any subsidiary, parent company or company under common control with Sift). Our affiliates will use your information only for the purposes described in this Notice. Additionally, if Sift is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be shared or transferred as part of that transaction, as permitted by law.
PART III. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION
Processing of personal information in the US and other territories
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed by Sift in, countries other than the country in which you are resident, including the United States, Ukraine and other countries around the world where Sift, its affiliates, service providers or partners operate facilities. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and may not provide for the same level of protection as your jurisdiction. However, regardless of where your data is processed, we take steps to ensure that your personal information will be processed in accordance with this Notice and the requirements of applicable law.
European data transfers
If you are located in the
European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), United Kingdom (“
UK
”), or
Switzerland, we will protect your personal information when it is transferred outside of your jurisdiction by: (i) processing it in a territory that provides an adequate level of protection for personal information based on the receiving country’s data protection laws; and/or (ii) implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, such as requiring the recipient to comply with the Standard Contractual Clauses, or another lawful and approved transfer mechanism.
PART IV. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
Depending on your location and subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights with regard to personal information we control about you:
Access, review, correct, or delete your information

Specifically, we (or our third party service provider acting on our behalf) may need to collect a copy of your photo ID and any other information necessary to confirm your identity. Such information will be securely processed in accordance with this Notice and only used for the purpose of verifying your identity.
Please note that, in certain circumstances, your ability to access or control your personal information may be limited, as required or permitted by applicable laws. For example, Sift may be required by law to retain and continue processing your personal information after a deletion request, for example where such processing is necessary to maintain the accuracy and integrity of our models and algorithms so that we can more effectively detect fraudulent behaviors or assist with chargeback disputes within the permissible timeframe.
European Privacy Rights: EEA, UK, and Switzerland
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“

Withdrawal of consent
: If
we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. To withdraw your consent to any processing, please  email
privacy@sift.com
or submit a request via our
web form
.
Right to complain to a data protection authority:
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA and UK are available

U.S. State Law Rights
Certain U.S. states have passed laws extending certain privacy rights to their residents, including California, Colorado, Virginia, Utah and other states.
If you are an Authorized User and a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon,
Tennessee
, Texas, Utah or Virginia, please review our
Supplemental U.S. State Law Privacy Notice
, which describes certain disclosures and rights available to you under your state’s privacy laws, when such laws are effective.
When we handle personal information in providing the Sift Services to our Customers, we do so as a
“service provider” under the CCPA  or “processor”  under the other state privacy laws set forth above
on behalf of our Customers (who are “businesses” under the CCPA and “controllers”
under the other state privacy laws
), to assist them in protecting against security threats or detecting illegal, criminal, malicious or fraudulent activity. When requested, we reasonably assist our Customers in responding to consumer requests under these U.S. state privacy laws. If you are an End User, please direct any requests regarding your U.S. state privacy law rights to the businesses you believe may have collected (or transferred to Sift) your information, so that those businesses or controllers can properly instruct us in whether and in how to assist them in responding.
Unsubscribe from our mailing list
You may at any time ask us to stop sending marketing communications to you, including by clicking “Unsubscribe” in any e-mail communications we send you. If you have any questions in relation to the “Unsubscribe” process, please feel free to get in touch via the contact details set out below. If you choose to no longer receive marketing information, we may still communicate with you regarding such things as your security updates, product functionality, responses to service requests, or other transactional, non-marketing/administrative related purposes.
PART V. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Security safeguards
We use technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal information processed as part of the Sift Services against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Data retention
We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so and for a period of time consistent with the original purpose as described in this Notice. We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal information processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
After expiration of the applicable retention periods, we will either delete or anonymize your personal information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Changes to this Notice
We may revise this Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments, and the revised version will be effective when it is posted. If we make any material changes to the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you, we will prominently post the updated version here and in our discretion notify you and/or the Customer by email or by other reasonable means. You can see when this Notice was last updated by checking the “last updated” or “effective” date displayed at the top of this Notice.

Our Privacy Policies
This Privacy Policy explains how Onfido, an Entrust company, (“we”, “us”, “our”) uses personal information about our clients’ users, and others, to provide our Identity Services on behalf of our clients. Users located in the US should also refer to
Onfido’s Facial Scan and Voice Recording Policy
which takes priority over the information below to the extent there is any inconsistency or ambiguity.
If you are looking for details of the personal information we collect in other circumstances, please see the relevant policy listed below:
Our
Website and B2B Privacy Policy
explains how we collect, use, and otherwise process personal information of people who visit our websites or otherwise interact with Onfido in a business to business capacity.
Our
Cookie and SDK Policy
contains information about the cookies we use, why we use them, and your privacy choices regarding cookies.
If you are a candidate applying for a role at Onfido, please see the Candidate Privacy Policy displayed in our Application Portal.
Please note that if you are a resident of California, Onfido’s California Privacy Notice does not apply to our use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy because when we use information to provide our Identity Services, we use this information as a service provider on behalf of a client. The client, as the business, may have additional obligations under California law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, and we suggest you review their privacy policy for further details.
1. This Privacy Policy
At Onfido, we’re simplifying digital identity for everyone. We help our clients to verify their users so they can access their services quickly, easily and - most important of all - securely. When we verify an identity, carry out checks related to an identity, or provide user authentication services (our “
Identity Services
”), we’re committed to protecting the privacy and security of that identity.
When we process your personal information so we can provide Identity Services to a client, we are acting on the client’s behalf as their service provider and processor. The section below headed “
The Information We Collect and How We Use It On Behalf Of Our Clients
” explains what we do with this information, but if you are a user of an Onfido client you should review the client’s privacy policy for full information about how your personal information is collected and used.
As well as handling your personal information on behalf of a client in order to provide Identity Services to them, we may also handle your personal information on our own behalf as a controller. For example, we may use the personal information that we collect when providing our Identity Services, and personal information that is publicly available, to develop and improve our Identity Services. For information about how we use personal information as a controller, please see the section of this Privacy Policy headed “
Using Information As Controller
.”
We may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will publish those changes before they come into effect and notify our clients so they can consider whether to update their own policies and notify their users.
2. The Information We Collect and How We Use It On Behalf Of Our Clients
To provide our Identity Services to a client, we collect certain personal information about the client’s users.
Our
clients
are organizations that have asked Onfido to verify someone’s identity, or to carry out checks related to their identity.
Our clients’
users
are the individuals whose identities a client has asked us to verify or otherwise check.
We may collect personal information about a user from the client, from the user, or from third party data providers (“Data Providers”). Data Providers are trusted third party service providers or public authorities who provide additional information depending on the Identity Service a client has chosen to use.
The following paragraphs provide details of the personal information we collect on behalf of a client depending on which of our Identity Services the client chooses to use. If you are in the EEA or UK, our client is responsible for identifying a legal basis which permits your personal information to be used for the purposes described below; you should review their privacy policy for further details.
Document Checks
Onfido’s
document checks
verify identity documents from across the globe by analyzing an image or video of the document. Our system extracts information from the image/video or, if possible, from the security chip embedded in the document. Our models analyze the authenticity of the document, which may include machine-readable zones, barcodes, QR codes, and security chips, to verify whether the document is genuine or shows signs of tampering. We will also compare the image or video of the identity document with information about compromised identities that have been leaked or otherwise made publicly available.
Information collected: personal information extracted from a user’s identity document, for example name, document number, date of birth, nationality, type of document, issuing country, expiration date, information embedded in barcodes, QR codes, security chips and features (which will vary depending on the type of document), and the image metadata associated with the image or video of the document.
Important: If you are a user living in the Netherlands, please be advised that Onfido may automatically mask your
BSN number
on your identity document in our back-end systems when required under Dutch law, and particularly the Dutch Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act.
Biometric Checks and Authentication
When providing
biometric checks
as part of our Identity Services, we’ll ask for an image or video (including an audio recording) of a user’s face (a “
Selfie
”), as well as an image or video to use as a reference image (for example, an image of their identity document). We generate two scans of the user’s face (one from the Selfie, and one from the reference image) and we compare those two scans to assess whether the person in the Selfie is likely to be the same person pictured in the reference image. Additionally, as part of our Identity Services, we will also evaluate the authenticity of the images and videos (including audio recordings) and identity documents, including detecting whether there is a genuine human or physical document in your photos/videos, and identifying signs of tampering, coercion or social engineering.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy under the section below headed “Fraud checks, including device integrity and fraud signals”, when performing biometric checks we do not store the extracted face scans once the check is complete. Where a client has asked us to provide an authentication service, the client may ask Onfido to store a reference image chosen by the client for each relevant user. (This image is retained in accordance with retention periods set by the client and subject to any maximum retention periods specified by Onfido or in applicable laws.) When Onfido is asked to authenticate a user, we will generate two face scans - one using a new image of the user and one using the reference image we have stored. If the two images match, the authentication is confirmed. Clients who wish to use an authentication service without the need for Onfido to store a reference image can choose to store an encrypted version of the face scan relating to a reference image themselves (including on the user’s device). When Onfido is asked to authenticate a user, we will be given access to the stored face scan and we will compare it to a new face scan that we generate using a new image of the user. If the two images match, the authentication is confirmed.
Information collected: images or videos (including audio recordings) of a user and/or of their identity document, metadata extracted from those images or videos, and data extracted from those images or videos that may be construed as a scan of face geometry or a voiceprint and which may be considered to be biometric identifiers or biometric information by applicable US biometric privacy laws. Users located in the US should refer to
Onfido’s Facial Scan and Voice Recording Policy
for details.
Data Verification
Onfido provides clients with
data verification
checks via a network of trusted Data Providers (defined above) and our own internal checks. These checks enable clients to verify their users, detect fraud and comply with anti money laundering (AML) and Know Your Client (KYC) requirements. We conduct these checks by comparing personal information provided by the client or the user with information held by Data Providers or information extracted from documents, e.g. a utility bill for
proof of address
checks. Our global network of data verification services varies depending on a user's location and includes voter and driving license registers and other government databases, police databases, consumer credit agencies, sanctions and Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists, adverse media sources, utility companies, mobile network providers and other trusted commercial sources. At the request of a client, these services may be provided on an ongoing basis, for example where a client’s regulatory obligations require ongoing monitoring against sanction and PEP lists.
Information collected: the information collected will vary depending on the availability of checks in the user’s location and the Identity Services selected by Onfido’s clients. It may include contact details such as postal address, email address, telephone number, social security number or other national identity number, information extracted from a utility bill a user uploads or other information provided by the Data Provider e.g. a user’s mobile network operator, publicly available information from media searches, sanctions and PEP lists.
Fraud checks, including device integrity and fraud signals
Onfido leverages a number of different
fraud detection
capabilities. Some of these depend on the scope of the Identity Services selected by Onfido’s clients, whereas other fraud checks are applied across all of the above services. For example, Onfido will analyze the metadata associated with the user’s Selfie and the image or video of their identity document (to identify whether any editing software can be detected) to assess the likelihood that the user is genuine.
Onfido can also help clients to determine whether a device, email address or phone number has previously been used in relation to suspected fraudulent activity, shows unusual usage patterns, has been manipulated or otherwise indicates that the user may not be genuine. At a client’s request, Onfido and our Data Providers may collect ‘passive signals’ from the client (for example mobile number or email address) or a user’s device as they engage with the client’s website or app or Onfido’s Identity Services. Such information may include device identifiers, IP address, information about the device (for example the operating system used, whether the device is providing false randomized device and network information or has otherwise been compromised) and how the user interacts with it. Together this information helps Onfido and our Data Providers assess the likelihood of you being a genuine user, assign a risk score and infer certain information such as your broad geographical location from your IP address.
At a client’s request, we can also check whether we have previously verified a user on behalf of that client by comparing the information submitted as part of a new Document Check and/or Biometric Check, to information we have previously verified for that client. (More specifically, at a client’s request we will retain information (including face scans depending on the service the client has chosen to use) extracted from a user’s identity document or Selfie, and compare this retained information to the newly submitted information. As explained further below, clients determine how long we retain the extracted information). This helps our client not only verify users’ identities but further protects them and their users from fraud by helping clients understand when a user may be generating multiple identities, editing and tampering with documents or manipulating device or network information.
Information collected: the information collected will vary depending on the availability of checks in the user’s location and the Identity Services selected by Onfido’s clients. It may include: the information listed in the Document Check and/or Biometric Check sections above; data extracted from images or videos of identity documents that may be construed as a scan of face geometry and which may be considered to be biometric identifiers or biometric information by applicable US biometric privacy laws (users located in the US should refer to
Onfido’s Facial Scan and Voice Recording Policy
for details); mobile number, email address, IP address, device details including device identifiers and other information about the user’s device and how they are interacting with our Identity Services (for example we may collect information about the upload time, which version of our software was used, the camera name and model used to capture any images and whether there are any indicators that the device has been tampered with or emulated). We may also analyze how the user is interacting with their device to assess the likelihood of of the user being a genuine user and who they say they are, for example
fraudsters
will cut and paste large volumes of information from their clipboard, use this functionality multiple times and otherwise navigate between applications on their device very differently from a genuine user. Onfido and our Data Providers may also use such information to infer other information about the user, for example their broad geographical location from their IP address, or to calculate an identity risk score to assist clients in determining whether the user is a genuine user.
Onfido Reports and Automated Decision Making
Once we have verified an identity or run a check, we share the results with the client in a report (“
Onfido Report
”). Below, we have provided a graphical representation of an Onfido Report:
Each Onfido Report contains an overall result of ‘Clear’ or ‘Consider’:
If we’re able to verify the identity of a user, and the requested checks do not show signs of fraud or other anomalies, we notify the client that the checks are Clear.
If we’re unable to verify the identity of a user, or the user isn’t able to pass all requested checks or the checks show signs of fraud or other anomalies, we return a Consider result.
If we return a Consider result, we will also provide a detailed breakdown of the reasons why. (The reasons are generated from the different machine learning models and/or human powered processes that are used to verify an identity or perform a check.)
Onfido Reports contain recommendations only and the reasons behind them. It is then for the client to decide how to proceed with a user - based on the content of the Onfido Report, but also on the basis of other information available to them (including additional information they may have or decide to request from their users).
By providing our clients with these detailed Onfido Reports, our aim is to empower our clients to make informed decisions about their users and to provide help to users that are having difficulty in passing an Onfido check.
3. Using Information As Controller
As explained above, when we use personal information to provide Identity Services to our clients, we are acting on their behalf as their service provider and processor. However, we also process the personal information of users, and others, on our own behalf (as a “controller”) for the purposes described in this section. If you are in the EEA or UK, we will only use your personal information for a particular purpose where we have a “legal basis” for this. We have set out below the legal bases we rely upon for each purpose.
To develop and improve our Identity Services (including machine learning technologies)
At Onfido, our vision is to simplify digital identity. To do this, provided we have the permission of our clients and it is not prohibited by applicable law, we use the personal information we collect about our clients’ users (as described above) to improve and develop our Identity Services. For the same purpose, we may also use personal information that has been made publicly available or that we have obtained from a third party provided this is not prohibited by applicable law.
Developing and improving our Identity Services includes building and improving our technology (such as our machine learning technologies and algorithms) and developing and testing new checks, products and services to better verify a user’s identity and/or detect fraud. For example, we may need to train our models to recognise a novel fraud attack, a new version of an ID document or to minimize bias and improve performance. As part of this work, we train our technology to recognize specific patterns in information and make predictions about new sets of information based on those patterns. This is known as machine learning. We also train our human analysts to perform those tasks so they can assist when our machine learning models aren’t best suited for the task or are still learning. Sometimes, we’ll also re-run and re-submit checks to ensure our Identity Services are working properly, particularly when testing a new feature or service for quality checks. Together, these developments help make Onfido’s Identity Services stronger and safer for all clients and users.
We process personal information for these purposes on the basis that it is necessary for the legitimate interest of our clients and Onfido. Financial crime, fraud, and corruption are serious issues that affect not only the law enforcement community but financial institutions, the private sector, and other major corporations – as well as individuals themselves. As such, Onfido considers there is a clear legitimate interest in improving and developing our Identity Services for the purpose of continuing to effectively tackle and reduce fraud.
Where we use sensitive personal information for these purposes (for example, information which could potentially reveal information about someone’s racial or ethnic origin), we primarily process this information on the basis that it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest. Such public interests include ensuring equality of treatment across all types of users by measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias with a view to providing fair and inclusive Identity Services, which effectively detect fraud, and are balanced against the rights and freedoms of users. When developing our services, Onfido implements specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of those individuals whose data is used for this purpose, including pseudonymisation (where possible), impact assessments and strict security controls to safeguard their fundamental rights and their interests.
To compile statistics, benchmarking and analytics
We use personal information (such as check results, identity document type, and device metadata) to create statistics regarding the use and performance of our Identity Services. We provide these statistics to our clients so that they and we may use them to, for example, conduct benchmarking and analytics (for example, to compare a client’s missed fraud rates to the general missed fraud rate for an industry, or to analyze fraud trends). We also use these statistics to gain market insights (for example, to enhance understanding of missed fraud trends and identify fraud patterns) and to inform our decision making on product improvements. An individual cannot be identified from these statistics and where possible, we pseudonymise, aggregate and/or de-identify (and where feasible anonymise) personal information which is used for these purposes.
We process personal information for these purposes on the basis that it is necessary for Onfido’s and our clients’ legitimate interests in understanding (at the aggregate level) how people are using our Identity Services.
For compliance with applicable law/regulation, to exercise, establish or defend legal rights or claims, or to protect someone’s vital interests
Onfido may process the personal information we collect about our clients’ users (as described above) where this is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, to exercise, establish or defend legal rights or claims, or to protect someone’s vital interests. For example, we may be required by law to:
disclose information in response to a request from a government or law enforcement body as described in the section below headed “
Government and Law Enforcement Requests
”;
collect a user’s broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location), either directly from them or the client or by approximating this based on the user’s device’s IP address, to enable Onfido and our clients to comply with global sanctions requirements and the increasing number of biometric and privacy laws that apply to our Identity Services. We use this broad geographic location to determine a user’s location to display the relevant consent screen and collect any necessary biometric consents or identify if a user is located in a sanctioned country where we are prohibited by law from providing services.
In connection with a business transaction or to obtain professional advice
Onfido may need to process your personal information in connection with an actual or proposed divestiture, merger, acquisition, joint venture, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or any other similar transaction or proceeding, or to obtain professional advice. We process personal information for these purposes on the basis that it is necessary for Onfido’s legitimate interest in running its business in a commercial and compliant manner.
4. Data Sharing
In addition to sharing personal information with clients and Data Providers (as described above), Onfido also shares personal information:
With third parties who help us provide our Identity Services and perform tasks on our behalf. This includes: information technology and related infrastructure providers (who provide us with a place to store your personal information); data analytics providers (who help us to analyze trends and provide market insights); and our business process outsourcing partners (whose staff perform human review and quality checks);
With other companies in the Onfido group of companies who help us to provide our services (for example, by providing ancillary engineering, technical or customer support);
With an actual or potential buyer, investor or partner (and its agents and advisers) in relation to a business transaction;
With parties that provide Onfido with professional (e.g. advisory and auditing) advice and services;
With a competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, or court;
With any other person where instructed to do so by a client. For example, if a client has configured the Identity Services to check whether an identity document has been previously identified as lost, stolen, fraudulent, or otherwise compromised by a government or other external party, Onfido may share that compromised identity document on behalf of that client, and the government or other external party may retain a copy to the extent they consider it necessary, proportionate, and lawful. Under the instruction of clients and as permitted by applicable law, Onfido currently shares identity documents with the
UK Metropolitan Police
as part of their
Amberhill Database
for such purposes; and
To any other person where we have a legitimate legal reason for doing so.
Whenever legally possible, we seek to protect the personal information we share by imposing contractual privacy and security safeguards on the recipient of that information. In some cases, however, it’s not possible for us to do so — for example, when we have a legal obligation to disclose information to a government authority and that government authority is not willing to enter into such contractual safeguards.
If the sharing of personal information involves cross border international transfers of data, we make such transfers in accordance with relevant privacy law requirements. For example, if personal information that is processed subject to the GDPR is transferred outside of the EEA/UK to a country that the
European Commission does not consider provides an adequate level of protection for your personal information
, we will require the receiving party to enter into the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses (and/or their UK and Switzerland equivalents). You can request a copy of these clauses by contacting us using the details in the section below headed “
Contact Onfido or our Data Protection Officer
.”
5. Information Security
Where possible, we pseudonymize, de-identify and/or aggregate personal information to protect privacy and minimize security risks. Pseudonymized data is where we replace, transform or remove information so that it no longer identifies an individual without additional information. Onfido also takes appropriate administrative, physical, technical and organizational measures designed to help protect the information it holds from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. For more information about information security at Onfido, please visit the
Guide to Security at Onfido
.
If you think you have identified a security vulnerability or bug in our Identity Services, please report it to the Onfido security team at
security@onfido.com
and as described in the
Onfido Responsible Security Bug Disclosure Policy
.
6. Data Storage
We provide our Identity Services on behalf of our clients for a variety of different reasons. Those reasons are identified by our clients, and we rely on them to tell us when they no longer need us to store the personal information we’ve collected on their behalf, subject to maximum retention periods imposed by applicable laws or defined by Data Providers or by Onfido.
Where we use personal information that has been made publicly available or that we have obtained from a third party to develop and improve our Identity Services (including machine learning technologies), we retain the information for as long as is necessary to complete the purpose for which the information was collected, subject to applicable laws and any retention periods.
Where we have a legitimate legal reason, we may store personal information for longer than described above – for example, where we are under a binding legal order not to destroy information.
7. Your Rights
Depending on where you live and subject to applicable privacy law, you may have the following rights in respect of the personal information we process about you as described in this Privacy Policy:
the right to request access to and disclosure of information that we hold.
the right to change and/or correct inaccurate information.
the right to block or suppress our processing of your information. This enables you to request that Onfido suspends the processing of your information in certain circumstances.
the right to object to our processing of your information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and you feel such processing impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
the right to request that we delete your information, subject to certain exceptions.
the right to request portability of your information. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, with your information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
the right to withdraw your consent, if applicable. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or regulator.
If you wish to exercise your rights in relation to how we use your personal information as described under the section headed "The Information We Collect and How We Use It On Behalf Of Our Clients”, please contact the client so they may respond to your request directly. (If you contact us instead of our client, we will notify the relevant client so they may fulfill your request.)
If you wish to exercise your rights in relation to how we use your personal information as described under the section headed “Using Information As Controller”, please contact us at
privacyrequests@onfido.com
or at the postal address below. If you exercise any of your data protection rights detailed in this section, we will not discriminate against you.
8. Government and Law Enforcement Requests
If you are a government or law enforcement body that wishes to request personal or confidential information related to a check that we may have conducted on a particular user, please contact the client on whose behalf the check was carried out. Since we provide our Identity Services on behalf of our clients, we are not able to disclose any information related to a specific check unless the relevant client directs us to do so, or we are subject to a legal requirement (such as a court order or statutory power mandating disclosure) to do so. If you wish to request the disclosure of information in respect of which there is such a legal requirement, please contact us at
privacyrequests@onfido.com
providing clear details of the legal requirement in your message.

Subject to applicable law, we may update this Global Privacy Statement from time to time by publishing a new version on this website. Socure also maintains a
DocV Privacy Notice
that applies specifically to Socure’s predictive document verification product (“DocV”). If our business customers use DocV and our other products and services, both policies apply. (If you’re not sure which products our customers use, ask them!)
How Socure Works
Socure is a platform that provides digital identity verification and fraud prevention products and services to business customers, who provide us with your personal information so we can verify your identity and prevent fraud. Socure uses predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to assess the information we receive from you, our customers, and our our data sources to answer a number of questions relating to identity verification and fraud prevention, such as:
Does this identity actually exist?
Have we seen this identity before?
Does the identity belong to the person who provided it?
What fraud risks are associated with the identity?
Because Socure does not provide any goods or services directly to consumers, you may not interact directly with Socure (outside of DocV, described above). This means that Socure processes your personal information at the request our business customers who might need to assess risks associated with an online transaction, like opening a bank account, wiring money, placing a bet on a sporting event, or updating the contact information in your account.
Only the Socure business customer decides:  (a) whether and for what reason(s) your information is provided to Socure; (b) which elements of personal information we collect and analyze on their behalf; (c) which alternative verification methods are available; and (d) whether and under what circumstances to accept, review, or reject a particular transaction.
Personal Information We Collect (and the Sources)
Socure may collect personal information about you from our business customers or prospects, from your device, from you, from data vendors, and/or from our third-party service providers. The categories of personal information we collect in connection with the products and services we provide our business customers are outlined below, together with information about the sources.
Chart A summarizes the categories of personal information Socure collects about individuals whose identities we verify on behalf of our business customers. Chart B summarizes the personal information Socure collects about individuals who work for our business customers and prospects.

Where We Store and Transfer Your Personal Information
Socure stores your personal information in the United States. If you are not already located in the United States, your personal information is transferred to the United States. Where Socure uses third-party service providers, the exact locations where they process data may sometimes be beyond our control.
How We Use Your Personal Information

perform identity verification and fraud prevention services on behalf of our business customers;
help ensure the security and integrity of the Services;

How We Protect Your Information
Socure uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, in accordance with applicable law, and we require our customers and third-party service providers to do the same. Biometric information receives the same rigorous privacy and security protections as other sensitive personal information. This includes encryption in transit and at rest, strict access controls, data minimization, and data governance procedures. Socure’s data protection practices are audited on a recurring basis, and we maintain ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 certifications. That said, there is simply no way to guarantee that any safeguards or security measures will be sufficient to prevent a security incident.
