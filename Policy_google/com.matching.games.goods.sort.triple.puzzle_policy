                                                from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification, damage, or
                                                loss.
4.2 Access Control: We
                                                strictly control and monitor access to personal information, allowing
                                                only employees with a need to know and requiring them to fulfill
                                                confidentiality obligations.

                                                services. After this period, we will delete or anonymize your
                                                information unless otherwise required by law.
Despite our efforts, we
                                                cannot guarantee 100% security due to technological limitations and
                                                potential malicious actions. In the event of an information security
                                                incident, we will promptly inform you of the incident's nature, impact,
                                                measures taken, and suggestions to mitigate risks.

If you use the Service
                                                or provide us with your information, it may be transferred, processed,
                                                and stored on servers or databases located outside your country or
                                                jurisdiction. These locations may have less protective laws than your
                                                own. If you do not want your information to be transferred or processed

                                                without parental or legal guardian permission. If a parent or guardian
                                                discovers that their child has provided us with information without
                                                consent, they should contact us immediately. We will take reasonable
                                                steps to delete such information from our records.

Pangle End User Data Privacy Policy
The Pangle End User Data Privacy Policy applies to personal data that we process through Pangle (as defined below), where you interact with Pangle through mobile applications and/or websites that have integrated with Pangle s advertising platform either directly or via an advertising exchange, each a “Partner”. The Pangle End User Data Privacy Policy will apply to the processing of your personal data in your capacity as an end user.
Last updated: 8 March 2023
I. Who we are and who this applies to
I.1 We are Bytedance Pte. Ltd., a company incorporated in Singapore whose registered office is at 1 Raffles Quay, #26-10 ,Singapore 048583 (" we", "our" or " us"). This Pangle End User Data Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains who we are, how we collect, process, store, use, transfer, share, and disclose ("process") personal data about you, and how you can exercise your data privacy rights.
I.2 It is the Partner’s responsibility to inform you of Pangle’s use of your data (i.e. by directing you to this policy) and to acquire all consent necessary for Pangle’s use of your data. We will process your personal data on the basis that your personal data is required for us to provide our services to the Partner under the relevant contract between us and the Partner.
I.3 If you have any questions or concerns about our processing of your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
II. What is Pangle?
II.1 Pangle is a mobile advertising platform, including support systems and services operated by Bytedance and accessible via www.pangleglobal.com ("Pangle"). Pangle enables advertisers to serve advertisements on third party mobile applications and/or websites owned or operated by a Partner or to which a Partner has the right to serve advertising (each a“Partner Site”). We do this by processing certain information collected from those Partner Sites, as described in this Privacy Policy.
III. What personal data we process
III.1 The types of personal data that we process depend on the circumstances of collection and on the nature of the services requested or transaction undertaken for our Partners.
III.2 When you interact with a Partner Site, we process certain information about you and your device. This information may be collected automatically from your device using our software code (referred to as a "software development kit", or "SDK"), or shared with us by other advertising exchanges (e.g. Google DoubleClick). We also use cookies (text files inserted in your browser when you visit our partners or customers' mobile applications and websites) and other tracking technologies available on your device.
III.3 The information that we process about you may include some or all of the following categories:
a. Information obtained automatically from your device
i. Identifiers: We may process device-specific identifiers such as your IP address, mobile advertising identifier (such as the "Google Advertising ID" on Android phones or the "ID for Advertisers" on iOS devices), or a Pangle-specific identifier which our SDK has assigned to your device. A mobile advertising identifier is an identifier that is provided by your device operating system and allows companies, like Pangle, to recognize your device across apps for advertising purposes. In addition to the mobile advertising identifier, and other similar technologies, Pangle may also obtain your device's model, operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), your device's language settings, general geographic region, time zone, network type (such as 5G or WiFi), your ROM version, screen resolution (to know which ads which will appear best on your device), mobile country code and mobile network code, and the time your device was last updated and started.
ii. Geolocation data: We may infer your approximate geo-location from your device s IP address. We may also process your precise latitude and longitude using your phone s GPS data, where we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to do so in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
iii. Internet activity: We may process information about your app and website usage, including the name and version of the app or website that has integrated Pangle. We may also process information about your interactions with any advertisements we deliver (e.g. information about the advertisements served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where and when the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser s website or downloaded the advertiser s app, as well as any preferences you may have expressed in respect of that advertisement).
b. Information obtained from other sources
i. From time to time, we may receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive information about you from third parties, such as advertising exchanges that share data with us for the purposes of serving advertising, if third parties are legally permitted to disclose this information to us.
ii. The information we receive from these sources may include identifiers (such as your IP address or mobile advertising identifier), information about your Internet activity (such as information about your interaction with third party websites, applications and advertisements) and inferences relating to your preferences and characteristics (e.g. your approximate age and gender).
IV.How we use personal data
IV.1 We use personal data to serve you with personalised advertisements and understand the audiences who see the advertisements we serve. Specifically, we process personal data for the following purposes:
a. To serve you advertisements: To enable third party advertisers to bid on and fill advertising space on Partner Apps with their advertising. We use your mobile advertising identifier, together with the other device identifiers described above, to serve you with personalised advertising and for related purposes such as frequency capping (limiting the number of times you see the same ad), attribution (making sure we get paid by advertisers for the advertisements we deliver), and fraud detection (detecting malicious software, or "bots", that generate false interactions with advertisements to drive fraudulent advertising revenues). We also use your device data to ensure we display advertisements that display properly on your device.
b. To personalise the advertisements we show you: To infer your interests from the types of apps you use and the adverts you interact with, as well as to infer certain demographic information about you (such as your age and gender) so we can show you advertisements that are more relevant to you;
c. To serve you advertisements on the basis of your location: To serve you advertisements that are relevant for your region and displayed in the relevant local language, as well as to better understand the audiences who see our advertisements, based on your current or prior location, including through location-based targeting segments created by us or by our third party advertisers.
d. For auditing and reporting: To verify accurate delivery of, and count the number of end users who see and interact with, advertisements we serve on behalf of our advertisers and what ad campaigns led to further consumer activity (such as a purchase, app install or visit) (sometimes called "attribution"). We use this information to report to our advertisers about the advertisements users have seen and interacted with, so that we and our publishers are paid appropriately for the advertisements we display.
e. To provide campaign analytics to advertisers: To provide advertisers information about how well their campaigns perform, whether relative to their prior campaigns, or bench-marked against third party campaigns or other data.
f. For cross-device targeting: To "link" or "resolve" the same user across their various devices (such as across mobile devices, browsers and tablets). For instance, we (or a third party partner we work with) may help an advertiser "find" a consumer they have engaged with previously on a mobile device when that consumer is browsing on their tablet, in order to target ads to the user across those devices.
g. To detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecute those responsible for such activities: For example, to identify invalid clicks (or advertising queries) and protect us and our advertisers from fraudulent behaviour.
h. To verify or maintain the quality of Pangle and improve, upgrade or enhance Pangle: For example, (i) for audit, research, and analysis of the information in order to maintain, improve, upgrade or enhance our advertising services, and to ensure that our technologies function properly; and (ii) other internal operations, such as debugging, support, and security.
i. For compliance with legal obligations: To comply with legal obligations that apply to us, for example to respond to law enforcement requests.
j. For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes.

On iOS devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “IDFA,” “IFA,” or an “ID for Advertising.” On Android devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “Advertising ID.” Please follow instructions from your mobile device manufacturer on how to locate your specific Advertising Identifier.  The following link may also help you
http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice
.
Step 2: Verify Your Digital Identifiers
To make sure that we are responding to the correct person, we also will need some supporting proof to demonstrate that the devices that have the digital identifiers you located in Step 1 are yours and that the information you are requesting relates to you. For digital identifiers located on a mobile device, please take a screenshot of the screen that displays the digital identifier.
We may also request that you respond to a few questions, so that we can appropriately verify your identity. Doing this helps us to validate that you have access to the device on which the digital identifiers have been placed (and that you are not an unauthorized third party attempting to “guess” digital identifiers).
Step 3: Submit to MobileFuse
Once you have located your digital identifiers and can provide us with verification (screenshots) of those digital identifiers, please contact us with details of the rights you wish to exercise. The easiest way to do so would be to submit the relevant information to our privacy email at
compliance@mobilefuse.com
. We request the following information:
Your full name.
The state and country in which you are located at the time you are making your request.
A clear statement indicating that you would like to opt out of interest-based advertising.
A full list of your digital identifiers with screenshots as set forth in Step 2 above.

Children
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16. If an individual is under the age of 16, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete that personal information.
10.
Information Retention and Security
We typically store the User Information we collect from your device, such as Unique Device ID, IP address and other information described above, in our systems for up to 90 days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports.
In some cases, we may keep some of the User Information for longer periods of time where required under certain laws or to comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests – for example, those relating to corporate governance, taxation, money laundering and financial reporting legislation.
We use industry-standard technical and organizational security measures to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems. Please note that no transmission or storage of information, however, can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure, though we take all reasonable precautions to protect against security incidents.
11.

For example, when you sign up for a LINE account, you provide us with information such as your phone number. Also, when you create your public profile, you provide us with a display name, profile picture, and other information you wish to use.
Information we collect as you use our services
We also collect information that is automatically sent by your device when you use our services.
This includes information regarding the devices—whether smartphone or PC—and operating systems you use to access our services, the language you use on your device, and information related to how often you open the LINE App.
Information we receive from group companies & business partners
LINE also works with our group companies and business partners to provide services for you.
For example, if you sign up for the LINE Pay service, which is provided by another LINE group company called LINE Pay Corporation (depending on your location), LINE may receive information based on the privacy policy of that group company.
Also, if you link another company's services to your LINE account, we may receive associated information from the company that provides the service, such as the user ID linked with the account.
Information uploaded by other users
Other users, while using LINE services, may provide us with information which includes the personal data of third parties.
For example, your friend may post a photo which includes you on their LINE VOOM.
Information collected directly from services provided by third parties
We provide functions that can be used on third-party websites and apps (plug-in functions) such as the "LINE Share" button and "Like" button. If such a plug-in function is installed on a third-party website or app, LINE may collect information directly from the website or app of that third party.
Information collected from websites and apps that have plug-in functions may include information about the websites you logged into using your LINE account and the websites you visited while logged in to your LINE account.
Information collected from public domain
LINE collects publicly available information.
The public information collected by LINE includes online news published on the Internet.
How do we use personal data?
LINE collects and uses personal data in accordance with the LINE Privacy Policy to provide and maintain services and contents. We also use that personal data to develop and improve on, strengthen security and prevent the unauthorized use of, and provide you with personalized services and content.
Provide and maintain services
We use your personal data to help provide a stable and smooth experience using LINE services.
For example, if your friends have your phone number, your friends can search for your LINE account using the phone number you provided during your LINE account registration. Your friends can then recognize that it is your LINE account via your public profile. This means that with the personal data collected we are providing a way for you to connect with your friends at any time.
Develop and improve services and content
The personal data we collect allows us to develop new services and improve on existing services to better serve you.
For example, we collect information about what LINE App features you use frequently to ensure that you can use those features conveniently.
Strengthen security and prevent unauthorized use
To provide you with a safe environment for staying in touch with your friends, family and loved ones on LINE services, we analyze information to help protect you, other users, the public and LINE.
For example, when we find users who engage in spamming activities, like sending messages indiscriminately to a lot of users—which is against the LINE Terms & Conditions of Use—we may take action against them, which may include banning their accounts.
Personalize content
We also use the personal data we collect to help you find what you like and to provide you with better search results.
For example, we may arrange the order of the stickers at the LINE Store based on your prior sticker purchasing history, so when you visit the LINE Store, it’ll be easier for you to discover new stickers that you may like.
Do we share personal data?
In certain limited circumstances, LINE shares personal data with LINE group companies and business partners to support the provision of services.
We never share your personal data unless we have obtained your consent or beyond what is permitted by laws and regulations. We work with LINE group companies and business partners to better provide you with LINE services and partnering services. For example, if you choose to sign up for a LINE Pay account, we share the information you registered with your LINE account—such as your phone number—to LINE Pay to speed up the opening of the LINE Pay account.
In addition, to facilitate the delivery of LINE services like customer support, we are assisted by certain LINE group companies and business partners, who use your personal data in accordance with our instructions.
We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
How do we secure personal data?
LINE implements strict technical and organizational security for the protection of your personal data.
Since your personal data will be held by us while your LINE account is active, we will always make our best efforts to ensure that your personal data is securely maintained.
If you want further details on how your personal data is being protected, please see the Security & Privacy page here:

Information for Washington Residents
If the processing of Personal Information about you is considered consumer health information subject to the Washington My Health My Data Act (“MHMDA”), you have certain additional rights with respect to that information. MHMDA protects consumer health data that is not protected under HIPAA. This section of the Privacy Policy applies to personal information defined as “consumer health data” subject to MHMDA.
Consumer Health Data We Collect
As described in the “Information We Collect” section of this Privacy Policy, the data we collect depends on how you interact with us, the services you use, and the choices you make. Because consumer health data is defined very broadly, many of the categories of data we collect are or could be considered consumer health data. Consumer health data can include:
information about your health-related conditions, symptoms, status, diagnoses, testing (including tests, diagnostics, or other interventions), or treatments. We may collect such information through your navigation of our website, surveys or other communication with you.
measurements of bodily functions, vital signs, or characteristics, including photographs, which may also be considered biometric information under the MHMDA.
information that could identify your attempt to seek health care services or information, including services that allow you to assess, measure, improve, or learn about your or another person’s health.
other information that may be used to infer or derive data related to the above or other health information.
Sources of Consumer Health Data
As described further in the “Information We Collect” section of this Privacy Policy, we collect Personal Information (which may include consumer health data) directly from you, from your interactions with our services, from third parties, and from publicly available sources.
Why We Collect and Use Consumer Health Data
We collect and use consumer health data for the purposes described in the “How We Use Information We Collect” section of this Privacy Policy. Primarily, we collect and use consumer health data as reasonably necessary to provide you with the products or services you have requested or authorized. This may include delivering and operating the products or services and their features, personalization of certain product features, ensuring the secure and reliable operation of the services and the systems that support them, troubleshooting and improving the services, and other essential business operations that support the provision of the products (such as analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and conducting research and development). We may use consumer health data for other purposes for which we give you choices and/or obtain your consent as required by law – for example, for advertising or marketing purposes.
Our Sharing of Consumer Health Data
We may share each of the categories of consumer health data described above for the purposes described in the “How We Share Information We Collect” section of this Privacy Policy. In particular, we may share Personal Information, including consumer health data, with your consent or as reasonably necessary to complete any transaction or provide any products or services you have requested or authorized, as described in the previous section above.
Third Parties With Which We Share Consumer Health Data
As necessary for the purposes described above, we share consumer health data with the following categories of third parties:
Service providers. Vendors or agents (“processors”) working on our behalf may access consumer health data for the purposes described above. For example, companies we’ve hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems may need access to data to provide those functions.
Parties to a corporate transaction. We may disclose consumer health data as part of a corporate transaction or proceeding such as a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or a transfer, divestiture, or sale of all or a portion of our business or assets.
Government agencies. We will disclose consumer health data to law enforcement or other government agencies when we believe doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process.
Other third parties. In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to provide data to other third parties, for example, to comply with the law or to protect our rights or those of our customers.
Other users and individuals. If you use our services to interact with other users of the service or other recipients of communications, such as a provider, we will share data, including consumer health data, as directed by you and your interactions.
How to Exercise Your Rights
MHMDA, if applicable, provides certain rights with respect to consumer health data, including rights to access, delete, or withdraw consent relating to such data, subject to certain exceptions. You can request to exercise such rights using the various tools and mechanisms described in this Privacy Policy. If your request to exercise a right under the MHMDA is denied, you may appeal that decision by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy, or you may raise a concern or lodge a complaint with the Washington Attorney General at
