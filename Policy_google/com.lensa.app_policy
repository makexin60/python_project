1. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
We may collect Personal Data from and about you:
Directly from you when you provide it to us.
Automatically when you Use Lensa. Information collected automatically may include Usage details and internet protocol (“
IP
”) addresses.
From third parties, for example, our service providers, partners and vendors.
2. PERSONAL DATA YOU PROVIDE TO US DIRECTLY
You may provide Personal Data to us directly, or to service providers that act on our behalf, when you Use Lensa. The Personal Data you provide depends on which features of Lensa you Use and how you interact with the app.
Photos and (or) videos that you upload to Lensa.
If you grant us permission to access your camera or your device’s photo library, we will process the photos and videos you select to upload to Lensa to provide features of the app that you choose to Use. For more information regarding how we process your photos and videos, please see
Section 3: How We Process, Share and Retain Your Photos, Videos and Image Data.
Information Regarding Gender.
When you Use the Magic Avatars feature of the app, we ask you to select the gender you want to be associated with the Avatar. You can select Female, Male, or Other. This information is used solely to generate the Avatars in accordance with the indicated gender: for example, if you choose to identify your gender as a female, then you will receive conventionally more feminine-like Avatars. If you do not want to select a gender, please select “Other”.
Account Information.
When you create a Lensa account, we ask you to provide your email address. If you log in with your Apple ID we will receive your Apple ID and may receive the email address associated with your Apple ID, depending on your Apple settings. If you log in via your Google Account we will receive your associated email address.
If you contact us or communicate with us, we will collect and receive
records and copies of your correspondence with us and contact details that you have provided us while making your inquiries
(such as your name, postal addresses, email addresses and phone numbers or any other identifier by which you may be contacted).
3. HOW WE PROCESS, SHARE, AND RETAIN YOUR PHOTOS, VIDEOS AND IMAGE DATA
We process your photos and videos to provide you with the features of the Lensa application that you choose to Use. In doing so, when you upload photos or videos to Lensa, we process your photos and videos using technology that identifies data that is in the photos and videos and provides us with information, such as information about your facial position, orientation and topology (“
Face Data
”), and other elements of your photo (collectively, “
Image Data
”). The following describes how we process, share, and retain your photos, videos and Image Data in connection with various features of the Lensa app.
Please note, however, that we may retain your data for longer time periods than set forth below where required to do so by law.
Photo & Video Editing (other than Art Styles).
When you upload photos and videos for editing, we will automatically apply technology that generates Image Data. This processing only occurs on your device and is not stored on our servers unless you choose to apply Art Styles to a photo.
Art Styles.
If you apply Art Styles to a photo you have uploaded to Lensa, we will automatically apply technology to generate Image Data. When applying Art Styles, your original photo and Image Data is stored on our servers, which are provided by Amazon Web Services (USA). We store the original photo to which you apply Art Styles and the resulting Image Data on our servers for no longer than 24 hours, after which time the original photo and any associated Image Data is deleted.
Magic Avatars.
To generate Magic Avatars, you must upload 10-20 photos to Lensa and select a gender to be associated with the Avatar. The photos you upload are stored on our servers, which are hosted by Amazon Web Services (USA). The Magic Avatars feature relies on the Stable Diffusion model. We create a copy of the Stable Diffusion model, which is hosted on our AWS servers, and apply technology that retrains the model using the photos you uploaded and generates Image Data to create and personalize your Avatars. Immediately after the successful generation of Avatars, your original photos, the copy of the Stable Diffusion model, as well as any associated Image Data, are deleted permanently from our AWS servers. We do not Use your Personal Data to train and/or create separate artificial intelligence/products.
Your Avatars
are stored on our servers (provided by Amazon Web Services (USA)) and are available to you within the Lensa app at any time, via any device from which you log into the Lensa application, until you decide to either (i) delete the Avatars or, (ii) delete your Lensa account. If you delete an Avatar, we will generally process the deletion within 4 hours. If you delete your Lensa account, we will generally delete your account, including the Avatars in your account, within 4 hours.
Please be aware that deleting the Lensa application from your device does not result in the deletion of your Lensa account!

1. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
We may collect Personal Data from and about you:
Directly from you when you provide it to us.
Automatically when you Use Lensa. Information collected automatically may include Usage details and internet protocol (“
IP
”) addresses.
From third parties, for example, our service providers, partners and vendors.
2. PERSONAL DATA YOU PROVIDE TO US DIRECTLY
You may provide Personal Data to us directly, or to service providers that act on our behalf, when you Use Lensa. The Personal Data you provide depends on which features of Lensa you Use and how you interact with the app.
Photos and (or) videos that you upload to Lensa.
If you grant us permission to access your camera or your device’s photo library, we will process the photos and videos you select to upload to Lensa to provide features of the app that you choose to Use. For more information regarding how we process your photos and videos, please see
Section 3: How We Process, Share and Retain Your Photos, Videos and Image Data.
Information Regarding Gender.
When you Use the Magic Avatars feature of the app, we ask you to select the gender you want to be associated with the Avatar. You can select Female, Male, or Other. This information is used solely to generate the Avatars in accordance with the indicated gender: for example, if you choose to identify your gender as a female, then you will receive conventionally more feminine-like Avatars. If you do not want to select a gender, please select “Other”.
Account Information.
When you create a Lensa account, we ask you to provide your email address. If you log in with your Apple ID we will receive your Apple ID and may receive the email address associated with your Apple ID, depending on your Apple settings. If you log in via your Google Account we will receive your associated email address.
If you contact us or communicate with us, we will collect and receive
records and copies of your correspondence with us and contact details that you have provided us while making your inquiries
(such as your name, postal addresses, email addresses and phone numbers or any other identifier by which you may be contacted).
3. HOW WE PROCESS, SHARE, AND RETAIN YOUR PHOTOS, VIDEOS AND IMAGE DATA
We process your photos and videos to provide you with the features of the Lensa application that you choose to Use. In doing so, when you upload photos or videos to Lensa, we process your photos and videos using technology that identifies data that is in the photos and videos and provides us with information, such as information about your facial position, orientation and topology (“
Face Data
”), and other elements of your photo (collectively, “
Image Data
”). The following describes how we process, share, and retain your photos, videos and Image Data in connection with various features of the Lensa app.
Please note, however, that we may retain your data for longer time periods than set forth below where required to do so by law.
Photo & Video Editing (other than Art Styles).
When you upload photos and videos for editing, we will automatically apply technology that generates Image Data. This processing only occurs on your device and is not stored on our servers unless you choose to apply Art Styles to a photo.
Art Styles.
If you apply Art Styles to a photo you have uploaded to Lensa, we will automatically apply technology to generate Image Data. When applying Art Styles, your original photo and Image Data is stored on our servers, which are provided by Amazon Web Services (USA). We store the original photo to which you apply Art Styles and the resulting Image Data on our servers for no longer than 24 hours, after which time the original photo and any associated Image Data is deleted.
Magic Avatars.
To generate Magic Avatars, you must upload 10-20 photos to Lensa and select a gender to be associated with the Avatar. The photos you upload are stored on our servers, which are hosted by Amazon Web Services (USA). The Magic Avatars feature relies on the Stable Diffusion model. We create a copy of the Stable Diffusion model, which is hosted on our AWS servers, and apply technology that retrains the model using the photos you uploaded and generates Image Data to create and personalize your Avatars. Immediately after the successful generation of Avatars, your original photos, the copy of the Stable Diffusion model, as well as any associated Image Data, are deleted permanently from our AWS servers. We do not Use your Personal Data to train and/or create separate artificial intelligence/products.
Your Avatars
are stored on our servers (provided by Amazon Web Services (USA)) and are available to you within the Lensa app at any time, via any device from which you log into the Lensa application, until you decide to either (i) delete the Avatars or, (ii) delete your Lensa account. If you delete an Avatar, we will generally process the deletion within 4 hours. If you delete your Lensa account, we will generally delete your account, including the Avatars in your account, within 4 hours.
Please be aware that deleting the Lensa application from your device does not result in the deletion of your Lensa account!
