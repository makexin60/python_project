How To Use Cookies and Related Technologies
FlowGPT utilizes local storage technologies, including cookies, pixel labels, and web beacons, to enhance its websites, online services, email communications, and advertisements. The data gathered through these mechanisms is generally categorized as non-personal information. However, should regional legislations classify IP addresses or similar identifiers as personal data, FlowGPT aligns with this perspective and treats such identifiers with the same regard. It's also important to note that we may combine this non-personal data with other personal information we possess. When such data integration occurs, for the scope of this policy, we treat the combined data as personal information, ensuring its collection, usage, and protection in line with the guidelines outlined in our privacy policy.
Cookies
Cookies are simple text files placed on your computer or mobile device by a server. The server that created the cookie is the only one that can access its content. Each cookie is tailored to your specific web browser or app, and they typically include identifiers, site names, and alphanumeric characters.
FlowGPT employs cookies to enhance your interaction experience, such as:
Essential Cookies:
These facilitate login and verification processes, allowing seamless navigation across our website without repeated logins.
They also help in remembering your preferences and settings, like language and font size, for a customized browsing experience.
Analytical Cookies: These tools enable us to understand user engagement with our site by tracking single or multiple visits, which assists in improving site functionality and user satisfaction.
Advertising Cookies: Designed to deliver targeted advertising based on your online activity, these cookies help us to present content and advertisements that are most relevant to your interests.
You have the ability to manage your cookie preferences, including deletion and blocking options, through your web browser's settings. However, please be aware that clearing cookies may necessitate reconfiguring user settings upon each visit to FlowGPT's website, and disabling cookies might impact the functionality of certain services.
Web Beacons/Pixel Labels
Beyond cookies, FlowGPT and its partners also employ web beacons and pixel labels. These are typically small electronic images embedded within our website or emails, serving to recognize when web pages or emails are viewed on your device. They also ensure that emails are delivered in a readable format and inform us if they have been opened.
These technologies aid in analyzing service usage and tailoring content and advertisements to better serve your needs. For instance, emails from FlowGPT may include clickable links that lead to specific content on our website. Tracking these interactions helps us to better understand your preferences and enhance our customer service.
Additional Local Storage Technologies
We and our third-party collaborators may also utilize other local storage solutions, such as
local shared objects (also known as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage. These technologies, while similar to cookies, may differ in the way they are used and stored on your device, and thus might not be manageable through standard browser settings.
Do Not Track
While many web browsers offer a "Do Not Track" feature that sends a request to websites, there is currently no consensus among major Internet standards organizations on how to respond to these requests.
As of now, FlowGPT does not alter its data processing practices in response to the "Do Not Track" setting or similar features.
How Do We Use Third-party SDKs
At our service, we incorporate various third-party SDKs (Software Development Kits) to enhance and optimize our offerings. Here's a breakdown of how we utilize these tools:
Firebase Push SDK
: This SDK is instrumental in delivering real-time message notifications to our users. By leveraging the capabilities of Firebase, we ensure that you receive timely and relevant updates and messages, thereby improving your engagement and experience with our services.
ClickStream Analytics SDK
: To continuously refine our product offerings and services, we employ the ClickStream event tracking SDK. This tool allows us to gather and analyze user behavior data, providing valuable insights into how our users interact with our platform. This data is crucial for identifying areas of improvement and for tailoring our services to better meet your needs.
Attribution SDK for Online Marketing
: Understanding the channels through which our users discover our services is key to effective online marketing. By using an attribution SDK, we can accurately track and analyze user acquisition across various marketing channels. This enables us to make data-driven decisions and to optimize our marketing strategies, ensuring that we reach the right audience with targeted and relevant messages.
Our use of these SDKs is in line with our commitment to providing a superior user experience while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and data security. We value your trust and ensure that any data collected through these SDKs is handled responsibly and in accordance with our privacy policy.
Business Transfers
All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.
Information Security Retention
FlowGPT.com maintains appropriate technical, administrative, and physical safeguards that are designed to prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal data we collect or store and to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons that may be involved with our processing operations. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, it is not possible to guarantee the security of personal data transmitted over the Internet. You use the website and provide us with personal data at your own discretion and risk.
We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.
We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
Personal Data of Children
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. Our Services are not directed to children under 13. Also, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under
16. Specifically, we do not collect any personal information as defined by COPPA from the FlowGPT mobile application when a user only uses such application without registering an account with the FlowGPT Services, and we do not allow users who identify themselves as under the age of 16 to register for an account with the FlowGPT Service. If you are a child under 16 years of age, please do not attempt to register for an account with the Services or otherwise send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 years of age has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at
support@flowgpt.com.

Exercising Your Rights

unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
You may submit a Valid Request at
support@flowgpt.com.
You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf.
