Mechanisms such as the application data cache are used to collect data and save it locally on the user’s device.
If the user does not register as a member on the platform provider or does not use a social media account for the service but rather uses a guest account to access the service, Neptune cannot identify the user solely through data collected while using the service and can only identify users with an account on the platform provider’s service or a social media account.
(2) Use of Information Collected
Neptune uses information provided by the platform provider or collected or recorded while using the service for the purposes of service provision, maintenance, security, updates, and development and provision of new services. Data is also used to provide more relevant customized services (including advertisements) to users.
Neptune may display on the service the user nicknames, profiles, and friend information provided by the platform provider and users may change the display of this information at any time by using the application’s feature enabling users to change the display on the platform provider and/or social media website.
If users make service-related inquiries via telephone or email, Neptune may keep records of communication with users to provide answers to those inquiries. Furthermore, Neptune may use user emails to provide users with information relevant to service usage. Moreover, Neptune may use information collected(excluding information of EEA user’s) or provided to update the service environment or quality for users, and Neptune’s automated system may analyze users’ records of service usage and/or payments to provide individual users with valuable features such as targeted advertisements.
If Neptune uses collected or provided user data for purposes other than those declared in the Privacy Policy, it will declare these purposes to users in advance and receive prior consent.
Data collected or provided by Neptune may be processed by Amazon Web Services (AWS region: Frankfurt, Germany and California, USA) with safety measures certified as appropriate in accordance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, and user data may be processed at the other AWS region(Seoul, South Korea) to provide better service or implement the service contract to users. ​
(3) Shared Information
Neptune does not share data with companies or people outside Neptune with the following exceptions. This data may be shared in the following cases.
If the user agrees.
Neptune may share data with companies or people other than Neptune with user consent. However, if such data must be shared, prior consent shall be obtained from users.
When external processing is required.
Neptune may entrust data processing to its partners or reliable companies in compliance with physical and technical frameworks that follow internal policies (self-regulatory frameworks). In such cases, Neptune bears all liability for the companies to which data processing is entrusted.
If required by law.
If Neptune deems it necessary to access, use, store, or publish information for the following purposes, Neptune will share information with external companies, organizations, or individuals.
If data is requested through legal proceedings, regulations, or relevant laws, or by an investigative or regulatory agency with legal power
If needed to detect, prevent, or resolve fraud, technical, or security problems
If needed to protect users or the public from elements threatening user or public rights, assets, or public safety
Neptune may share anonymous data or data that does not allow users to be identified with its partners. Furthermore, if Neptune is subject to acquisition, merger, or sale of assets (collectively referred to as “M&A” below), it may transfer data to the company undertaking the M&A while maintaining the confidentiality of the information, and in such cases, it will notify users before user data is transferred to the company undertaking the M&A.
(4) Information Security
Neptune’s information security management system has been certified safe and reliable by the Korean government and works to protect the data in Neptune’s possession from illegal access, modification, release, or deletion. In particular, Neptune periodically reviews the privacy lifecycle and continuously makes necessary updates by applying the latest technology to collect, store, and use personal data to ensure users can safely access the system. This includes using SSL (secure socket layer) and taking physical and technical protective measures to detect unauthorized access to the service system. Furthermore, access authority is limited to the minimum number of employees necessary according to internal policies (self-regulatory frameworks).
(5) Updating and Deleting Information
Updating information provided by the platform provider.
Users may request updates of their own data from the platform provider at any time while using the service. Users who are nationals of EU member nations may additionally request access, rectification, adaptation or alteration, transfer or movement of their data, and may restrict or oppose processing or profiling (collectively referred to as “processing”, below). Neptune has no authority to process data provided to the platform provider by the user. Therefore, if users request processing of their own data provided to Neptune by the platform provider, Neptune will inform users that it has no authority to process user data and instruct them to request data processing from the platform provider and/or social media provider
Updating information collected while using the service.
Users may request updating or processing of their own data from Neptune while using the service (restricted to nationals of EU member nations) and, unless data must be kept for reasonable business purposes or legal purposes, Neptune will attempt to fulfill this processing request without delay. Furthermore, this requested user data processing will be provided free of charge so long as it does not require excessive effort to comply, and Neptune may request verification of user identity before updating or processing the data.However, the user request may be denied if it is unreasonably repeated, if it requires excessive technical effort to comply (e.g. if a new system must be developed or existing practices must be fundamentally changed), if the request impinges upon others’ rights or freedoms, or if the request is extremely impractical. In such cases, the user may lodge an objection or file a civil complaint with the privacy protection agency in the user’s country of residence in accordance with Neptune’s CS procedure for rejection of processing.
Information Delete
: Users have the right to request the deletion of their Personal Data, subject to certain exceptions. Once We receive and confirm their request, We will delete (and direct Our Service Providers to delete) their personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. To protect user data from accidental or malicious deletion and for maintenance and management of the service, copies of user data may not be immediately deleted from service servers even after a user deletes his or her data from the service. Furthermore, data may not be deleted from backup systems for a certain period of time to comply with laws in the user’s country of residence and/or the country of Neptune’s business jurisdiction. In such cases, this data will be deleted without delay once the storage period required by relevant laws has elapsed.
(6) Privacy Policy Applicability & Changes
The Privacy Policy does not apply to other sites (including advertisements) linked to the service or sites that may be included in the service.
Furthermore, the Privacy Policy is subject to occasional change. If changes are made to the Privacy Policy, these changes will be announced to users beforehand, and if these changes are significant, they will be announced via email or push notifications etc.
