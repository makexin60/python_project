Poniżej znajdziesz konkretne przykłady danych osobowych i cele, dla których je przetwarzamy wraz z podstawami prawnymi:
Dane osobowe, które podajesz jako Użytkowniczka zarejestrowana, w tym podczas Rejestracji, jak i uzupełnienia Twojego Profilu.
Przetwarzanie Twoich wybranych danych jest niezbędne do wykonania umowy łączącej Ciebie i OvuFriend („Umowa”), do zawarcia której dochodzi w drodze akceptacji przez Ciebie Regulaminu.
Aby zarejestrować się w Aplikacji i w Portalu musisz podać dane niezbędne do utworzenia konta i obsługi Twojego Profilu (adres e-mail i hasło). Służą one wyłącznie dla zapewnienia Ci dostępu do Twojego konta w Aplikacji i w Portalu z wyłączeniem osób trzecich.
Dodatkowo, oprócz powyższych danych zapewniających Tobie dostęp do konta, w celu pełnej realizacji umowy, podczas Rejestracji poprosimy Cię o podanie danych początkowych, które ułatwią nam rozpoczęcie prowadzenia dla Ciebie kalendarza i pozwolą nam rozpocząć śledzenie Twoich cykli miesiączkowych lub przebiegu ciąży. Są to takie dane, jak na przykład: Twój wiek, liczba miesięcy starań o ciążę, data rozpoczęcia ostatniej miesiączki (etap planowania ciąży) ALBO data rozpoczęcia ciąży, wiek, waga, wzrost (etap ciąży).
Podanie przez Ciebie wyżej wymienionych danych jest zawsze dobrowolne, ale niezbędne, by zarejestrować się w Aplikacji lub w Portalu. Przetwarzanie wyżej wymienionych danych odbywa się na podstawie Twojej wyraźnej zgody, wyrażonej podczas rejestracji w Aplikacji lub w Portalu.
W celu pełnej realizacji umowy podczas korzystania z Aplikacji lub Portalu jako Użytkowniczka zalogowana możesz uzupełniać dodatkowe informacje dotyczące płodności lub ciąży.
Ważne - na żadnym etapie korzystania z Aplikacji lub Portalu nie poprosimy Cię i nie chcemy abyś wpisywała takie dane jak: Twoje nazwisko, czy Twój adres zamieszkania. Nie potrzebujemy tych informacji, aby zapewniać Tobie dostęp do naszych usług. Dodatkowo treści zamieszczane w Aplikacji lub w Portalu przez Ciebie i udostępniane innym użytkownikom, bądź publicznie (jak wykresy cyklu miesięcznego i ich opisy, wykresy ciążowe i ich opisy, wypowiedzi na forach dyskusyjnych, wpisy w pamiętnikach) nie powinny zawierać jakichkolwiek informacji o osobistym charakterze, powinny być zamieszczane anonimowo, to jest bez podawania przez Ciebie żadnych informacji, które pozwalałyby Cię zidentyfikować.
Dane, które podajesz w Aplikacji lub w Portalu jako Użytkowniczka zarejestrowana są przetwarzane:
w celu świadczenia Ci wysokiej jakości usług związanych z prowadzeniem i obsługą Kalendarza Cyklu (etap starania o ciążę) lub Kalendarza Ciąży (etap ciąży) w Aplikacji i w Portalu;
w celach analitycznych i statystycznych – chcielibyśmy, by usługi świadczone przez Aplikację i Portal były jak najbardziej dostosowane do Twoich potrzeb, dlatego analizujemy Twoją aktywność w celu wprowadzenia nowych rozwiązań, które będą odpowiadały Twoim oczekiwaniom;
w celu badań naukowych i rozwojowych - anonimowe dane zdrowotne dotyczące cyklu, płodności lub ciąży mogą być używane podczas realizacji projektów badawczo-naukowych czy współpracy OvuFriend z badaczami klinicznymi lub akademickimi. Zgodnie z wizją założycieli Aplikacji i Portalu OvuFriend wykorzystuje naukę i zaawansowaną algorytmikę, aby wspierać kobiety w poznaniu swojego ciała i w dbaniu o swoją płodność i zdrowie hormonalne. Naszym celem jest poprawa skuteczności wykrywania schorzeń zdrowia intymnego i hormonalnego, które stanowią przyczynę problemów z zajściem w ciążę. Aby ulepszać nasze rozwiązania stosowane w Aplikacji OvuFriend, potrzebujemy danych dla naszych algorytmów. Dlatego możemy przetwarzać dane dotyczące Twojego zdrowia w celu przeanalizowania czy możesz znajdować się w grupie kobiet o wysokim prawdopodobieństwie posiadania jednego z badanych w projekcie schorzeń. Jeżeli nasza analiza wskaże, że możesz znajdować się w tej grupie, wykorzystamy podane przez Ciebie w aplikacji dane, aby poprosić Cię o wypełnienie ankiety lub wykonanie darmowych badań medycznych (np. USG, badania poziomu hormonów we krwi). Więcej o bieżących i zakończonych unijnych projektach naukowo-badawczych OvuFriend, współfinansowanych przez Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju przeczytasz tutaj: https://ovufriend.pl/artykul/badania-i-rozwoj,49.html. Zanim OvuFriend wykorzysta jakiekolwiek dane do badań naukowych, następuje ich przekształcenie w dane anonimowe poprzez usunięcie wszystkich informacji, które mogłyby zostać użyte do identyfikacji określonych osób;

V. Strony trzecie przetwarzające Twoje Dane Osobowe
Nie udostępniamy ani nie będziemy udostępniać Twoich Danych Osobowych żadnym stronom trzecim, z wyjątkiem sytuacji, które opisujemy poniżej.
W niektórych sytuacjach angażujemy inne firmy do przetwarzania Twoich Danych Osobowych w naszym imieniu. Określamy je mianem „podmiotów przetwarzających dane”.
Są to firmy z którymi współpracujemy, które pomagają nam w świadczeniu najwyższej jakości Usług, w tym w szczególności podmiotom odpowiedzialnym za obsługę systemów informatycznych Aplikacji i Portalu, podmiotom świadczącym usługi marketingowe oraz przygotowującym analizy i statystyki. Jeżeli zdecydujesz się skorzystać z płatnego abonamentu, do Twoich danych ma dostęp w szczególności podmiot obsługujący płatność – Przelewy24, Stripe lub Paypal oraz inne podmioty przetwarzające na podstawie zawartych z nami umów, takie jak firmy księgowe. Firmy te mogą przetwarzać pewne Dane Osobowe, aby osiągnąć cele związane z funkcjami Aplikacji i powiązanymi aktywnościami. Jesteśmy w pełni odpowiedzialni za wszelkie działania lub pominięcia tych podmiotów przetwarzających dane i zawieramy z nimi formalne umowy dotyczące przetwarzania danych, w stopniu, w jakim wymaga tego obowiązujące prawo.
Oto lista naszych głównych podmiotów przetwarzających dane:
AWS (Amazon Web Services, Inc.) - podmiot z którym współpracujemy w obszarze infrastruktury i bezpieczeństwa. Przechowuje on wszystkie dane osobowe podczas korzystania z aplikacji. Możesz zapoznać się z Polityką Prywatności AWS pod tym linkiem

Zapewniamy, że wszystkie podmioty, którym powierzamy przetwarzanie danych osobowych stosują odpowiednie środków ochrony i bezpieczeństwa danych osobowych.
Ponieważ część rozwiązań informatycznych, z jakich korzystamy jest oferowana przez podmioty spoza Europejskiego Obszaru Gospodarczego (EOG), głównie przez firmy z USA, w określonych przypadkach przekazujemy Twoje dane osobowe poza EOG zapewniając jednak odpowiedni poziom ich ochrony, tj. standardowe klauzule umowne oraz anonimizację danych. Przestrzegamy też pewnych przepisów prawnych dotyczących przesyłania danych, w tym procedur określonych w programach EU-U.S. i Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield (Tarczy Prywatności UE-USA i Szwajcaria-USA) pomimo unieważnienia Tarczy Prywatności z dniem 16 lipca 2020.
Informacje zanonimizowane / zespolone
W niektórych sytuacjach możemy zespalać Twoje Dane Osobowe lub pozbawić je elementów pozwalających na identyfikację w taki sposób, aby uniemożliwić ich wykorzystanie w celu ustalenia Twojej tożsamości. Dane takie przestają być Danymi Osobowymi. Możemy udostępniać takie dane instytucjom badawczym, naszym partnerom lub wykorzystywać je do celów statystycznych, na przykład możemy udostępniać lub wykorzystywać ogólne informacje o wieku, informacje demograficzne i zbiorcze statystyki dotyczące określonych działań lub objawów z zebranych danych, aby pomóc w identyfikacji trendów wśród użytkowników w publikacjach naukowych, artykułach etc. Udostępnianie takich danych przyczynia się do postępu w badaniach naukowych nad zdrowiem kobiet. Naszą podstawą prawną do przetwarzania Twoich danych w tym celu jest uzasadniony interes.
Uwaga na informacje, które zamieszczasz w społeczności
W Portalu i Aplikacji znajduje się kilka obszarów społecznościowych, takich jak Forum, Wiadomości, Wykresy na Tablicy, gdzie użytkownicy mogą dzielić się informacjami i wspierać się nawzajem.
Każda informacja (w tym Dane Osobowe), udostępniona w dowolnym obszarze zarezerwowanym dla społeczności jest z zasady dostępna dla wszystkich. Zalecamy dobrze się zastanowić przed umieszczeniem Danych Osobowych na jakimkolwiek forum publicznym. To, co publikujesz, może zostać przeczytane, ujawnione lub zgromadzone przez strony trzecie i może zostać wykorzystane przez innych na sposoby, których nie możemy kontrolować ani przewidzieć, w tym, do kontaktowania się z Tobą w nielegalnych celach. Jeśli przypadkowo umieścisz Dane Osobowe w wiadomościach społecznościowych i chcesz je usunąć, wyślij nam wiadomość na adres kontakt@ovufriend.pl.
Sytuacje wyjątkowe
Możemy też zostać zobowiązani do przekazania Twoich danych właściwym organom lub osobom trzecim, jeśli ich żądanie udzielenia takich informacji będzie miało swoją podstawę prawną lub uzasadniony interes. Możemy udostępniać Twoje Dane Osobowe w następujących specjalnych okolicznościach:
w odpowiedzi na wezwanie do sądu, nakazy lub procesy sądowe, w stopniu wymaganym i ograniczonym przez prawo (w tym w sytuacji, gdy wymaga tego bezpieczeństwo narodowe lub egzekwowanie prawa);
gdy ujawnienie danych pozwala zapewnić bezpieczeństwo i integralność Usług lub umożliwia zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa użytkownikom albo innym osobom, zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem. W takich przypadkach możemy usunąć część Twoich Danych Osobowych (np. resetując hasło, aby zapobiec nieupoważnionemu dostępowi);
gdy ujawnienie danych odbywa się na żądanie lub za zgodą użytkownika, który wprowadził je w aplikacji;
podczas tranzycji biznesowych, w których dochodzi do przeniesienia danych.
VI. Jak długo przetwarzamy Twoje dane osobowe?
Twoje dane, które zostały przez Ciebie podane podczas rejestracji w Aplikacji / w Portalu lub które zostały później uzupełnione w Twoim Profilu, przetwarzane są tak długo, jak długo wiąże nas z Tobą Umowa, do zawarcia której dochodzi w drodze akceptacji przez Ciebie Regulaminu. Po rozwiązaniu umowy przechowujemy Twoje dane przez okres, w jakim Ty mogłabyś dochodzić od nas roszczeń związanych z niewykonaniem lub nienależytym wykonaniem przez nas umowy oraz przez jaki my moglibyśmy dochodzić takich roszczeń od Ciebie.
Jeżeli przetwarzamy inne Twoje dane za Twoją zgodą, Twoje dane przetwarzamy dopóki nie cofniesz udzielonej nam zgody albo nie zakażesz nam ich przetwarzania. Przy czym masz prawo cofnięcia zgody w dowolnym momencie bez wpływu na zgodność z prawem przetwarzania, którego dokonano na podstawie zgody przed jej cofnięciem.
Co do danych, które znajdują się w dokumentacji dotyczącej transakcji płatniczych przetwarzane są przez nas przez okres pięciu lat od końca roku podatkowego, którego dotyczy dany dokument.
Ograniczenia. Mimo, że anonimizujemy lub w inny sposób pozbawiamy tożsamości dane użytkownika tam, gdzie to możliwe, możemy zachować pewne Dane Osobowe i inne informacje po zamknięciu lub usunięciu konta użytkownika, jeśli jest to konieczne do przestrzegania zobowiązań prawnych, rozstrzygania sporów i egzekwowania naszych umów.
VII. Bezpieczeństwo Twoich danych osobowych, czyli jak przechowujemy Twoje dane osobowe?
Podejmujemy wszelkie adekwatne środki bezpieczeństwa (np. pseudonimizację i tokenizację wybranych kategorii Danych Osobowych), aby chronić zgromadzone dane osobowe przed utratą, kradzieżą, niewłaściwym wykorzystaniem, nieupoważnionym dostępem, ujawnieniem, zmianą i zniszczeniem, jednocześnie pamiętając o charakterze przechowywanych przez nas danych i ryzyku związanym ze specjalną kategorią danych osobowych, które gromadzimy (informacje zdrowotne).
Jeśli posiadasz konto w Aplikacji / w Portalu, dane z osobistego profilu są przechowywane oddzielnie od danych uzyskanych podczas prowadzenia Kalendarza Cyklu lub Ciąży i ustawień usługi, więc możemy zagwarantować bardzo wysoki stopień prywatności informacji o cyklach i ciąży. Hasło jest przechowywane przy użyciu szyfrowania jednokierunkowego i nie może być przez nas odczytane.
Szyfrowanie Danych Osobowych podczas ich przesyłania oraz w spoczynku - Dane są przekazywane między urządzeniem a serwerami firmy OvuFriend przy użyciu szyfrowanego protokołu HTTPS. HTTPS jest technologią używaną do tworzenia bezpiecznych połączeń dla przeglądarki sieci Web, a fakt wykorzystania go do zabezpieczenia bieżącego połączenia oznaczony jest pojawieniem się w przeglądarce ikony kłódki.
Ochronę integralności danych;
Systematyczne skanowanie i testowanie luk w zabezpieczeniach
Środki organizacyjne i prawne. Pracownicy OvuFriend mają różne poziomy dostępu do Twoich Danych Osobowych.
Pamiętaj, że Ty również masz wpływ na ochronę swoich Danych Osobowych poprzez właściwy wybór i zabezpieczenie hasła, nie udostępniając hasła innym osobom i nie pozwalając im na korzystanie z Twojego telefonu komórkowego. Pamiętaj również, że żaden system bezpieczeństwa nie jest idealny, dlatego nie jesteśmy w stanie zagwarantować absolutnej ochrony podczas korzystania z OvuFriend ani tego, że Twoje dane nie zostaną przechwycone podczas ich przesyłania.
Jeśli dowiemy się o naruszeniu bezpieczeństwa systemów OvuFriend, natychmiast opublikujemy adekwatną informację lub poinformujemy Cię o tym fakcie w wiadomości e-mail, a dodatkowo podejmiemy niezbędne środki naprawcze przewidziane w przepisach prawa i w niniejszej Polityce Prywatności. Jeśli dowiemy się o potencjalnym naruszeniu Danych Osobowych, wraz z innymi działaniami, o których mowa w Polityce Prywatności (takimi jak powiadomienie użytkownika w określonych przypadkach), podejmiemy również określone działania w celu usunięcia naruszenia, stosownie do okoliczności, co może obejmować, wylogowanie użytkownika ze wszystkich urządzeń, zresetowanie hasła (przesłanie tymczasowego hasła do zastosowania przez użytkownika) oraz podjęcie innych niezbędnych kroków.
Jeśli chcesz poinformować nas o naruszeniu bezpieczeństwa systemu OvuFriend, skontaktuj się z nami pod adresem kontakt@ovufriend.pl.

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions Involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the AWS Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.
Third-Party Service Providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training.

Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Us and Others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of AWS, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.

Cloudflare Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 28, 2024.
We have updated our July 18, 2024 Privacy Policy to update the contact email of our Data Protection Officer.
This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the personal information that Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we use that personal information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such personal information.
CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE
Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with our Customers, users, and the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.
We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell or rent your personal information. We will only share or otherwise disclose your personal information as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy, except in cases where we first provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.
1. POLICY APPLICATION
This Policy applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of the personal information of the following categories of data subjects:
Attendees
: Those who visit our offices or provide their information to Cloudflare or Cloudflare representatives when they attend or register to attend Cloudflare-sponsored events or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, as well as those who participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Website Visitors
: Those who visit our Websites, including those who may opt to provide an email address or other contact information to receive communications from Cloudflare, fill out a survey, or provide feedback. For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites” refer collectively to
www.cloudflare.com
as well as any other websites Cloudflare operates for its own behalf and that link to this Policy. For clarity, “Websites” does not include any sites owned or operated by our Customers, including where we serve as Registrar.
Customers
: Individuals or entities who enter into a subscription agreement with Cloudflare (or its authorized partner) and to whom Cloudflare provides Services pursuant to such agreement. For purposes of this Policy, “Services” shall refer to all of the cloud-based solutions offered, marketed, or sold by Cloudflare or its authorized partners that are designed to increase the performance, security, and availability of Internet properties, applications, devices, and networks, along with any software, software development kits, and application programming interfaces ("APIs") made available in connection with the foregoing.
Administrative Users
: Those with login credentials for a Cloudflare account and/or those who administer any of the Services for a Customer. In some cases, an Administrative User and Customer may be the same individual. In other cases, an Administrative User may be an agent acting on behalf of a Customer.
Public DNS Resolver Users
: Those who use Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 public recursive Domain Name System (“DNS”) resolver service, including 1.1.1.1 for Families ("1.1.1.1 resolver"). Learn more about the 1.1.1.1 resolver
here
.
End Users
: Those who (i) access or use our Customers’ domains, networks, websites, application programming interfaces, and applications, or (ii) Customers’ employees, agents, or contractors, who access or use Services, such as Cloudflare Zero Trust end users.
Registrants:
Users of Cloudflare’s domain registrar services. Cloudflare is an
ICANN
-accredited registrar and complies with the
2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement
(“RAA”).
This Policy does not apply to “Application Users”—those individuals who use Cloudflare’s consumer-facing 1.1.1.1 Application. See the
1.1.1.1 Application Privacy Policy
for more information about the data collection and use practices for Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Application and the associated 1.1.1.1 Application Services.
This Policy also does not apply to our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, and networks, which may have their own terms and privacy policies. Our Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to the collection of personal information, in connection with the use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.
Cloudflare’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen. Cloudflare does not knowingly collect or share personal information from any person under the age of eighteen. To the extent we become aware that we have the personal information of a person under the age of eighteen, we will delete that information.
When Cloudflare is a reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS records for websites using our Services. We are a conduit for information controlled by others. It is our Customers and their users who are responsible for the content transmitted across our network (e.g., images, written content, graphics, etc.).
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT (Categories of Data Subjects)
Attendees
Name, email address, and other contact information
: We may ask for and collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you visit our offices, register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, or participate in Cloudflare’s studies such as user experience research.
Image and voice
: When you participate in a Cloudflare study, we may ask for your permission to record your voice and/or image during your participation in the study.
Website Visitors
Name, email address, and other contact information
: We ask for and—at your option—collect personal information from you when you submit web forms on our Websites, including opportunities to sign up for and agree to receive email communications from us. We may ask you to submit such personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Websites, including participation in surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, or studies, requesting customer support, submitting feedback, or otherwise communicating with us. We will send such communications in accordance with applicable law.
Log files
: Just as when you visit and interact with most websites and services delivered via the Internet, when you visit our Websites, including the Cloudflare Community Forum, we gather certain information and store it in log files. This information may include but is not limited to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, system configuration information, URLs of referring pages, and locale and language preferences.
Cookies and other tracking technologies
: We may use cookies and other information-gathering technologies for a variety of purposes, such as providing us with information about how you interact with our Websites and assisting us in our marketing efforts. You may view a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link (or, in the United States, the “Your Privacy Choices” link) in the footer of the Cloudflare homepage at cloudflare.com or in the banner displayed when you visit our Websites from certain countries (such as the European Economic Area and the UK).

We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you advertising on third-party sites based upon your browsing activities and interests.

: The Websites may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums, or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”). If you choose to participate in any of these Interactive Areas, please be aware that any information that you post in an Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others who access it. If you wish to remove your personal information from any of our Interactive Areas, please see the Section 8, below.
Customers and Administrative Users
Customer Account Information
: When you register for an account, we collect contact information. Depending on subscription level, this contact information may include your Customer name, the email address(es) of your account administrator(s), telephone number, and addresses necessary to process payment and delivery of Services. In addition, when you use the Services, we collect information about how you configure your account and the Services (e.g., firewall settings for the domains you administer). We refer to all of this information collectively as “Customer Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. Customer Account Information is required to enable your access to your Cloudflare account and Services. By providing us with any personal information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal information or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us. We also maintain logs of Administrative Users’ activity (e.g., actions taken to configure settings in Customers’ account).
Payment information
: We do not require our Customers to have payment information on file with us unless they have a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide payment and billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on which payment method you choose. For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect your card information and billing address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or personal account numbers.
Crash Reports
: When our Services encounter an unexpected error, you may be asked to submit a crash report, which may contain personal information. You will have an opportunity to review the content of the report prior to submitting the report to us.
Public DNS Resolver Users
Limited DNS query data
: We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Our 1.1.1.1 resolver service does not log personal information, and the bulk of the limited non-personally identifiable query data is only stored for 25 hours. You can learn more about our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitment to privacy
here
.
Please note that our data handling practices for our 1.1.1.1 Application, which is not covered by this Policy, are somewhat different than our 1.1.1.1 resolver data handling practices and are described
here
.

This information is processed when End Users access or use our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, devices, end points, and networks that use one or more of our Services, and when End Users access or use Services, such as Cloudflare Zero Trust. The information processed may include but is not limited to IP addresses, traffic routing data, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to and from Customers’ websites, devices, applications, and/or networks.
The End User data that we make available to our Customers via the Service dashboard or other online interface are specifically defined as “Customer Logs”.
Registrants
Contact and domain information: We collect data such as domain name and status, contact information (such as name, organization, address, phone number and email address), name server, DNSSEC, and Form of Approval (i.e., full WHOIS capture at time of transfer into our system, including the IP address that initiated the transfer).
Network Data.
Cloudflare collects and stores Network Data, which are models, observations, reports, analyses, statistics, databases and other information created, compiled, analyzed, generated or derived by Cloudflare from server, network or traffic data generated by Cloudflare in the course of providing the Service, including information required to help Cloudflare identify, analyze, mitigate, prevent, and block malicious activities on Cloudflare’s network. Examples of Network Data include service uptime and service availability metrics, request volumes, error rates, cache rates, origin and nature of malware, and IP threat scores.

These companies provide services to help us deliver customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact our existing Customers and Administrators as well as sales leads, provide marketing support, and otherwise operate and improve our Services. These Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to our instructions and in compliance both with this Privacy Policy, the contracts we have in place with such Service Providers, and other applicable confidentiality, data protection, and security measures and regulations.
Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to sell any personal information we share with them or to use any personal information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to us.

To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.
Whenever a Cloudflare company transfers personal information originating from one country to another Cloudflare group company or a third party service provider or partner in a different country, we will implement appropriate safeguards, consistent with the laws of the territory from which the data is exported. We describe the safeguards we implement
here
. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK) to the United States, we rely on our certifications under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Should these certifications lapse or become otherwise invalidated, Cloudflare relies on the standard contractual clauses, including supplementary measures as necessary for transfers to the United States. We also use standard contractual clauses for other international transfers from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.
Self-certification to the Data Privacy Framework
Cloudflare complies with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Cloudflare has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Cloudflare has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF (together, the “DPFs”), Cloudflare commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPFs should first contact us by emailing sar@cloudflare.com or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.
In compliance with the DPFs, Cloudflare commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the DPFs to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of TRUSTe, LLC are provided at no cost to you. You have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other mechanisms set out in this DPF Notice or our Privacy Notice.  For more information, please see Annex 1 of the DPF Principles, available
here
.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Cloudflare’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF). We may be required to disclose personal information we receive under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Cloudflare is liable for the processing of personal information it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Cloudflare shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Cloudflare proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
8. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES
Cloudflare  recognizes individuals’ data protection rights. You have the right to access, correct, update, port, or delete your personal information, and to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information (each of these a “Rights Request”). You may email us at sar@cloudflare.com with any Rights Request, and we will respond within thirty (30) days. Customers and Administrative Users also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at Cloudflare.com.
Please note that before we can complete your Rights Request, we will need to verify that your identity matches that of the data in which you are requesting to exercise your rights. You can expect a verification email under separate cover, to the email address associated with your personal information on file. If you are making a Rights Request on behalf of another individual as an authorized agent, we require that either (a) the data subject must verify their identity and directly confirm with Cloudflare they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the Rights Request, (b) the authorized agent must be provided power of attorney by the data subject in accordance with the law of the data subject’s jurisdiction, or (c) the Rights Request must otherwise be submitted in accordance with applicable privacy law.
For any Rights Request, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist. Where a Rights Request may implicate the personal information of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply with Rights Requests to the extent required by applicable law or the Swiss-U.S. or EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. In the event that your Rights Request is denied, residents of the U.S. states Virginia and Colorado may appeal our decision by responding to the email informing them of the denial or by submitting a Rights Request to appeal to sar@cloudflare.com, and we will respond within sixty (60) days. In the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Please note that we do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that would be subject to the Rights Requests described above. In addition, Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users. Even where “Cloudflare” may be indicated as the authoritative name server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain, we have no control over a domain’s content. Accordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for Rights Requests in accordance with their obligations under applicable data protection laws. If an End User requests that we fulfill a Rights Request, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly. Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website users.
9. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES
Cloudflare will send you commercial communications based on the communication preferences in your account settings. Cloudflare also will send you service-related communications. You may manage your receipt of commercial communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of such emails, through your account settings if you have a Cloudflare account, or you may send a request to unsubscribe@cloudflare.com.
10. DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS
We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access. We have put in place appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
privacyquestions@cloudflare.com
.
11. DATA RETENTION
We store your personal information for a period of time that is consistent with the business purposes set forth in Section 3 of this policy or as long as needed to fulfill and comply with legal obligations. The criteria we used to determine how long we store your personal information will vary depending on several different factors. We typically consider the following when determining data retention:
The purpose for collecting the personal information in the first place. For example, if you have an active account with us, we need to keep your contact information during the entirety of that time in order to provide you with support or contact you regarding your account;
The volume, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information we are processing;
The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information;
Whether we can achieve the purposes for processing with less data or through other means
Legal requirements that may apply to the data, such as applicable statutes of limitation or contractual obligations.
When the data retention period expires for a given type of data, we will delete or destroy it. If, for technical reasons, we are unable to do so, we will implement appropriate security measures to prevent any further use of such data.
12. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
If we make changes to this Policy that we believe materially impact the privacy of your personal information, we will promptly provide notice of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), as well as post the updated Policy on this website noting the effective date of any changes.
13. BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS
We may assign or transfer this Policy, as well as information covered by this Policy, in the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.
14. ENGLISH LANGUAGE CONTROLS
Non-English translations of this Policy are provided for convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.
15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
If you have an unresolved privacy or data-use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
.
16. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section, “Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in the CCPA. It does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.
How We Collect, Use, and Share Your Personal Information under the CCPA
We may collect, use, and disclose for our business and commercial purposes, the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers for the categories of individuals/users defined in Section 1 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy (e.g., email address of Customers and Administrative Users, name and contact information of Attendees);
Payment and customer records information of our Customers;
Protected classification characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, race, languages spoken, or gender) to the extent these characteristics are voluntarily disclosed to us or contained in any  content transmitted across or stored on our network;
Commercial information (e.g., records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or usage histories);
Professional or employment information;
Internet or other electronic network activity information; and
Inferences (e.g., information about your interests or preferences).
The sources from which we collect information are described in Section 2 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The business and commercial purposes for which we collect and use this information are described in Section 3 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
The categories of third parties to whom we “disclose” the information for a business purpose are described in Section 5 of the Cloudflare Privacy Policy.
Your California Privacy Rights
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.
Knowledge
. You can request information about what personal information we have collected about you, including:
the categories of personal information;
the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information;
the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.
Access
. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you.
Deletion
. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.
Correction
. You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal information and, taking into account the purpose of processing the personal information, ensure it is complete;
Opt-out of sales or sharing
. You can ask that we do not “sell” or “share” your Personal Information as “sell” and “share” are explicitly defined under the CCPA. For more information, please refer to the section titled “Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information” below.
Nondiscrimination
. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you the Services; increasing the price/rate of the Services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.
In order to submit a request to exercise your right of information, access, or deletion pursuant to the CCPA, please follow the instructions for the submitting a Rights Request detailed in Section 8, above. Please note, we reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and may need to confirm your identity to process certain requests using the verification methods described in Section 8. For example, we take reasonable precautions to verify the identities of those California residents submitting requests to delete or access Personal Information.
Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Your Personal Information
Cloudflare does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use. Making Personal Information (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information under the CCPA.
You can request to opt out of such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information using the “
Your Privacy Choices”
link in the footer below
.
In addition, some internet browsers offer the option to enable opt-out signals such as Global Privacy Control that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Cloudflare responds to these signals by processing them as a request to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information as discussed above.
Please note that you will still see some advertising, regardless of your selection. We do not impose verification protocols for processing opt out requests unless we have reason to question the authenticity of a requester’s identity, in which case we may request evidence of identity and California residency.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center
.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account
. Stripe offers a service called "Link," which allows you to create an account and store information for future interactions with Stripe’s Services and Business Users. You may save a number of different kinds of Personal Data using Link. For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.
Learn More
.
You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe
. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.
Learn More
.
More
. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Users, including about your online activity and your engagement with our End User Services, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Users
Services
. We use and share your Personal Data to provide the End User Services to you, which includes support, personalization (such as language preferences and setting choices), and communication about our End User Services (such as communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, Stripe may use cookies and similar technologies or the data you provide to our Business Users (such as when you input your email address on a Business User’s website) to recognize you and help you use Link when visiting our Business User’s website. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies in Stripe’s
Cookie Policy
.
Our Business Users.
When you use Link to make payments with our Business Users, we share your Personal Data, including name, contact information, payment method details, and Transaction Data with those Business Users.
Learn More
. You can also direct Stripe to share your saved bank account information and identity documents with Business Users you do business with. Once we share your Personal Data with Business Users, we may process that Personal Data as a Data Processor for those Business Users, as detailed in Section 1.2 of this Policy.  You should consult the privacy policies of the Business Users’ you do business with for information on how they use the information shared with them.
Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention
. We use your Personal Data collected across our Services to detect fraud and prevent financial losses for you, us, and our Business Users and Financial Partners, including detecting unauthorized purchases. We may provide Business Users and Financial Partners, including those that use our fraud prevention-related Business Services (such as Stripe Radar), with Personal Data about you (including your attempted transactions) so that they can assess the fraud or loss risk associated with the transaction. Learn more about how we may use technology to assess the fraud risk associated with an attempted transaction and what information we share with Business Users and Financial Partners
here
and
here
.
Advertising
. Where permitted by applicable law, we may use your Personal Data, including Transaction Data, to assess your eligibility for, and offer you, other End User Services or promote existing End User Services, including through co-marketing with partners such as Stripe Business Users.
Learn more
. Subject to applicable law, including any consent requirements, we use and share End User Personal Data with third party partners to allow us to advertise our End User Services to you, including through interest-based advertising, and to track the efficacy of such ads. We do not transfer your Personal Data to third parties in exchange for payment, but we may provide your data to third-party partners, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our Services to you.

. For further information about ways we may use and share End Users' Personal Data, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center
, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing your Personal Data.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Customers
Transaction Data
. If you're an End Customer making payments to, receiving refunds or payments from, initiating a purchase or donation, or otherwise transacting with our Business User, whether in-person or online, we receive your Transaction Data. We may also receive your transaction history with the Business User.
Learn More
. Additionally, we may collect information entered into a checkout form even if you opt not to complete the form or transaction with the Business User.
Learn More
. A Business User who uses Stripe’s Terminal Service to provide its goods or services to End Customers may use the Terminal Service to collect End Customer Personal Data (like your name, email, phone number, address, signature, or age) in accordance with its own privacy policy.
Identity/Verification Information
. Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.
Learn More
.
More
. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Customers, including about your online activity, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers
To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them. Where allowed, we also use End Customers' Personal Data for Stripe’s own purposes such as enhancing security, improving and offering our Business Services, and preventing fraud, loss, and other damages, as described further below.
Payment processing and accounting
. We use your Transaction Data to deliver Payment-related Business Services to Business Users — including online payment transactions processing, sales tax calculation, and invoice, bill, and dispute handling — and to help them determine their revenue, settle their bills, and execute accounting tasks.
Learn More
. We may also use your Personal Data to provide and improve our Business Services.
