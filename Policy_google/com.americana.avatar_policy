    information about you from that site or platform, such as your screen name,
    profile information and friend lists, in accordance with the authorisation
    procedures determined by such third party site or platform. We may also collect
    information from app stores when you download or update one of our
    applications.

    accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as

    Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features enables the
    sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the
    settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing
    feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection
    and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the
    privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.
We may allow third parties to serve advertisements and provide analytics
    services in connection with our Services. These entities may use cookies, web
    beacons and other tracing technologies to collect information about your use of
    our Services, including your IP address, MAC address, device identifiers,
    software and hardware information, browser information, time zone and usage
    information. This information may be used by
Senyorita
and others to, among other things, analyse and track data, determine the
    popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your
    interests and better understand your activity on our Services.

    offers and other content. You have the ability to control the collection and
    use of your geo-location information at all times. We will not allow third
