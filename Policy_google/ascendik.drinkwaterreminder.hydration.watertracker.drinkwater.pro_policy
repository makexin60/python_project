First, we want to make sure you know protecting your privacy is important to us. The following statement will help you understand how our applications deal with personally identifiable information (‘PII’). You may occasionally provide to us PII via the Internet (the Google Play Platform).
Generally, we do not intend to collect any PII from you when you download our application. That means we do not require the consumers to register before downloading our application. Also, we don’t have a Server to store such PII. However, some of the third-party APIs that we use may collect some categories of your personal information, as described in the following text.
Our Free app (excluding Pro and Upgraded version) uses analytics and ads. Analytics is based on Google Firebase which collects anonymous usage statistics that we use to improve our products. Google AdMob wants to show ads relevant to you and use the device’s advertising ID to serve personalized ads based on the user’s interests. Read all about Google page to opt-out of customized advertising: https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated.
We may get access to your PII when you decide to email us your feedback or provide a bug report. The PII we may get from you in that situation is strictly limited to your name, email address, and survey response only.
Furthermore, we will use your PII for contacting you and improving our services only. We will never use such information (e.g., your name and email address) for any other purposes.
Sending us your feedback or bug report is entirely voluntary. Also, we may update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. If you have any additional questions about our privacy policy, feel free to email us at betterlifesoft@gmail.com
In the end, our Free app is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age.
