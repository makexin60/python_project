Verify your identity to assess your application to
          provide you our Services. This decision helps us
          make sure we’re lending responsibly, protecting
          you and your money from financial crime, and
          ensures our decisions are fair and consistent. It
          also helps us prevent fraud, money laundering,
          terrorism financing, and allows us to check
          against sanction lists in relevant cases.
Approve or decline orders when providing you our
          Services. Our fraud risk and money laundering

        prevention agencies for bullet points 1 and 2 above.
