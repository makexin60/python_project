Please kindly note that, if you choose to share control over your Device with an App account other than yours, the data collected from your Device during the control by another App account holder will also be recorded under the name of such App account.
Please note certain models of Ecovacs Device is equipped with a vision sensor and microphone to enable some product functions or services (please refer to the product manuals to know whether your Device has such functions, how to turn on / off such functions (if applicable)). The data we actually collect depends on the context of your interactions with Ecovacs and the choices you make (including your privacy settings), the products and functions you use, your location, and applicable laws. Function-specific sections below describe data collection practices applicable to use of those product functions or services.
(4)
Voice Interaction System (not applicable to lawn mower robot)
If your Device is equipped with a Voice Interaction Systems, you can instruct your Device by using your voice. To recognize your commands, the Device relies on microphones that are active anytime. However, the Voice Interaction System is only “listening” after it recognized that you said “Okay, Yiko” (the “
Signal Word
”) and begins to record your command. As long as you did not say the Signal Word, the Device will ignore all sounds captured by the microphone.  A flashing light and an acoustic signal indicate that the recording is in progress. The Device will not store any noise recordings without indication.
The Device is able to process certain commands locally and without a connection to the internet. In the event the Device does not understand the command, it transfers an edited version of the recording furnished with your unique Ecovacs User-ID to a cloud environment operated by us (the “
Ecovacs Cloud
”).  The Ecovacs Cloud is hosted on Servers in the United States. To process the command, we apply a speech recognition system, which automatically converts your command into written text.
We use the voice recordings to make the Device execute your commands.  In particular, we will neither make the voice recordings available to any third parties, if this is not necessary to deliver the Voice Interaction System to you nor try to determine, from whom the voice command comes from or to identify you by your voice”). The recordings are furnished with a unique ID to associate the recording with the correct user account/Device. From the Ecovacs Cloud the recordings including the identifier is further transmitted to Microsoft Azure for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) service. For some models of device, we also use Google Dialogflow for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text to Speech (TTS) services.  The speech recognition system translates the voice recording into text and transmits the transcript back to the Ecovacs Cloud. The Ecovacs Cloud translates the text into a command and sends the command to the Device. If the Device does not recognize the command, the process will start again. If the device still does not recognize the command, the Device asks the user questions to identify the user’s wishes. The transcripts of your command will be stored in the Evovacs Cloud.  Microsoft Azure is operated by Microsoft Corporation, 920 Fourth Avenue, Suite 2900, Seattle, Washington 95104, US (“
Microsoft
”). To provide the ASR services, Microsoft does not need to store your voice recordings, unless you opting in the
“
User Experience Improvement Plan for Voice Interaction System
”
and consent in using and storing your data to train the AI model. In this condition, Microsoft will be entrusted to store your data to train the AI models. Google Dialogflow is operated by Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., 70 Pasir Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City II Singapore 117371 (“
Google
”).  Google stores the recordings and your data in datacenters located in USA.
The processing described in this section is necessary to provide you with the Voice Interactions System of your Device as part of our contractual arrangements. The Voice Interaction System is turned off by default.  To use the Voice Interaction System, you are required to turn it on when you set up the device or at a later stage. You can turn off the Voice Interaction System in the Device controls. When you turned off the Voice Interactions System you may no longer be able to operate your Device with voice commands.
To improve the speech recognition, you can view the transcripts and give feedback on the accuracy of the recognition of your command. For the same purpose, if you participate in the “
User Experience Improvement Plan for Voice Interaction System
”, your transcripts and voice recordings will be transferred to China for manual review, analysis, annotation, AI model trainings, for better understanding of the Signal Word and voice commands, reduce the possibility of false activation and provide more accurate voice recognition services.  This work may be conducted by Ecovacs employees or third party service suppliers who are working on Ecovacs’ behalf. In this condition, the voice recordings will be stored in the Ecovacs local server allocated in China. To ensure that your personal information is safe, we will take necessary and reasonable data protection measures when transferring your personal data outside your jurisdiction on the premise of providing appropriate safeguards in accordance with the legal requirements in your jurisdiction. The processing described in the “
User Experience Improvement Plan for Voice Interaction System
” relies on your explicit consent. This function is turned off by default.  You can choose to opt in or opt out of this program freely by clicking the button “Settings-Privacy-Data Authorization Settings- User Experience Improvement Plan for Voice Interaction System” within the App.
(5)
Object Recognition
In case your Device is equipped with a vision sensor, it is able to recognize obstacles around and thereby decide its work route during its operation.  The vision sensor monitors the work environment of the Device and compares the obstacles it encounters against the objects in the database stored on the Device.  The Device can only distinguish between different types of objects (e.g., whether the obstacle is a chair or a table).  It does not enable the Device to tell one person from another.
Obstacle Recognition is executed locally on the Device. The footage taken by the vision sensor is in high resolution. It possibly involves the collection and processing of your personal information and might enable identification of individuals in the work environment, depending upon what is revealed in such photos/videos. To eliminate the possibility to identify a person appearing on the Device, the Device blurs the areas of the footage, where it detects the shape of a human body.
This information is necessary to provide you with the functionalities of the improved obstacle recognition to enable the Device to find the most efficient work route and to determine the areas already worked, insofar as the footage shows you as the user of the App.  If the footage shows other persons (e.g., your family members or guests), it is necessary to pursue your legitimate interests to enjoy the best work results of your Device.
When you setup your Device, object recognition is turned off by default and your App will ask you, whether you want to use this functionality. You can change your settings and turn the object recognition on or off at your discretion by referring to Device Controls.  Turning off the object recognition may impair the results and efficiency of the work routines of the Device.
The data is stored on the device side only. Only if the user turns on the “User Experiences Improvement Plan” and the data transmitted to the cloud. However, the personal information (human shape/face) contained in the pictures has been blurred out beforehand. This ensures that it is not possible to identify an individual.
The data is stored on the device side only. Only if the user turns on the “
User Experiences Improvement Plan
” and the data transmitted to the cloud. However, the personal information (human shape/face) contained in the pictures has been blurred out beforehand. This ensures that it is not possible to identify an individual
If object recognition is turned on and the Device is unable to recognize an object, the Device will take a picture of the object, send it to your App and ask for your consent that the image will be sent to us in the People’s Republic of China for further processing. The transmission of the image to your App takes place via WiFi. If the Device recognized that the image shows a person, the Device automatically blurs the area showing the person. If you consented to sending the picture to us, we will try to identify the object by applying artificial intelligence technologies.  Before the image is transmitted to us, you may also add remarks to it to help us identifying the object. Only if the artificial intelligence is also unable to identify the object, the image may be manually reviewed by employees from one of our affiliates located in the People’s Republic of China. We will then store the image in our database to train the artificial intelligence and further improve obstacle recognition. Information captured for obstacle recognition is only transferred to us in the aforementioned cases and after your consent.  The processing of the images relies on your consent. In all other cases, the information captured by the vision sensor for obstacle recognition will neither be stored on the Device nor transmitted to us and/or your App.
(6)
Real-Time Video Calls
For some models of the Device, you may be able to view through the App videos and sounds taken in a real-time manner and/or their records, in this case, your Device can act as a visual monitor. To make the footage available to you, regardless whether you are at home or not, the Device streams the footage to your App via the internet.
To make persons in the surrounding aware that this function is active, a signal light mounted on the Device starts blinking and an acoustic signal sounds regularly. If you are near the Device and you do not want to be monitored by the Device, you can abort the transmission by pressing a button on the Device. In some local areas, recording third persons’ voice or making videos of them could violate the law. Before you use this function, please make yourself aware that you use the Device in accordance with the local laws applicable in your area. Please familiarize any third parties who might appear on the footage (e.g., your family members or guests) that they may be recorded by the Device and how they can abort the transmission.
The transmissions of the voice recordings and/or the images is necessary to provide you with this functionality upon your request.  If the images and/or the recordings are taken from you, processing this information is necessary for the fulfillment of the contractual relationship with you and if they are taken from somebody else, it relies on pursuing your legitimate interest to monitor your home. Please note that monitoring public areas may violate local laws applicable in your country and ensure that you use the function in line with your local requirements.
The voice function described in this article (6) is not applicable to lawn mower robot.
(7)
Remote Camera
When your Device is equipped with a camera sensor, you may also instruct the Device to save the images captured by the camera sensor. This function only allows you to save footage presented to you when you use the Real Time Video Call function (Regarding lawn mower robot, this function only allows you to save images when using the video module to view the surroundings of the lawn mower robot, and to save images during Multi-Spot guarding). To make the pictures accessible to you via the App, they are stored in the Ecovacs Cloud. You may also download the pictures to the smartphone on which you installed the App for your further use. The pictures stored by the remote camera function will be saved until you request us to delete them, when your storage is full or when you cancel your App account.
Storing the images is necessary to deliver the remote camera function to you.  If the images and/or the recordings are taken from you, processing this information is necessary for the fulfillment of the contractual relationship with you and if they are taken from somebody else relies on pursuing your legitimate interest to monitor your home.
(8)
Security Alert and Spot Guarding (applies only to lawn mower)
Depending on your model, lawn-mowing robots may notify you when somebody enters the area of operation of the Device (“Security Alert”) or a specific area designated by you (“Spot Guarding Function”).  If those functions are active, the Device constantly monitors the respective area.  In case the Device detects an object, it analyses, whether the object is a human being.  If the Device detects, the Device will take a picture of the person and send it with a push notification to your phone via the App.  The Device is not able to recognize a specific person.  It is technically it is possible that the monitored area exceeds the area of operation and/or your property.  According to some local laws it could be prohibited to monitor public areas.  Please make sure that you use the Device in line with local requirements applicable in your area.  We will not use the information obtained for any other purposes than supplying the function to you and to pursue your legitimate interests to protect your property from trespassing.
(9)
3D Maps (not applicable to lawn mower)
Some Devices use laser technology to measure your home and compile 3D Models of your home and your furniture.  From the 3D Models, the Device creates 3D Maps, including the layout of your home and the size and position of your furniture.  The 3D Models will not be combined with images taken by the camera sensor and does not allow us to identify persons in the surrounding of the Device.  You can view the 3D Maps in your App and correct errors in the 3D Maps or determine areas, where the Device should or should not clean.  We only use the 3D Maps to make the cleaning routines of the Device more efficient and to make the areas that have already been cleaned apparent to you via the App.  We retain the 3D Maps until they are overwritten by a newer version, the Device recognizes that it is used in a new home or you cancel your App account.  3D Maps is active by default and is necessary to operate the Device in your home.  Without 3D Maps the Device would not be able to determine, which areas already have been cleaned or still need to be cleaned.
You may also add details of your furniture. Adding furniture details is voluntarily.  Not adding furniture details does not influence the performance of the Device.  We use the furniture details only, to pursue our legitimate interests to make your user experience of the App more comfortable and personal.
(10)
Device Sharing.
The Device allows to be used and controlled over the App by more than one user, if this is enabled by the user who paired the App with the Device for the first time (the “
Main Account Holder
”), activated this functionality and invites further users to control the Device through their App (the “
Sub Account Holders
”).  Both, the Main Account Holder and the Sub Account Holder are required to hold an App Account. If Device Sharing is activated and several users share the control over the Device, the Main Account Holder and the Sub Account Holder will be presented the email addresses of each other.  This processing is necessary to offer you the Device Sharing functionality and to perform an existing agreement with you. If you are the Main Account Holder, please make sure that the Sub Account Holder agrees with receiving your invitation.  The invitation for Device Sharing expires one week after the receipt.  If you do not accept the invitation, the information about the invitation will be deleted after the expiry of the invitation period.  The Main Account Holder will be provided with a list of the Sub Account Holders, who accepted the invitation including the date of Acceptance and the Sub Account Holder’s user name.  Besides that, neither the Main Account Holder may access further information from the Sub Account Holders nor may the Sub Account Holders access information from the Main Account Holder or other Sub Account Holders.  If you are the Sub Account Holder, please note that the Main Account Holder can withdraw your opportunity of Device Sharing anytime.  In this case, you will no longer be able to control the relevant Device anymore or access the information stored therein.  To operate the Device Sharing option, we use your email address, your App Account details and an identifier that connects your App with the Device.  Using this information is necessary to deliver the Device Sharing function to you upon your request.
Please kindly note that, if you choose to share control over your Device with an App account other than yours, the data collected from your Device during the control by another App account holder will also be recorded under the name of such App account.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories

Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
