Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies; Advertising
We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s) and to collect information about your activity on our platform. We may use them for purposes of authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and allowing you to use features.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Matchmaking Saints, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
We may use information to select and show personalized ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you. If you would prefer not to participate in the services offered through these solutions, you can opt-out of this activity by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website by clicking
