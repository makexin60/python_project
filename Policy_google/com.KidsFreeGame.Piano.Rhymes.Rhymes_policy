Compliance with COPPA & GDPR
We follow the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
in the U.S., which requires us to inform parents or legal guardians about how we collect, use, and share personal data from children under
13 years old
. Before allowing children under 13 to access certain features, we obtain parental consent.
Similarly, the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
in some European Union countries requires us to inform parents about data collection for children under
16 years old
and obtain their consent before granting access to certain features.
Parental Consent
If we need to collect personal data from a child under 13 (U.S.) or under 16 (EU), we will first seek
verifiable parental consent
. Parents can read what data is collected from our "Personal Data Collected through our apps section" along with how the data will be used and how to withdraw consent.
Stopping the Collection or Use of a Child’s Personal Information:
Parents can withdraw their consent at any time to stop the collection or processing of their child’s data. To do so, email support@gunjanappstudios.com with your request. Upon receiving a valid request, we will disable data collection for the child and delete existing data where applicable.

COPPA allows teachers/caregivers and school administrators to give consent on behalf of parents
when collecting personal information from children. However, schools should always inform parents when doing so.
Sharing Information
We will not share a child’s personal information with other individuals or companies except in limited situations.
When other companies perform services for us, like customer support, email services, delivery services, call centers, data management services, help desk providers, law firms, payment processors, accountants and shopping cart providers; however, these companies are prohibited from using a child’s personal information for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law
