Fool's Dog Privacy Policy
The Fool’s Dog is committed to protecting the privacy of our users.
Towards that end, the only personal information we collect from our users is feedback on the app that users send us deliberately through our feedback form, or request help via tech support.
The Fool’s Dog never sells the names or any other information about our users to any third party for any purpose.  Your communications with our company, and your readings with our apps, are entirely private unless you deliberately share them.
Readings and journal entries are stored on your personal device.  Our company has no access to your readings, nor to your journals.  You can deliberately share your readings and journal entries with your friends using the share function.  Otherwise, the only people who can read your journal entries or see your readings are those who have physical access to your phone or tablet, and know your device password.
