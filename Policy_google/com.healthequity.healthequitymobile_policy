You can view the privacy practices applicable to specific types of information and to our different Services, and how we use personal information to conduct our business.
When we are administering a health benefit plan provided by your employer, the information we collect about you is subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). In circumstances where HIPAA applies, your plan’s HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices and not this General Privacy Notice will apply. If you have questions about which policy applies in a certain situation, please contact us using the Contact Information provided in this General Privacy Notice.

Your submission of personal information for job opportunities, or use of the HealthEquity website and/or our Services constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to this Notice. If you do not agree to this Notice, do not use the website, Services, or otherwise provide your personal information.

If you apply for a job opportunity, we collect personal information from you in connection with your resume
          and the application you submit to us. We use your information to evaluate your skills and abilities for job
          opportunities, verify your information, carry out reference checks and/or background checks (where
          applicable), communicate with you about the recruitment process, recommend potential career opportunities,
          create and/or submit reports as required under applicable laws/regulations, and make improvements to our
          application or recruitment process.

Other Data – we may also collect personal information about you from third parties or public sources as
            needed to support the employment relationship or to engage with you concerning job opportunities at our
            company. For example, before and during your employment or assignment we may collect information from public
            professional sources, such as your LinkedIn profile for recruitment purposes. We also may conduct lawful
            background screenings to the extent permitted by law, through a third-party vendor for information about
            your past education, employment, credit and/or criminal history.
If you are offered and accept employment with us, the personal information collected during the job
          application and recruitment process may become part of your employment record.
          If you are not offered or accept employment, we will keep your CV/resume on file for future job openings. You

          to
datasubjectrequest@healthequity.com

          HealthEquity is legally obligated to keep a record of our interactions with you to comply with law. We may

          purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns.
          Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or
          vexatious, or would require disproportionate effort.
We use e-mail to send newsletters, account notifications, marketing materials, and other communications, on a periodic basis to various individuals and organizations.

For California residents, our information sharing practices are in accordance with federal law. California
          law places additional restrictions on sharing information about their residents, and our policies comply with
          such restrictions.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you, if you are a California resident, to request certain
          information regarding disclosure of Personal Information (defined below) to third parties for their direct
          marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail
          to
Privacy@healthequity.com
or write us at Privacy Officer, HealthEquity, Inc., 121 W. Senic Pointe Drive, Draper, UT 84020.
Cal. Bus. And Prof. Code Section 22575 also requires us to notify you how we deal with the “Do Not Track”
          settings in your browser. As of the effective date listed above, there is no commonly accepted response for Do
          Not Track signals initiated by browsers. Therefore, HealthEquity’s system does not respond to the Do Not Track
          settings. Do Not Track is a privacy preference you can set in your web browser to indicate that you do not
          want certain information about your web page visits tracked and collected across websites. For more details,
          including how to turn on Do Not Track, visit

This Notice applies to California residents’ Personal Information, as defined below, we collect to provide
          them with certain products and services (collectively, “Services”). The CCPA and CPRA do not apply to Personal
          Information for some of our Services that are excepted from the CCPA and CPRA, such as those subject to the
          Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) or Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLBA). The
          requirements of CCPA and CPRA further do not apply to deidentified or aggregate consumer information.
In addition, updated CCPA/CPRA requirements went into effect on January 1, 2023, for applicable Services
          related to employee and business-to-business Personal Information. As a result, this Notice also applies to
          employees, applicants for employment, and independent contractors, who are California residents.
The CCPA and CPRA define “Personal information” as information that identifies, relates to, describes,
          references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a
          consumer or household. Under the CPRA, “Personal Information” further includes “Sensitive Personal
          Information” such as social security number, driver license number, state identification card, passport
          number, financial data, genetic data, biometric data, precise geolocation, and racial and ethnic origin,
          content of consumer communications (email, mail, or text), unless the business is the intended recipient,
          genetic data, and information collected concerning a consumer’s health, sex life, or sexual orientation.

If you are a California resident, you may exercise certain privacy rights related to your Personal Information. You may exercise these rights free of charge except as otherwise permitted under applicable law. Please note, there may be situations where we cannot grant your request, for example, if you ask us to delete your Personal Information that is governed by a Federal privacy regulation that is exempted from CCPA/CPRA, or where HealthEquity is legally obligated to keep a record of our interactions with you to comply with law. We may also decline your request in order to maintain our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns.

Where the CCPA/CPRA applies to the Services we provide, you may have the right to know, access, correct, and/or delete Personal Information about you which we have collected.
The Right to Know/Access:
You have the right to know the information contained in this Notice and our General Privacy Notice, and to request access to a copy of the Personal Information that HealthEquity has collected about you directly or indirectly, including Personal Information collected by a service provider or contractor on our behalf. You may access your account through the websites and mobile app and view your Personal Information.
The Right to Correct:
You may access your account through the websites and mobile app and update your Personal Information. Users may make changes to some Personal Information through their online accounts. For Personal Information that cannot be changed via your account, you may contact us as set forth above to request the change or contact your employer if the change relates to covered Services. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your requests within the limits defined by your employer program sponsor.
The Right to Delete:
You have the right to request that HealthEquity delete your Personal Information, subject to certain limited exceptions. For example, we may retain an archived copy of your records consistent with applicable law, to continue to provide covered Services, or for other legitimate business purposes.
We do not sell your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration.
We do not sell any de-identified Personal Information. We may de-identify your Personal Information for internal use only.
We do not share your Personal Information for the purposes of “cross-context behavioral advertising.” Cross-context behavioral advertising is “the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on the consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across businesses, distinctly-branded websites, applications, or services, other than the business, distinctly-branded website, application, or service with which the consumer intentionally interacts.”
We limit our use of Sensitive Personal Information to only the purposes necessary to perform covered Services, and for certain business and commercial purposes described above.
We will not discriminate or retaliate against you for exercising your consumer rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including by (a) denying you goods or services; (b) charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; or (c) providing you a different level or quality of goods or services (or suggesting that we will do so). We may, however, charge different prices or rates, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by your Personal Information. This section currently applies to consumers. In 2023, this section may also apply to employees, applicants for employment, and independent contractors.
As required or permitted under applicable law, we may take steps to verify your request before providing Personal Information to you, deleting Personal Information, or otherwise processing your request. To verify your request, you must provide your name, employer (if any), product or service, email address, phone number, and state of residence. You may also be asked to verify your ability to control the email address or phone number you have provided to us. If we believe we need further information to verify your request as required by law, we may ask you to provide additional information to us. We will review each request carefully and respond accordingly within the timeframe established by the CCPA/CPRA.
You may designate an authorized agent to request any of the above rights on your behalf. You may make such a designation by providing the agent with written permission, signed by you, to act on your behalf. Your agent may contact us as set forth in this Notice. Even if you choose to use an agent, as permitted by law, we may require you to confirm you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf or require you to verify your own identity.

with third party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who work for us and need access to your information to do that work;
to (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) to protect the rights and property of Luum our agents, customers, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use or (iii) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of Luum, its customers, or any person;

TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Personal information we collect may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We maintain primary data centers in the United States. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Statement is processed according to the provisions of this Statement and applicable law wherever the data is located. When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, in an effort to help ensure your rights and protections.
STORAGE AND RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide services requested by you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.  Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria used to determine retention include:
How long is the personal information needed to provide applicable services?
This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of the Site, enabling system security measures, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.
Do users provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?
In such cases, we may maintain the data until actively deleted by the user.
Is the personal information of a sensitive type?
If so, a shortened retention time may be appropriate.
Are we subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data?
Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.
YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES
You may have rights such as the right to know, access, and/or delete your information. These rights may differ depending on your State of residency or the source of the information, or the type of Services or Account you have. You can submit a request regarding your personal information through our Privacy portal, located here – Data Subject Access Requests.
You may also submit your requests to datasubjectrequest@healthequity.com. Please note, there may be situations where we cannot grant your request, for example, if you ask us to delete your data that is governed by a Federal privacy regulation that is exempted from your state privacy law, or where HealthEquity is legally obligated to keep a record of our interactions with you to comply with law. We may also decline your request in order to maintain our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would require disproportionate effort.
YOUR EUROPEAN PRIVACY RIGHTS
We adhere to applicable data protection laws in the European Economic Area, which, if applicable to you, includes the following rights:
If we are processing personal information based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent at any time for future processing;
You have a right to request access to, rectification, or erasure of your personal information, or to transfer or receive a copy of your personal information in a usable format;
You have a right to object to the processing of your personal information under certain circumstances; and

Privacy Policy

For Your Protection
Further is committed to providing you with best in class products and services.  As part of obtaining our products and services, we understand that you provide Further with personal, private information and we take this responsibility seriously.

In some situations, where state laws provide greater protection for your privacy, we will follow the provisions of that state law. Further requires all of its employees, business associates, providers and vendors to adhere to federal and state privacy laws. Following are descriptions of how your protected health information is handled throughout our administration of your personal spending account.

If we do agree to a restriction, we will send you a written confirmation and will not use or disclose your protected health information in violation of that restriction. If we don’t agree, we will notify you in writing.
Your right to confidential communications
. We will make every effort to accommodate reasonable requests to communicate with you about your protected health information at an alternative location. For our records, we need your request in writing. It is important that you understand that any payment or payment information may be sent to the original address in our records.

You also have the right to request an electronic copy of protected health information that is maintained electronically.
Your right to amend your protected health information
. You have the right to ask us to amend any protected health information that is contained in a “
designated record set
.” (click the link for definition) For our records, your request for an amendment must be in writing. Further will not amend records in the following situations:

Further did not create the records that you want amended
Further has determined that the records are accurate and complete
The records have been compiled in anticipation of a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding
If you have requested an amendment under any of these situations, we will notify you in writing that we are denying your request. You have the right to file a written statement of disagreement with us, and we have the right to rebut that statement. Please note that changes of addresses are not required in writing.
Your right to information about certain disclosures
