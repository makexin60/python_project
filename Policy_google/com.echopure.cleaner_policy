In addition, we have implemented processes in place to support Users having habitual residence in EU to receive information how their Personal Data is processed and how to exercise their rights, which are as follows:
Right of access: you have the right to obtain from the Data Controller confirmation as to whether or not Personal Data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the Personal Data and the following information: (a) the purposes of the Processing; (b) the categories of Personal Data concerned; (c) the Recipients or categories of Recipient to whom the Personal Data have been or will be disclosed, in particular Recipients in third countries or international organizations; (d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the Personal Data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; (e) the existence of the right to request from the Data Controller rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of Processing of Personal Data concerning you or to object to such Processing when it is marketing purposes; (f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; (g) where the Personal Data are not collected from you, any available information as to their source; (h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling or at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such Processing for you and (i) other processing-relevant information.
Right to rectification: you shall have the right to obtain from the Data Controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate Personal Data concerning you - right to have incomplete Personal Data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
Right to erasure ("to be forgotten"): you have the right to request the Data Controller to delete without undue delay the Personal Data that concern you, when they are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected and/ or processed; when you withdraw your consent, on which their processing is based and there is no other legal basis for it; when you object to their Processing for the purposes of direct marketing and there are no legitimate grounds for processing to take precedence; when your Personal Data is processed in violation of the principles outlined above; when it must be deleted in order to comply with a legal obligation for the Data Controller or the Personal Data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services. This right shall not apply to the extent that Processing is necessary: (a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; (b) for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller; (c) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health; (d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in so far as the right is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that Processing; or (e) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Right to restriction of Processing: the Data Controller restricts the processing of Personal Data without deleting them when: (i) the accuracy of the Personal Data is disputed by you as a Data Subject and this cannot be verified, or (ii) Personal Data must be kept for evidentiary purposes.
Right to data portability: you have the right to receive the Personal Data concerning you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the Data Controller to which the Personal Data have been provided, when the Processing is based on a contractual obligation and is performed in an automated manner. This right of yours cannot adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
Right of objection: If you have consented to the Processing of your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object to this Processing at any time, including when it involves profiling. In any such case, the Processing of your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing is suspended.
In addition you have the right not to be the subject of a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal consequences for you and affects you significantly. In case you exercise this right, the Data Controller is obliged to apply appropriate measures to protect your rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, ensuring human intervention and giving you the right to express your point of view and challenge its decision.
As a Data Subject, you may exercise the rights above by submitting a written application to the Data Controller. The application can be submitted by mail (at the address of the Data Controller or by e-mail). The application must contain: (i) name, surname, habitual residence, IP address (if applicable); (ii) a description of the request; (iii) a preferred form of obtaining information in the exercise of rights; (iv) signature, date of filing of the application. When the Data Controller has reasonable concerns, it may request additional information needed to verify your identity. The Data Controller satisfies your requests completely free of charge within (1) month of receipt. The period may be extended by two (2) months when this is necessary due to the complexity or number of requests. Where requests from a Data Subject are manifestly unreasonable or excessive, in particular because of their recurrence, the Data Controller may: (i) charge a fee commensurate with the administrative costs of providing the information or correspondence, or of acting on the request, or (ii) refuse to act on the request. Each time the Data Controller refuses to accept an application submitted by you for the exercise of the rights above, you will receive a written refusal, as well as the reasons for it. In these and other cases, the Data Controller will also inform you of your right to appeal or seek a court redress.
A register that contains information on submissions, considerations, and responses to all Data Subjects` requests will be kept by the Data Controller.

In some cases the communication shall not be required, especially when: (i) we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the Personal Data affected by the Personal Data breach, such as encryption; (ii) we have taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to your rights and freedoms is no longer likely to materialize; (iii) it would involve disproportionate effort, in which case, you will be informed in an equally effective manner like via a public communication or other.
