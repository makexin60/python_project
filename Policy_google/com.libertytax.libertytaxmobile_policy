Other Information We Collect
On our Apps and Websites, we and our partners use cookies, flash
          cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. These
          technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site,
          tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic
          information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports
          based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an
          individual as well as aggregated basis.
We use cookies for online customer support, analytics service
          providers and other legal purposes. Users can control the use of
          cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you
          may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas
          of our site may be limited.

          out of or otherwise control the collection of certain information
          about your online activities.

          collected data to other information we collect about you.

          preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain
          features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web
          browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store
