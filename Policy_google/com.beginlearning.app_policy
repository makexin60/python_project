To collect the information in the “Automatically Collected Information” section above, we and our

        providers may use web server logs, cookies, tags, tracking pixels, and similar tracking technologies. We use
        these
        technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future.
A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you use the BEGiN Services, that enables
            us
            to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the BEGiN
            Services

            content
            and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with
            security
            and administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with
            Flash
            technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files.
Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique
            identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email that are designed to: (1) collect usage information
            like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates; (2) measure popularity of the BEGiN Services and
            associated advertising; and (3) access user cookies. This website uses cookies, plugins, web beacons
            and/or pixels to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart including when you have 
            abandoned your cart and this information is used to determine when to send cart reminder messages via SMS.
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.

        cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information
        (e.g.,

        including flash cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at
Adobe’s website

        available
        or function as intended.
4. ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING
We may use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) on our BEGiN Services to collect and analyze
        usage information through cookies and similar technologies; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist
        with
        fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. The information collected by these vendors will be
        disclosed
        to or collected directly by these third parties, who use the information to evaluate your use of the BEGiN
        Services.
The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access our Services by
        non-affiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are interested
        in
        more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on

5. THIRD PARTY SERVICES; LINKS TO THIRD PARTY CONTENT
We may also work with a number of companies that assist in marketing our services to you on third party websites,
        mobile apps, and online services. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons or other tracking
        technologies to
        collect information about your use of the Services and your activities across other websites and online
        services,
        which they may associate with persistent identifiers. Sometimes, these identifiers may be derived from a hashed
        or
        encrypted version of personal information such as your email address. We may use this information to measure the
        performance of our advertising as well, for instance, to evaluate which ads or content our users prefer, or
        which
        are most effective. In addition, sometimes we or an advertising partner may tailor advertising to you across
        different devices.
These companies’ activities and your choices regarding their use of your information to personalize ads to
        you
        are subject to and set out in their own policies. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy
        govern,
        the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other
        device
        by non-affiliated, third-party providers. As described below, these providers may offer you a way to opt-out of
        the
        collection of information that is used for our interest-based advertising to you. We cannot guarantee that these
        instructions will not change, or that they will continue to be available; they are controlled by each
        third-party
        service provider, not us.
If you are interested in more information about interest-based advertising and how you can generally control
        cookies
        other tracking technologies from being put on your computer to deliver such advertising, you may visit
        the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link
or
        the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA’s) Consumer Opt-Out
                link

In connection with the BEGiN Services, you also may choose to disclose personal information on social media,
        message
        boards, chat, profile pages, blogs, and other services to which you are able to post information and content.
        Please
        note that any information you post or disclose through these services will be governed by the respective
        services’ privacy policies and not by this Policy. Such information may become public and may be available
        to
        other users and the general public. We encourage you to review the applicable privacy policy and your social
        media
        account settings before you disclose any personal information to a third party.
Notice Concerning Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference
        that
        users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the
        information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out
        mechanisms listed above. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry
        regarding
        the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals. Learn more

7. RETENTION OF INFORMATION

Sale and Sharing of Personal Information
. As explained in the “How We Disclose Information
        We
        Collect” section above, we sometimes disclose information to unaffiliated third parties we collaborate
        with or
        that provide offers that we think may be of value to you. This disclosure of information may be considered a
        “sale” under the CCPA. We also provide personal information to third-party advertising providers for
        targeted advertising purposes, so that we can provide you with more relevant and tailored ads regarding our
        services, or use analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base.
        The
        disclose of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be
        considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, or, the “sharing” of your
        personal information for purposes of “cross-context behavioral advertising.”
The following chart lists the categories of personal information we have sold or shared over the last 12 months
        and
        the categories of third parties to which we have sold or shared:

        follow
        the instructions in the “Online Analytics and Advertising” section above. You must make this
        choice on each site/app on each browser/device you use to access the Services. You must also renew this choice
        if
        you clear your cookies or your browser is set to do that. You can also submit a request to opt out of the use of
        your email address and other personal information related to that email address for targeted advertising
        purposes by
support@beginlearning.com

        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit such requests on
        your behalf. Please note that we do not knowingly sell personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
Please note that if you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your
        device
        browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Your Rights & Choices
. To learn more about or to exercise your rights regarding your data,
        please see the “Your Rights and Choices” section above.
“Shine the Light” Disclosure.
The California “Shine the Light” law gives
        residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of
        personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing
        purposes.
        We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes within the
        meaning of that law.
Retention
. We retain your information only for as long as is necessary to provide the Services
        and
        to fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other necessary purposes such as complying with our legal
        obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. In determining how long to retain information, we
        consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use
        or
        disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements,
        and
        our legitimate interests. The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed
        above)
        may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information. For example, we retain your email
        address
        as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional
        period
        of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes.  If you
        opt
        out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your
        request. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request,
        subject
        to exemptions under applicable law. We may retain cached or archived copies of your information.
12. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Your personal information may be transferred to, stored in, accessed from, or processed in the United States or
        other
        jurisdictions in which we or our service providers maintain facilities. You understand that these jurisdictions
        may
        have different data protection regimes than in the country in which you are located.
Where legally required, we will use an adequate transfer method. For example, whenever we transfer your personal
        information from an entity in the EEA and UK to the United States, we may use standard contractual clauses
        approved
        by the European Commission which give personal information the same protection it has in Europe or rely on
        another
        adequate mechanism. Where applicable, you are entitled, upon request, to receive a copy of the relevant
        safeguard
        (e.g., EC standard contractual clauses) that have been taken to protect personal information during such
        transfer.
        For a copy of the relevant safeguard please contact us using the information in the Contact Information section
        below.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data
        collection and use practices, the features of the BEGiN Services, or advances in technology. When we do so, we
        will
        post the updated Policy on the BEGiN Services with a new “Last updated” date. Updates become
        effective
        immediately on the posting of the new Policy. We encourage you to check the BEGiN Services and Policy regularly.

        we make a material change to the Policy, we will provide you with notice in accordance with legal requirements.

        from

Refer others to HOMER
, we
                may collect the contact information (such as name and email address) you provide us about those
                persons.
Once you, as an adult, are onboarded and authenticated,
            your child may begin to use the Services. Adults provide HOMER with basic information about the child as
            listed
            above and allow the child to use the adult’s account on the adult’s devices. HOMER then collects
            information about the device (as identified below), the account log in information, information related to
            the
            status of the child’s completion of the activities offered
through the Services (“Child Activity
            Information”), and related automatically collected information (as described below).
Information We Collect Through Automated Means
We may automatically collect, receive, and store certain
            information in connection with the actions you take on the Services and in connection with use of the
            Services
            (“
Device and Usage Data
”). As discussed further below
            in the “Cookies & Similar
            Technologies” section, we and our service providers, may use a variety of technologies, including
            cookies,
            to assist in this information collection. For example, each time you use the Services, we may automatically
            collect the type of web browser and operating system you use, the type of device you use (including mobile
            devices), your IP address, Internet service provider, unique device identifiers, device hardware
            specifications,
            other installed software and other information in accordance with your device settings and permissions. We

            to, from, and within the Services, time spent on each page, usage preferences, and search terms.
We may also collect different types of information about your location, including
            general location information (such as your IP address and ZIP code)
and we may use that information
        to
        customize the Services with location-based information and features.

We may collect information from other sources, such as
            payment, analytics, and security service providers, survey and marketing providers, social networks, and

            may also collect information you as the adult have authorized the social networking service to share with us
            (such as your user ID, public profile information, email address, birthday, friends list, and pages you have
            “liked”). We may aggregate the characteristics and browsing habits of users, on an anonymized
            basis,
            to provide products and services that are more tailored. We may also receive your information when a user
            provides us with your contact information as part of a referral feature.

            sources, both online and offline, and use such combined information in accordance with this Privacy
            Policy.
Aggregate/De-identified Information
We may aggregate and/or de-identify any information
            collected through the Services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device
            (“Aggregate/De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any
            purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with
            any
            third parties in our discretion.
LEGAL BASES FOR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
The laws of some jurisdictions, including the European
            Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”), require that companies only
            process
            your “Personal Data” (as that term is defined in the applicable law, like the EU General Data
            Protection Regulation) if they have a “legal basis” (or justifiable need) for processing your
            Personal Data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal bases for processing Personal Data are as
            follows:
To perform our obligations pursuant to a contract (or pending contract) with you.
                For example, we will process your Personal Data to comply with our
Terms
                    of Use
to enter into a
                contract with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.
For our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. For example,
                we will process your Personal Data to: operate our business and our Services; identify and fix any
                issues
                with our Services; provide customer service; secure the Services; learn more about how our customers use
                the
                Services; perform internal analytics; improve the Services and users’ experiences; conduct
                marketing;
                provide you with certain information about new products, special offers or other information that we
                think
                you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided in accordance with applicable
                law;
                make and receive payments; comply with legal requirements and defend our legal rights; prevent fraud;
                engage
                in a business change (e.g., sale, merger); and to know the customer to whom we are providing
                Services.
To comply with our legal obligations, such as our obligation to share data with
                tax authorities.
With your consent. Where we rely on this basis, you may have the right to withdraw
                your consent at any time as described in the “Data Protection Rights, Information, and
                Choices”
                section below.
COOKIES & SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
To collect the information in the “
Information We Collect Through Automated
            Means
” section above, we and our service providers use web server logs, cookies, tags,
            SDKs, tracking pixels, localstorage and similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies to improve
            our
            Services and in order to offer you as the adult a more tailored experience in the future.
A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.
An SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our applications and
                software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the
                Services.
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device
                when
                you use the Services, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and
                settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv), enhance your user
                experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your
                interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative
                functions.
                Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored
                with
                your Adobe Flash Player files.
Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny
                electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email that are designed
                to:
                (1) collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates; (2) measure popularity
                of
                the Services and associated advertising; and (3) access user cookie.
LocalStorage is a web storage object for storing data on the client –
                that
                is, locally, on your computer. Data stored locally has no expiration date and will exist until it's been
                deleted.
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather
            information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set
            or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser

            offerings of

            analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) as well as self hosted data collection services on
            our
            Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar technologies; engage in
            auditing,

Advertising.
We may work with
            a
            number of companies that assist in marketing our services to you, as the adult, on third party websites,
            mobile
            apps, and online services. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies
            to
            collect information about your use of certain parts of the Services and your activities across other
            websites
            and online services, which they may associate with persistent identifiers. Sometimes, these identifiers may
            be
            derived from a hashed or encrypted version of personal information such as your email address. We may use
            this
            information to measure the performance of our advertising as well, for instance, to evaluate which ads or
            content our users prefer, or which are most effective. In addition, sometimes we or an advertising partner
            may
            tailor advertising to you across different devices.
Their activities and your choices regarding their use of
            your information to personalize ads to you are subject to and set out in their own policies. We neither have
            access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may
            be
            placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device
by non-affiliated, third-party providers. As described
            below, these providers may offer you a way to opt-out of the collection of information that is used for our
            interest-based advertising to you. We cannot guarantee that these instructions will not change, or that they
            will continue to be available; they are controlled by each
third-party service provider, not us.
We do not use Child Activity
            Information to direct or personalize advertisements, do not
            advertise to children, and do not present third-party advertising within the Services.
If you are interested in more information about interest-based advertising and how
            you
            can generally control cookies other tracking technologies from being put on your computer to deliver such
            advertising, you may visit the

Notice Concerning Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy
            preference that users can set in
            certain
            web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on
            our
            website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.
            Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT
            signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals. Learn more about

Rights with Respect to Your Information
Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights
            with respect to your information. For example, under local laws, including in the EEA, UK, and Canada, you
            may
            have some or all the following rights:
The right to access personal information we hold about you.
The right to have any inaccurate personal information we hold about you corrected
                or updated.
The right to object to our processing of your personal information or prevent the
                processing your personal information for direct-marketing purposes.
The right to withdraw your consent at any time if and to the extent we are relying
                on consent as the basis for processing your personal information.
The right to restrict the use of your personal information.
The right to have the personal information we hold about you deleted in certain
                circumstances.
The right to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to
                request that we transfer it to a third party, with certain exceptions.
If you are a California resident, please see the “Privacy Information for
            California Residents” section below for information about your specific rights and how to exercise
            them
            under California law.
For residents of other jurisdictions, to exercise your data protection rights or to
            receive more details in connection with them, you can submit requests via
privacy@homerapp.com
.
You may be required to provide additional
            information necessary to confirm your identity before we can respond to your request.
We will consider all such requests and provide our
            response within the time period required by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information
            may
            be exempt from such requests, for example if we need to keep the information to comply with our own legal
            obligations or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. Your rights and our responses will vary based
            on
            your state or country of residency. Please note that you may be located in a jurisdiction where we are not
            obligated, or are unable, to fulfill a request. In such a case, your request may not be fulfilled.
If applicable, you may make a complaint to your local data
            protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy
            through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.
Identifying the Data Controller
Data protection laws in certain jurisdictions
            differentiate between the “controller” and “processor” of information. Conscious
            Content
            Media Inc. is the controller of data collected in relation to your use of the Services, such as information
            collected or maintained in relation to a user’s account, Device and Usage Data (including, internet or
            other network or device activity, Services metadata, log data, location information), cookie information,
            and
            other information provided to us.
Privacy Information for California Residents
California Privacy Rights
Terms used in this section and not otherwise defined have
            the meaning given to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act
            (“
CCPA
”).
California law requires us to provide some additional
            information regarding your rights with respect to your “personal information.” In many cases, if
            you
            are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information.
            Specifically, unless certain exceptions apply, the CCPA allows you to request us to:
Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose
                about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for
                collecting
                your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal
                information.
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about
                you.
Delete certain personal information we have about you.
Provide you with information about certain financial incentives that we offer to
                you, if any.
You also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be
            subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.
We reserve the right to verify your identity before
            responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information
            you
            are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, phone number, or
            other information. You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on
            your
            behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed,
            written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify
            your
            identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.
Please note that certain information may be exempt from
            such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the
            Services to
            you or to comply with legal obligations, so we would need to either reject your request to delete the
            information or, if we are legally permitted to delete it, we would need to terminate our provision of the
            Services to you after deleting it. If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under
            California law or would like to exercise any of them, please email
privacy@homerapp.com.
Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Californian’s
                Personal Information
During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of
            this Privacy Policy, we collected (and continue to collect) all of the categories of information listed in
            the
            chart below and described in the “
Information We
Collect”
section of our Privacy Policy. That section also explains the sources from
            which we collect information about you, including, for example, you, service providers, other users,
            Partners,
            analytics providers, cookies and tracking technologies, survey partners, and marketing partners.
The “
How We Use Information
”
section of this Privacy Policy explains how
            and why we use your personal information. Generally speaking, we use your information to provide our
            Services,
            manage and verify your account, offer and personalize the Services, bill, remit, charge, and process
            payments,
            send communications, provide customer service, analyze, research, develop, and improve the Services, enforce
            legal terms and defend our rights, investigate and prevent security issues, fraud, and abuse, comply with
            laws,
            and as described when collecting your information.
We share certain information as set forth in
            “
How We Share Information
”
section and in the chart below, and we
            allow third parties to collect certain information about your activity, for example through cookies, as
            explained in the “Cookies & Similar Technologies” section. Consistent with applicable laws,
            we
            may share Aggregate/De-Identified Information with third parties.
California residents may opt out of the “sale”
            of their personal information. California law broadly defines “sale” in a way that may include
            allowing third parties to receive certain information such as cookies, IP address and/or browsing behavior
            for
            interest-based advertising or related purposes. Although HOMER does not currently sell personal information
            in
            exchange for any monetary consideration, we may share personal information for these purposes in such a way
            that
            could be deemed a “sale” as defined by the CCPA. We also share certain information as set forth
            in
            “Cookies & Similar Technologies” section. For details on how to opt out of cookies, please
            see
            the “Cookies & Similar Technologies” section.
If you or your authorized agent would like to opt out of
            HOMER’s use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under the
            CCPA,
            you may do so as outlined on the following page:
Do Not Sell My
Personal Information
. Please note that we do not knowingly sell Child Activity
            Information or the personal
            information of minors under 16 years of age.
In the 12 months since the effective date of this Privacy
            Policy, we made the following disclosures of personal information about California residents:

California “Shine the Light” Disclosure
The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the
            right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information
            (as
            defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share
            your
            personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes within the meaning of that
            law.
Privacy Rights for Nevada Residents
Under Nevada law, certain Nevada residents may opt out of
            the “sale” of “covered information” (as such term is defined under Nevada law) for
            monetary consideration. We do not engage in such activity as of the effective date of this Privacy
            Policy.
PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
This Privacy Policy is subject to change. We reserve the
            right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection
            and
            use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. We encourage you to review this
            Privacy
            Policy frequently for any revisions or amendments. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be made accessible
            through use of the Services with an updated “Last Revised” date. If we make material changes to
            how
            we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age, we will, where
            necessary, notify you more prominently and/or obtain your prior consent, including parental consent. For all
            other changes you will be deemed to have been made aware of and have accepted the changes by your continued
            use
            of our Services.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
HOMER adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection
            Act (“COPPA”). COPPA is a law in the United States that regulates the way in which online
            websites
            may collect and use information from children. We do not collect or use information in a manner that is
            inconsistent with the COPPA. For more information on the COPPA please review the
rule
or consult this simple
one-page informational guide
from the
            kidSAFE Seal Program.
COPPA requires that we inform parents and legal guardians
            about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that
            we
            obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain
            features
            of our Services. HOMER is kidSAFE COPPA Certified. This means that the product has been independently,
            reviewed,
            and certified by kidSAFE to meet certain standards of online safety and privacy, and is authorized to
            display the
            kidSAFE Seal under kidSAFE’s FTC approved COPPA Safe Harbor program. Under the kidSAFE program users
            can
            also report concerns or complaints

As described in the “
Information We
            Collect
”
section above, we collect Child Activity Information, device and account
            information, and automatically collected information while children use the Services.
As described in the “
How We Use
            Information
” section
            above, we use this information to: (i) measure the child’s performance in activities; (ii) adapt the
            learning experience to their needs; (iii) assess the child’s progress and provide reports to the
            relevant
            adults on children’s performance on activities; (iv) analyze use of
the Services and improve the content, functionality, and
            usability of the Services, enhance the user experience, and improve our business; (v) comply with any
            procedures, laws, and regulations where necessary for our legitimate interests or legitimate interests of
            others; (vi) understand, detect, and resolve problems with the Services and other issues being reported;
            (vii)
            comply with any procedures, laws, and regulations where necessary for our legitimate interests or legitimate
            interests of others; (viii) establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights where necessary for our
            legitimate
            interests or the legitimate interests of others, including the enforcement of our Terms of Use, other usage
            policies and agreements, and other legal terms or controls, or to engage in other legal matters; and (ix)
            fulfill
            other requests with the relevant adult’s consent.
As described in the “
How We Share Information”
section
            above, we may share this information with
            hosting, maintenance, data storage, analytics, customer service, security and fraud prevention, and similar
            service providers, Partners, and others in connection with business transfers, to comply with laws, protect
            our
            rights, and the rights of others, and with the appropriate adult’s consent. Our Services do not allow
            children to make personal information publicly available.
As stated in the “Data Protection Rights,
            Information, and Choices” section above, parents or legal guardians may contact HOMER to review their
            child’s information, keep their child’s information accurate, current, and complete, delete
            their
            child’s information, or restrict us from further collecting or using your child’s
            information.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Your personal information may be transferred to, stored
            in, accessed from, or processed in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we or our service
            providers
            maintain facilities. You understand that these jurisdictions may have different data protection regimes than
            in
            the country in which you are located.
Where legally required, we will use an adequate transfer
            method. For example, whenever we transfer your personal information from an entity in the EEA and UK to the
            United States, we may use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give
            personal
            information the same protection it has in Europe or rely on another adequate mechanism. Where applicable,
            you
            are entitled, upon request, to receive a copy of the relevant safeguard
            (
e.g.
, EC standard contractual clauses)
            that have been taken to protect personal information during such transfer. For a copy of the relevant
            safeguard
            please contact us using the information in the

section below.

The categories of sources from which we collect personal information and our business and
        commercial purposes for using personal information are set forth in "Personal Information We
        Collect" and "How We Use Your Personal Information" above, respectively.
"Sales" of Personal Information under the CCPA
For purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act, we do not "sell" your personal information,
        nor do we have actual knowledge of any "sale" of personal information of minors under 16 years
        of age, as the term "sell" is commonly understood. That said, we do share information with
        third-party advertisers for the purpose of promoting our Services. To the extent that such
        sharing is considered a "sale" under the CCPA, you may opt-out of having your information shared
        by disabling third-party cookies on your device, or by contacting us as set forth in "Contact
        Us" below.
If you are a California resident, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by
        Little Passports for the exercise of your rights conferred by the California Consumer Privacy
        Act.
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
        request related to your personal information. To designate an authorized agent, please contact
        us as set forth in "Contact Us" below and provide written authorization signed by you and your
        designated agent. When you make a request, we will ask you to provide sufficient information
        that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal
        information or an authorized representative, which may include asking you to answer questions
        regarding your account and use of our Services.
As described above in
How We Use Your Personal Information
("Referral or Shared
        Content"), we may offer referral programs or other incentivized data collection programs. For
        example, we may offer incentives to you such as discounts,promotional items, or credit in
        connection with these programs, where you provide your personal information in exchange for a
        reward or provide personal information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email
        address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. In some instances, the
        referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral. These programs are
        entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The
        value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of
        the referred party's data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a User
        and uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with
        each program.
This Privacy Policy uses industry-standard technologies and was developed in line with the World

        calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties.
Where required by law, California residents under the age of 18 may request to have their posted
        content or information removed from the publicly viewable portions of the Services by contacting
        us directly as set forth in "Contact Us" below or logging into their account and removing the

codeSpark Privacy Policy
At codeSpark ("codeSpark" "We" or "Us") we care very much about your privacy. As creators of apps for
        children, we aim to follow the best practices as specified by the "Know what's inside" program and the
kidSAFE Seal
                Program
, and comply with The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). To learn
        more about COPPA, please reference this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal
        Program:
www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html
.
We strive to be upfront, so there are no hidden surprises. This Privacy Policy describes the ways in
        which codeSpark. Inc. (collectively, "Company" or "We") collects, uses and discloses information about
        users of the codeSpark websites (the "Site"), game applications ("Apps") and online products and
        services that link to this policy (collectively, the "Services"). By using the Services you agree to the
        handling of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
A few key points up front:
Please review the "
Children's Privacy
" section below for details on codeSpark's limited collection and use of data collected from and about children.
During registration we ask only for the barest minimum of information from an adult teacher or
            parent. From our children student users (under 13), the Services will never require full names or
            addresses; we ask only for a generic user name, which can be a nickname or a first name.
With respect to all student data, our practices are particularly strict, as we describe below.
Other than the fees for purchasing a subscription for the Services, where applicable, there are no
            in app purchases needed to play.
We are compliant with FERPA and COPPA
You have the right to request a copy to review and delete the information We have collected about
            you at any time.
The Services do not include any pop up ads or other third party advertisements.
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
In the course of providing our Services, We collect certain information. Some of the information is the
        information you voluntarily provide to us, like an email address. Other information We collect
        automatically as you use the Services, like your login in activities. We only collect your information
        in furtherance of our legitimate interest of providing you with the Services, and internally to evaluate
        our efforts to improve the Services, and we do not sell this information.
Automatic Collection
: Like most digital companies, we may use common technologies such as
        cookies and other technologies to better understand users' interactions with the Services. These
        technologies help us keep track of user behavior, tell us which parts of our Services people have
        visited and are using, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of activities. If you use any of our
        Services, we may also collect data related to the device on which the App is loaded. In particular, for
        analytics, we are using third party services of Mixpanel and Google Analytics. They store this data
        securely and do not share it with anyone else. We are using a restricted version of their analytics
        product designed for use with apps for children, meaning that the anonymous data created from our Apps
        isn't used anywhere else in their system, it's only for us to improve the apps, including information on
        App crashes, usage time, games played and problems missed.
Volunteered
: In order for you to use the Services, a teacher or parent must create an account.
        This account safeguards the work you create on codeSpark, allows you access your work across multiple
        devices, and allows multiple related people to use the Services on the same device. When you (parents
        and teachers) create an account, register with us, send us an email, or provide other information with
        us in any other way, we will collect and store the information you share. You do not have to share this
        information with us, but without it, you may not be able to access certain features or participate in
        certain aspects of the Services.
The Services may enable you to input first names or nicknames for student and children players, which
        allow you to set up multiple profiles on a single device. The Apps will track each child's play data
        separately to provide personalized activities and levels for each profile. Only parents or educators may
        sign up for a parent or school account by entering through a parental gate. When you sign up for a
        parent account, we collect and verify the parent's email address so we can notify you about your
        child(ren)'s activities when using the Apps. With such an account, we provide to you additional
        services, such as multiple profiles, your child's progress reports and additional resources. The Profile
        Names, zip code level location, along with birth month and year, will be collected in order to
        personalize your reports.
The Services will collect student play data thru persistent identifiers that are then linked to
        individual student nicknames or first names (not full names). This allows us to provide progress
        reports. Information collected from our Services is used for internal purposes to provide and improve
        the Services and for use and benefit of the students, schools, and parents only. We rely on teachers and
        schools to obtain parental consents if and when they are necessary.
Additional Protections and Information for School Accounts
Educational Use; Student Data. We collect a bare minimum of personally identifiable information (Personal
        Information as defined below) from the parents and teachers as necessary for students to establish an
        account. For school accounts and school-based services, a school administrator or educator signs up for
        a school account, whereupon we collect the administrator's or educator's name, email address, school
        name and city. An educator sets up student nicknames or first names and accessibility options. Students
        are only identified by a nickname or first name and then associated with the teacher for their work
        through the Services (student first names and their work on the Services are collectively, "Student
        Data"). The Services allow the students to create games and interact with the Services but only in a
        de-identified way. Students who use the story telling feature can submit pictures or text, so long as
        those features do not involve any Personal information, and those pictures and text features are not
        made publically accessible. With respect to student data in particular, We commit to protect student
        data additionally as follows
Student data collected from our Services is evaluated and used only to provide the Services and for
            use and benefit of the students, schools, and parents only. ACCORDINGLY, CODESPARK WILL NOT, USE ANY
            STUDENT DATA IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES.
We commit to maintaining the confidentiality and security of all student data in accordance with all
            applicable state and U.S. federal regulations, including, without limitation, the Family Educational
            Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA").
CodeSpark will not sell or lease any student data for any advertising, marketing, or other purposes.
We will keep student data only as long as it continues to be part of our providing the Services and
            to maintain a record of our means to communicate with users. Once a teacher or school terminates its
            subscription or goes inactive, we will retain those records for not longer than 24 months from
            termination or inactivation.
We will delete, or if requested by the educational institution, transfer to the educational
            institution, all respective student data within 90 days) or a shorter time if required by applicable
            law) following termination of our agreement with the educational institution
Third Party Analytics
: This Site uses third party services to assist us with marketing to previous
        visitors to our Sites, including Google's services which enable re-marketing on the Google search
        results pages or websites in Google's networks. The Services use cookies or web beacons to serve ads
        based on someone's prior web browsing history to then show ads and other reminders that you visited. The
        Services also collect information about your internet browsing, such as your ISP, the browser you used
        to visit our Sites and whether you have Flash installed. Any such data collected will be used in
        accordance with this privacy policy. Student Data is not shared with third parties for marketing or to
        serve ads to students.
Publicly Posted
: If you post information on public areas of the Site, which are intended for
        grown-ups only (i.e. comments or blog), that information is visible to and may be collected, stored and
        used by anyone. We recommend you be cautious about giving out Personal Information to others or sharing
        such information in public or online forums. We are not responsible for the actions of any third parties
        with whom you share any Personal Information.
Credit Cards
: You can become a subscriber by purchasing a subscription to the Services within
        the Apps, where allowed by the App marketplace partners. When You subscribe to our Services, the order
        process may request a credit card or other payment information (i.e. PayPal). Order information is done
        through the Sites or via iTunes and Android App Stores directly and we do not collect or process or
        store any of your Personal Information or credit card information during the billing process ourselves.
        We use a third party service provider to process payments made on our Sites. Sales made via the app
        itself are processed through the marketplace partners directly (i.e. iTunes or Google Play), so your
        credit card information is not collected and retained by Us.
HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
We collect and use your information to provide the Services, to provide support for the Services, to
        respond to user requests and inquiries, to provide you information about codeSpark and the Services and
        other information that may be of interest to you, to maintain a record of our dealings with users, to
        facilitate your use of and our administration and operation of the Services; and to evaluate how to
        improve our offerings.
WHEN DO WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION
Personal Information may be shared with a vendor who is helping us make the Services available and
        functional under contract and with safeguards. These include third-party vendors, technical agents,
        subcontractors, and our affiliates and consultants who assist us in performing functions to operate our
        Services. These functions include, for example, web site hosting, maintenance, data analysis, customer
        support, email delivery services, infrastructure services, customer service, technical agents, analytics
        and metrics services. These third parties will be restricted in the way they can use your Personal
        Information: they can only use our Information to provide services to Us in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy and they need to keep your information confidential and secure. We do not allow third parties to
        otherwise use any Student Data.
Personally identifiable information, or Personal Data as such term is defined by GDPR below ("Personal
        Information"), is information that can identify you or your child individually, such as an individual's
        full name or physical mail address. Your Personal information may be shared as follows:
Personal Information may be shared with a vendor who is helping us make the Services available and
        functional under contract and with safeguards. These include third-party vendors, technical agents,
        subcontractors, and our affiliates and consultants who assist us in performing functions to operate our
        Services. These functions include, for example, web site hosting, maintenance, data analysis, customer
        support, email delivery services, infrastructure services, customer service, technical agents, analytics
        and metrics services. These third parties will be restricted in the way they can use your Personal
        Information and will need to keep your information confidential and secure and otherwise in accordance
        with this Privacy Policy.
We may also share Personal Information in a confidential and secure way during due diligence or in
        preparation for or after a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial
        assets, reorganization or liquidation. If codeSpark or its assets is purchased, all associated data and
        information will be transferred, provided the acquirer will be required to honor the terms of our then
        current privacy policy, as such may be updated from time to time.
If you give us permission, we may share the Personal Information of an adult account holder (teachers and
        parents) with third parties who might send you marketing and promotional information.
We may also disclose the Personal Information of an adult account holder (teachers and parents) if
        permitted or required by law or where we believe such action is necessary in order to protect or defend
        our interests or the interests of our users or business partners.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
This Site may be accessible to children but the Site is targeted for parents and adults and is not
        intended for children under age 13. For the most part, when children use our Apps, we do not require any
        Personal Information from them, and we have taken steps so that information about a child/student
        requested from a parent/teacher is non-Personal Information such as a nickname or child's first name and
        last initial only. We may give teachers the option to provide a parent's email address for each student
        user so that we can inform parents of their child's activities when using our Apps.
Collection of Personal Information that is directed to children under 13 ("Children's Platforms") is
        governed by the principles of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), a U.S. law
        designed to protect the online privacy of children under the age of 13. We will obtain parental consent
        before collecting any Personal Information on our Services, unless the request for information falls
        within an exception that would be permitted under COPPA. We do not condition a child's participation in
        our Services on the disclosure of more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate
        in an activity.
The Services contain a story creation tool that allows kid coders to create personalized, interactive
        stories. The story creation tool enables kid coders to include recorded voices, upload photos, and type
        in speech bubbles to bring characters to life. Users can also share their interactive stories in the Kid
        Community space in our Services. The Kid Community is only available to users of our Services. In order
        to enable these stories to be shared in our Kid Community and across devices of a user's account, we
        will store this content on our servers. These photos, voices and typed words that users provide may
        constitute Personal Information (for example, a child's voice) and will be stored on our servers as part
        of making the tool available and functional in our Services.
Prior to making stories available in the Kid Community, story creations are submitted first to our
        moderator. A trained moderator will review content to avoid the posting of images, text or voices or
        other content that identifies a child or that reveals other personally identifying information (such as
        a complete home address) of student/child users. Our moderator will also review materials and remove
        other unacceptable content such as anything obscene, profane or harassing. While we will make efforts to
        monitor the story creation content in our Services, we also recommend that you talk to your child about
        what you are comfortable with them sharing via photo, voice and typing on this space. We ask that
        teachers and parents also monitor player usage for any unacceptable or personally identifiable
        information.
Parents and teachers may also at any time turn off the ability to utilize the uploading of photos, voice
        and words in story creation, by going into the parent portal settings.
Parents may contact us (at
privacy@codespark.com
) to review,
        update or delete any of their children's personal information that we may have collected and to elect
        for us not to collect any additional personal information from their children.

Personal Information You
            Provide:
You may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information when you sign up for an account or a newsletter
        on one of our Platforms, when you contact us for information about Sesame Workshop or one of our programs, when
        you use some of our Apps, when you register for and/or attend Sesame Workshop events (such as our annual
        fundraising gala), or when you participate in Sesame Workshop programs.  The Personal Information we
        request may include:
Contact information, including your name, postal address, telephone number, or email address;
Payment information, such as your name, last four digits of a credit card number (credit card payments are
            processed by a third-party Service Provider (defined below)), telephone number, and billing address, when
            you make a donation to Sesame Workshop;
Information regarding your donation history, donation amount, and your charitable interests;
Basic information about your family and children.
It is always your choice whether to provide us your Personal Information and we will always expressly ask you in
        advance of collecting such information. However, depending upon the activity, some Personal Information will be
        mandatory for participation, and we will indicate it as such. If you do not provide the mandatory Personal
        Information with respect to an activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
Some of our Platforms are intended for children under the age of 13 (we refer to these individuals as a "Child"
        or "Children"). If we learn that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a Child on any of our
        Platforms that are not intended for Children, we will take steps to promptly delete that information.
For information about our collection of Personal Information from Children, on the Platforms that are intended
        for Children, please refer to the "
Sesame Workshop Children's Privacy
".
Information We Collect Automatically
We, and our Service Providers (defined below), automatically collect certain information when you visit or
        interact with the Platforms. Such information may include, among other things, the Uniform Resource Locator
        ("
URL
") from which you arrived, the URL to which you next go, browser information, Internet
        Protocol addresses, a mobile device identifier, type of operating system,  general location data such as a
        city or zip code.  We, and our Service Providers, also collect information about your use of the Platforms
        such as the pages or sections you visit most frequently, the time you spend there, and how you move through the
        Platform. We refer to this type of information as "
Usage Information
".  We collect Usage
        Information directly from your device through the use of cookies, web beacons, third party analytics providers,
        or other similar technologies.
A "cookie" is a small data file that a web site transfers to a user's device and is stored on the user's browser.
        As a user moves from one page or one screen to another, a cookie is used to tell us that it is the same device
        and to remember your preferences. A "web beacon" (also referred to as a "clear gif" or "pixel tag") is a
        one-pixel image (which may be visible or transparent), which may be embedded on a web page or in an e-mail
        message, and which may also provide us with information about usage of that page or e-mail message, including if
        and when you have opened it.
We use Usage Information to help us administer the Platforms, remember your preferences, deliver content that may
        be of interest to you, diagnose technical problems, and to support our security efforts. We also analyze the
        information to understand aggregate trends about how our Platforms are used, to help us better understand the
        makeup of our Platform users, and to help us improve our Platforms.
When Usage Information is in a form that would be considered Personal Information, we use it in accordance with
        the representations made in this Privacy Policy.
Third Party Cookies and Tracking
We use third party service providers to help us collect and understand Usage Information and to support our
        marketing efforts. A list of companies that host cookies on our Platforms, the services they provide, and
        information on how you may opt out of certain cookies is included in our
Cookie
            Notice
. Most browsers can be set to detect and provide the option to reject browser cookies, but doing
        so may affect certain features of the Platforms. You may make choices about cookies placed by us or our third
        parties on our Platforms by visiting the "Cookie Preferences" link at the bottom of each page on our
        Sites.  If you do not or if you no longer want to have cookies placed on your browser by third parties,
        many of them also offer ways to opt out. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete
        them, refer to the "Tools," "Help," or similar section of your web browser.
We do not serve targeted advertising on our Platforms. However, when you use the Internet, third parties that we
        are not affiliated with may use tracking technologies, including cookies and pixels, to collect information
        about your online activities over time and across our Platforms and other websites. They may use this
        information to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and to serve you advertisements that may be of
        interest to you elsewhere on the Internet. Currently, our websites do not respond to "do not track" signals
        transmitted by web browsers. "Do Not Track" is different from the Global Privacy Control (GPC), which we do
        respond to in certain territories. To find out more about GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
.
For more information about third party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, visit the
        NAI's consumer website at

or

, or

.  If you do want to opt out using
        these tools, you need to opt out separately for each of your devices and for each web browser that you use on
        each device.
Personal Information Received from Third Parties
We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources, including our data broker services, data
        enhancement companies, list rental services, third-party analytics providers, and social media-owned databases,
        including via your interaction with our social media pages (this includes aggregate data on our social media
        followers (e.g., age, gender and location), engagement data (e.g., "likes," comments, shares, reposts
        and clicks), awareness data (e.g., number of impressions and reach) and individual users' public
        profiles). We may also collect certain donation information from our Service Providers, including past donation
        history, amount donated each time, and frequency of donations.
In addition, we may obtain certain information from our licensees, including name, address, and payment
        information, to generate a profile of users who interact with our licensees.
Personal Information We Create or Generate
We may also infer certain Personal Information from any combination of the information that we collect directly
        or that we receive from third-parties, including using automated means to generate information about your likely
        preferences or other characteristics.
In all cases, we will only use your Personal Information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

Security of Your Personal Information
We implement and maintain technical and organizational measures to help secure your Personal Information. We host
        Personal Information in secure, cloud-based environments that use firewalls, encryption and other
        industry-standard technologies in an effort to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.

        disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.

        application or service, the use of your information by the third party will be governed by that party's privacy
        policy.
SESAME WORKSHOP CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
We strive to operate our Children's Platforms in alignment with the principles of the Children's Online Privacy
        Protection Act ("COPPA").
Information We Request on Our Children's Platforms
We will not ask a child to provide us with more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate
        in any Platform activity or service.  For certain activities, there may be a "Share with a Friend" option
        where children can provide their first name, a friend's first name, and friend's email address to send a feature
        from a Children's Platform to the friend via email. We use such Personal Information only to fulfill the child's
        request and do not store that Personal Information for any longer than reasonably necessary to send the relevant
        email.
In the future, should we request Personal Information from a child in a manner that requires prior, verifiable
        consent from a parent, we will notify you of that change by updating this privacy policy and will implement
        practices that align with the requirements of COPPA.
If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a Child without the legally
        required prior, verifiable parental consent, regardless of where in the world they are located, we will delete
        that information promptly.
Information We Collect Automatically on Our Children's Platforms
We automatically collect certain information from visitors to our Children's Platforms to help us understand
        trends about our Children's Platforms are used. This helps us to maintain and administer the Children's
        Platforms, including to support our security efforts, to make improvements, and to understand aggregated
        information about the makeup of our visitors.
We use certain Service Providers to help us collect and understand this information. The information might
        include, for example, the Uniform Resource Locator ("
URL
") from which the visitor arrived, the
        URL to which you next go, browser information, Internet Protocol addresses, a mobile device identifier,
        operating system, or general location data such as a city or zip code, as well as information about use of the
        Children's Platforms, such as the pages or sections visited most often, the time spent there, and how a visitor
        moves through the Children's Platform.  When this information is considered to be Personal Information, we
        treat it in accordance with this section of the privacy policy.
We and our service providers collect this information directly from the device through the use of cookies, web
        beacons, or other similar technologies. A "cookie" is a small data file that a web site transfers to a user's
        device and is stored on the user's browser. As a user moves from one page or one screen to another, a cookie is
        used to tell us that it is the same device and to remember your preferences. A "web beacon" (also referred to as
        a "clear gif" or "pixel tag") is a one-pixel image (which may be visible or transparent), which may be embedded
        on a web page or in an e-mail message, and which may also provide us with information about usage of that page
        or e-mail message, including if and when you have opened it. More information about the cookies used in our
        Children's Platform is available in our Cookie Notice.
Most browsers allow you to control placement of cookies by third parties on your browser. To learn more about
        cookies and how to manage or delete them, refer to the "Tools," "Help," or similar section of your web
        browser.
How We Use and Share Personal Information Collected on Our Children's
            Platforms
We use Personal Information collected from children to operate our business, such as to administer and maintain
        our Children's Platforms and in support of our Children's Platform internal operations, in accordance with
        consent provide by a parent, and to comply with our legal obligations, and otherwise as described above.
We contract with third parties to provide certain services and to facilitate the internal operations of our
        Children's Platforms, such as data hosting, analytics, and content delivery. These third parties may require
        access to certain Personal Information, only in order to provide their services.
Managing Personal Information Collected on Our Children's Platforms
Parents may contact us at
dotorgmail@sesame.org
with requests to review, update or delete any of their
        Children's Personal Information that we may have collected, to revoke any consent that had been previously
        provided, and to elect for us not to collect any additional Personal Information from their children. 
        Please be aware that we may request additional Personal Information in order to verify your identity and your
        relationship to the Child before we can proceed with your request, particularly a request to access a Child's
        Personal Information. We will use any such Personal Information only to validate the request. We will fulfill
        any valid request to review, update or delete any such Personal Information within a reasonable time period.
Security of Information Collected on Our Children's Platforms
We implement and maintain technical and organizational measures to help secure Personal Information collected
        through our Children's Platforms. We host Personal Information in secure, cloud-based environments that use
        firewalls, encryption and other industry-standard technologies in an effort to prevent interference or access
        from outside intruders.
While we strive to maintain the security of your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that information
        security measures are fail-safe or guarantee that Personal Information on a Platform may not be accessed,
        disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.
For information about storage of Children's Personal Information or cross-border transfers, please see the
        section on, "
How We Store and Process Your Personal Information.

COOKIE NOTICE
As noted above, we use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, to collect and store
        information when you visit our Platforms. A "cookie" is a small data file that a web site transfers to a user's
        device and is stored on the user's browser. As a user moves from one page or one screen to another, a cookie is
        used to tell us that it is the same device and to remember your preferences. A "web beacon" (also referred to as
        a "clear gif" or "pixel tag") is a one-pixel image (which may be visible or transparent), which may be embedded
        on a web page or in an e-mail message, and which may also provide us with information about usage of that page
        or e-mail message, including if and when you have opened it.
Types of Cookies We Use
We might use both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies last for as long as you are using your browser,
        while persistent cookies will last for some time after you close your browser. The time that persistent cookies
        last is dependent on your browser configuration and the lifespan of each cookie.
These cookies may be "first party" cookies, which are served by us, or "third party" cookies, which are served by
        a domain other than ours. While allow third parties to access the Platforms to place cookies on users' devices,
        the information those cookies supply is controlled by the third party and subject to their privacy policy.
The Platforms use four types of cookies: essential, functional, analytics, and marketing cookies.
Marketing cookies are not served on our Children's Platforms.
Essential Cookies:  These are required to use our Platforms and to access certain features. Where
        applicable, the legal basis for use of essential cookies is our legitimate interest to operate our Platforms.
Functional Cookies:  These help us to store choices and settings you make, such as your country or account
        preferences. If you disable these cookies, the functionality of the Platforms may be affected. Where applicable,
        the legal basis for the collection of information through functionality cookies is your consent.
Analytics Cookies: These allow us to collect information to help us understand how our Platforms are used and the
        nature of our user base. This includes whether a user has made prior visits to a Platform, usage of the
        Platform, and areas on the Platforms that are most often visited. This allows us to improve the performance of
        the Platforms and your experience. Where applicable, the legal basis for the collection of such information by
        analytics cookies is your consent.
Marketing Cookies: Marketing cookies provide us with some of the same information that we collect from analytics
        cookies, and also allow us to serve advertising about our organization that we believe may interest you after
        you have visited our Platforms, and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising. If you disable these
        cookies you will not receive advertising based on your visits to our Platforms. Where applicable, the legal
        basis for the collection of such information by analytics and advertising cookies is your consent.
How We Use Cookies
We use the information that is automatically collected through cookies to support our operations, analysis, and
        promotion of the Platforms. This includes the following:
to monitor metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic;
to understand which activities and services are most popular;
to understand the pages where visitors enter our Sites and the pages viewed;
to understand generally the location of our users (
e.g.
, zip code information);
to recognize the browsers used to visit our Platforms, so that the content is adapted for the relevant
            browser; and
to diagnose and fix technology problems
to reduce the repetition in the promotional messages that users see on our Platforms that are not intended
            for Children;
Disabling, Deleting, or Opting Out of Cookies
You may visit the "Cookie Preferences" link at the bottom of each page on our Sites  to make choices about

Tracking Tools, Advertising and Opt-Out
The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs and JavaScript
        (collectively, "Cookies") to enable our servers to recognize your web browser, tell us how and when you
        visit and use our Services, analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services.
        Cookies are small pieces of data– usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone or similar
        device when you use that device to access our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect
        from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own
        Cookies on your device(s). Please note that because of our use of Cookies, the Services do not support "Do
        Not Track" requests sent from a browser at this time.
We use the following types of Cookies:
Essential Cookies.
Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services
            that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our
            Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.
Functional Cookies.
Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our
            Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These
            Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for
            example, your choice of language or region).
Performance/Analytical Cookies.
Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how
            visitors use our Services. They do this by collecting information about the number of visitors to the
            Services, what pages visitors view on our Services and how long visitors are viewing pages on the
            Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising
            campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services' content for those who engage with
            our advertising. For example, Google Inc. ("Google") uses cookies in connection with its Google
            Analytics services. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about
            your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy
            Policy. You have the option to opt-out of Google's use of Cookies by visiting the Google advertising
            opt-out page at www.google.com/privacy_ads.html or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at
            https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. You have the option to opt out of Mixpanel's analytics
            services by visiting https://mixpanel.com/optout/. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a
            new browser, delete or otherwise alter your browser's cookie file (including upgrading browsers), you
            may clear the Mixpanel opt-out cookie. If you would like more information on the type of information
            Mixpanel collects, please visit Mixpanel's Terms of Use: https://mixpanel.com/legal/terms-of-use/.
Retargeting/Advertising Cookies.
Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online
            activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to
            you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled "Information about
            Interest-Based Advertisements."
You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies through your internet browser's settings. Most browsers have
        an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as
        well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each
        new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your device. If you do
        this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit our website and some of
        the Services and functionalities may not work.

        browser's menu. To find out more information about Cookies, including information about how to manage and
        delete Cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
Information about Interest-Based Advertisements:
We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad
        agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. These
        advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain
        preferences or behaviors ("Interest-Based Ads"). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal
        Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services
        and/or services of third parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking users' activities across
        time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our
        service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network to you
        through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and
        reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements
        to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies
        on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral
        Advertising. Through the DAA and Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), several media and marketing
        associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of,
        and greater control over, ads that are customized based a consumer's online behavior across different
        websites and properties. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties,
        including to opt-out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations,
        please visit the DAA's or NAI's consumer opt-out pages, which are located at
        http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or www.aboutads.info/choices.
Data Security and Retention
We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate
        physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data
        and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and
        protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and
        browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the
        security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of
        transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.
We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary
        to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary
        to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or
        required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or
        aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
Personal Data of Children
As noted in the Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data about children under
        13 years of age; if you are a child under the age of 13, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise
        use the Services or send us any Personal Data. If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child
        under 13 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child
        under 13 years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at support@kidpass.com.
California Resident Rights
If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the "Exercising
        Your Rights" section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may
        process Personal Data of our customers' end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain
        services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact
        the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to
        such data.
If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a
        California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of
        such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to
        you, please contact us at support@kidpass.com.
Access
You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the
        past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:
The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.
The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.
The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months,
        we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient. If we
        have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data sold
        to each category of third party recipient.
Deletion
You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the
        CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to
        provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion
        request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.
Exercising Your Rights
To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request
        that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have
        collected Personal Data, specifically your KidPass login credentials, which include your email log-in and
        password, as well as the name and phone number listed on your account, and (2) describes your request in
        sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of
        these criteria will be considered a "Valid Request." We may not respond to requests that do not meet these
        criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete
        your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.
We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for
        making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we
        determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision
        before completing your request.
You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:
Call us at: (888) 465-4372
Email us at: support@kidpass.com
You may also authorize an agent (an "Authorized Agent") to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this,
        you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and
        we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your
        behalf.
Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In
We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months. To our knowledge, we do
        not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
