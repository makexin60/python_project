How Google retains data we collect
Advertising
Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox

How Google uses cookies in advertising
Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).
We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These
server logs
typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
Our advertising cookies
To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.
See more detail about the
types of cookies used by Google
and our partners and
how we use them
.
How you can control advertising cookies
You can use
ad settings
to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.
You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based
aboutads.info choices
page or the EU-based
Your Online Choices
.
Finally, you can
manage cookies in your web browser
.
Other technologies used in advertising
Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the
IP address
, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
Location
Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us.  Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:
Reset your device’s advertising ID
, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
Delete your device’s advertising ID
, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.
To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

Settings
app on your device.
Connected TV/Over-the-Top
Advertising identifiers for connected TV
Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.
The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:
Reset advertising ID
Delete advertising ID
Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
Your advertising ID (long string)
These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

.
What determines the ads by Google that I see?
Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.
Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.
Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.
The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.
You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.
Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.
We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.

Introduction
In our mission to make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use information about you, our
merchants using Shopify
to power your business
customers
who shop at a Shopify-powered business
partners
who develop apps for merchants to use, build stores on behalf of merchants, refer potential entrepreneurs to Shopify, or otherwise help merchants operate or improve their Shopify-powered business
users of Shopify apps
and services like
Shop
or
Shop Pay
visitors to
Shopify’s websites
, or anyone contacting
Shopify support
This Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect, use, and share your personal information. If we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy. If any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through the Shopify admin or by email).
Our values
Trust is the foundation of the Shopify platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy.
Your information belongs to you
We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind. In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit.
We protect your information from others
If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden.
We help merchants and partners meet their privacy obligations
Many of the merchants and partners using Shopify do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations. To do this, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way. We also provide detailed FAQs and documentation covering the most important privacy topics, and respond to privacy-related questions we receive.
Why we process your information
We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). Laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) call these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:
preventing risk and fraud
answering questions or providing other types of support
helping merchants find and use apps through our app store
providing and improving our products and services
providing reporting and analytics
testing out features or additional services
assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications
We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with certain measures—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.
We may also process your personal information where you have provided your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing, where you direct us to transfer information to a third party, where we receive your data from a third party is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities). At any time, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices, opting out from our communications or by contacting us.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, to understand our purposes for processing, categories of recipients and legal basis for processing for each type of personal data.
Your rights over your information
We believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live. Depending on how you use Shopify, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information. We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights. Please note that a number of these rights apply only in certain circumstances, and all of these rights may be limited by law.
If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchase or interaction, you need to directly contact the merchant you interacted with. We are a processor and process information on their behalf. We will of course help our merchants to fulfill these requests to the extent required by law, such as by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions.
If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with, please submit your data subject request through our
online portal
. Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond. In order to do so, we may use a third party to collect and verify identification documents. Further information about rights available to US residents can be found below under the header “United States Regional Privacy Notice”.
If you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue. If you are located in the EEA or UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection or privacy authority at any time.
Finally, because there is no common understanding about what a
“Do Not Track”
signal is supposed to mean, we don’t respond to those signals in any particular way.
Where we send your information
We are a Canadian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world. To operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country, including to the United States. This data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it. We take steps to protect your information when we send your information across borders.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant.
Transfers outside of Europe and Switzerland
If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, your personal information is controlled by our Irish affiliate, Shopify International Ltd. Your information is then sent to other Shopify locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States. When we send your personal information outside of the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law, which the European Commission has found adequately protects your information. If we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example, when we send this information to our
Subprocessors
), this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in the
Standard Contractual Clauses.
Finally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example, if we receive a valid court order). For information about how we respond to such orders, please review our
Guidelines for Legal Requests
.
How long do we retain your information
We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements. We will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies. If you stop using our services or if you delete your account with us, we will delete your information or store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format.
Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, for further details on the retention of your personal information.
Our use of Machine Learning
One of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like “machine learning” (some laws, including certain EEA and UK laws, may refer to this as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our services. When we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don’t have legal or similarly significant effects (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store).
How we protect your information
Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information. However, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You can find more information about our security measures at
/ie/security
.
How we use “cookies” and other tracking technologies
We use
cookies
and similar tracking technologies on our website and when providing our services. For more information about how we use these technologies, including a list of other companies that place cookies on our sites, a list of cookies that we place when we power a merchant’s store, and an explanation of how you can opt out of certain types of cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
How you can reach us
If you would like to ask about, make a request relating to, or complain about how we process your personal information, please contact
Shopify Support
, or mail us at one of the addresses below. If you would like to submit a legally binding request to demand someone else’s personal information (for example, if you have a subpoena or court order), please review our
Guidelines for Legal Requests
.
If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, website visitor or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with and you are located in the EEA or UK, Shopify International Ltd is the controller of your personal data. If you buy something from or otherwise provide your information to a Shopify-powered store, the merchant is your data controller and we are acting as a processor on their behalf.
If you have questions about how a merchant or store processes your personal information, you should contact the merchant or visit their privacy policy.

We collect account and payment information you provide to us (including information about your business if you are a merchant), Shopify stores or items you save to favorites, purchases you make, reviews you post, and how you otherwise interact or communicate with stores or other users on our apps or services. We also collect information about how you browse through our apps and sites, including search terms you may enter.
Your device(s): We collect information from and about the devices you use, including computers, phones, and other web-connected devices you use to access our apps or services, and we combine this information across different devices you use.
Third parties: We receive information from partners who help us provide you with our services including the following:
Email providers. If you use the Shop App and you connect your third party inboxes, such as Gmail or Outlook (according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law), we receive information to identify shopping-related emails and display within Shop information about specific orders you have made, stores you have engaged with in the past, and other related information.
Service Providers. We receive information from our service providers, who help us provide services to our merchants, like reviewing accounts for fraud or other concerns.
Marketplaces. If you use the Shop App, we receive information about purchases you have made from other marketplaces or platforms, such as Amazon, that you choose to connect through Shop. This information helps us to provide and improve Shop, to personalize your experience using our apps and services, and to determine if you are eligible for specific offers or payment methods.
Subprocessors. We work with third party subprocessors for cloud hosting, content delivery, data analysis, internal logging, fulfillment services and email transmission, among others, to provide you with our services. For more information, see Shopify’s subprocessors.
Analytics and cookie providers. We receive information through our use of cookies, social plugins (such as the Facebook “like” button), pixels and tags for business purposes, such as providing information to help measure how users interact with our website content. For more information about how we use these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.
How long we keep your information
Because we need your personal information to provide Shopify services, we generally keep your personal information, including sensitive personal information, while you use Shopify products or services or until you tell us to delete your information. We may also keep personal information to comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests.
If you are a merchant operating a Shopify-powered store, and you close the store, stop paying your subscription fees, or we terminate your account, we retain store information for two years before we begin the deletion process.
When you visit or make a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, we act as a service provider or processor for the merchant, and the merchant, not Shopify, decides how long your information is retained.
Your rights over your information
Depending on where you live, how you use Shopify, and subject to certain exceptions, you may have some or all of the following rights:
Right to Know: The right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we collect, use, or disclose about you, and information about our data practices.
Right to Request Correction: The right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.
Right to Request Deletion: The right to request that we delete personal information that we have collected about you.
To exercise your rights, including the “right to know” and “right to delete,” please submit a request through our online portal. If you use Shop or Shop Pay, please visit
https://shop.app/delete-account
for instructions on how to request deletion of your information.
If you have visited or made a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, please contact the specific merchant directly. If you make a request to us, we will forward your request to the relevant merchant.
Please note that to protect your information and the integrity of our products and services, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In some cases we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as your email address or a government issued ID.
Under US Privacy Laws, you may also designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may need to collect additional information, such as a government issued ID, to verify your identity before processing your request to protect your information.
For information on the CCPA requests we have received, please see here. In certain states, you may have the right to appeal our decision regarding a request related to these rights. If you wish to appeal a decision, please contact Shopify Support.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.

Gift Cards
You may from time to time have the ability to purchase, receive, send, receive and/or activate through us digital gift cards (each, a “Gift Card”).
We will send each Gift Card to the recipient for which the purchaser thereof has provided us with the recipient information that we require. The recipient may be the purchaser themselves or a third party. Gift Cards are redeemable only through the merchant that is selected by the Gift Card purchaser in the purchase process (the “Merchant”), and the Gift Card balance is available only through that Merchant. The Gift Card balance is not available through us. We will provide each recipient of a Gift Card with an activation code to activate the Gift Card through us, so that it may then be redeemed with the Merchant. That activation code does not expire or have fees. The Merchant’s terms and conditions also apply to both activation and redemption. We reserve the right to discontinue our gift cards product line or the gift cards of any individual Merchant(s), including, without limitation, before a recipient has either activated with us or redeemed with the Merchant an already-purchased Gift Card. If a Gift Card is discontinued after purchase by the Gift Card purchaser but before activation with us by the Gift Card recipient, we will replace the Gift Card with our choice of replacement Gift Card(s) from our choice of third party(ies), at equivalent value. We may provide the Gift Card purchaser information about their Gift Card recipient’s Gift Card activation status.
Until such time as we deposit a Gift Card with a carrier (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or Royal Mail) for delivery to the Gift Card recipient, the risk of loss of, and title to, that Gift Card belongs to us. The risk of loss of, and title to, that Gift Card then passes to the Gift Card recipient when we deposit it with a carrier for delivery to such recipient. The Gift Card recipient is responsible for safeguarding the Gift Card from unauthorized use. We are not responsible if any delivered Gift Card is lost, stolen, or destroyed, or if a Gift Card is used without permission. There are a variety of scams that request payment by gift card. We are not responsible, and assume no liability to you, for any unlawful conduct or fraud by any third party associated with any Gift Card.
By using a Gift Card, you agree to comply with these Terms and to not use a Gift Card in any manner that is misleading, deceptive, unfair, or otherwise harmful to us, our affiliates, or our customers. We reserve the right, without notice to you, to void a Gift Card without a refund, suspend or terminate customer accounts, suspend or terminate the ability to use our application(s) and/or website(s), cancel or limit orders, and bill alternative forms of payment if we suspect that a Gift Card is obtained, used or applied  fraudulently, unlawfully, or otherwise in violation of these Terms.

In addition, from time to time the Services may include links to third-party sites, services and/or products that we think may be of interest to you. To take advantage of these features, we may ask you to register for, or log into, the services of their respective providers. By enabling third-party services within the Services, you are allowing and authorizing us (a) to pass your log-in information to these service providers for this purpose and (b) to receive information and content from such third-party services.

You will pay us all fees and charges incurred in accordance with the authorized form of payment and these Terms. If you dispute any fees or charges, you will let us know within sixty (60) days after the date that we invoice or otherwise charge you, and give us the opportunity to remediate any problem which you believe entitles you to dispute those fees or charges. You hereby grant to us the right to fix any payment processing errors that we may discover, and the right to correct any such processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the transaction found to be in error.
If you have chosen to receive Products and/or Services on a subscription basis: (1) you hereby grant us the right to bill payments as specified in the Products/Services description and/or ordering process; and (2) if your payment and customer information does not remain true, accurate and current for the length of your subscription(s) and you do not notify us promptly when such information changes, we may suspend or terminate your subscription(s); and (3) you hereby acknowledge and agree that we may participate in programs supported by your card provider (e.g., expiration-date updater services) to attempt to update your payment information, and you authorize us to continue billing your account with the updated information that we obtain.
Shipping
The risk of loss of, and title to, Products passes to you or your designated shipping recipient when we deposit such Product(s) with a carrier for delivery to you or such recipient.
Returns & Refunds
We want you to be 100% satisfied with your experience with the Services and the Products. If within the first thirty (30) days you are not completely satisfied with your order, we will either (a) provide a replacement in the case of a defect or (b) in all other cases, issue a complete refund, subject to the exceptions and restrictions listed below:
Refunds are limited to amounts actually paid by you. This does not include the promotional value of any special offer or discount.
In cases where the return/refund is due to your order arriving damaged or with a defect confirmed by us, we will in our sole discretion either (a) provide you with a prepaid return shipping label, (b) reimburse your cost of return shipping, or (c) direct you to discard the damaged or defective product. For all other cases, return shipping costs are your responsibility. Shipping and handling charges may apply to Services and Products that are otherwise offered on a free or promotional basis.
All orders receiving bulk/wholesale pricing are final, and no refund will be given except in the case of material damage or defect upon your order’s arrival. If the damage or defect cannot be verified over the phone or via email contact, you may need to return the item to us for inspection before a determination can be made as to a potential refund. Please be sure to request and carefully review digital proofs when placing a bulk/wholesale order.
In addition to the above satisfaction guarantee, we also offer a limited lifetime warranty against defective workmanship on all our canvas wall décor Products, if such defective workmanship causes a canvas wall décor Product to be unusable for its intended purpose in a way that did not exist in the first thirty (30) days after you received it. To make such a warranty claim, please contact us, either via our website, via the self-service tools that may be provided in the app tray or drawer if using one of our mobile applications, or by telephone if you are using one of the Services that provides for telephone support.

Dispute Resolution (Class Action Waiver, Jury Trial Waiver and Arbitration Agreement)
PLEASE READ THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS RIGHTS YOU MAY OTHERWISE HAVE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION, IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
For purposes of this Dispute Resolution section only, “we” or “us” refers to us and our present and future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, shareholders, members, directors, managers, employees, attorneys, representatives and agents. 
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) the procedures and other terms set forth in this Dispute Resolution section apply to any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services, your purchase and/or use of the Product(s,) and/or your relationship with us, howsoever alleged, including, without limitation,  in contract, tort, product liability, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or other legal theory (each, a “Dispute”), (b) you and we intend that “Disputes” be read as broadly as possible, and include, without limitation, any dispute or claim that [1]arose before the existence of these Terms or a prior iteration hereof (including, without limitation, disputes or claims pertaining to advertising, [2]is currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class, and [3]may arise after termination of these Terms,(c) you and we intend that “Disputes” not include any dispute or claim involving intellectual property rights, (d) these Terms and this Dispute Resolution section do not prevent you or us from bringing a Dispute to the attention of any government agency, (e) these Terms and this Dispute Resolution section do not prevent you or us from taking a Dispute to small claims court so long as it is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction, and (f) whether a Dispute falls within the jurisdictional limits of small claims court will be for the small claims court to decide in the first instance.
Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process
You and we will work together in an effort to informally resolve any Dispute. As between us, the party initiating a Dispute will send the other a personally signed, written notice of the Dispute that includes, without limitation, (a) information sufficient to identify any transaction and account at issue, (b) the initiating party’s name, address, telephone number, and email address and (c) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute and the relief sought, including, without limitation, a calculation for any damages or other monetary relief sought. If you have the Dispute with us, you will send such notice to PlanetArt, LLC, 23801 Calabasas Road, Suite 2005, Calabasas, California 91302, Attn.: General Counsel. If we have the Dispute with you, we may send such notice to the most recent contact information we have for you.
For a period of sixty (60) days from receipt of a completed notice (which can be extended by agreement between you and us), you and we will each negotiate in good faith in an effort to informally resolve the Dispute. As between us, the party receiving the notice may request a telephone conference to aid in the resolution of the Dispute. If such a conference is requested, you will personally participate in the conference (with your counsel, if represented), and (b) you and we will schedule such conference for a mutually convenient time, which may be outside of the 60-day period.
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) completion of the process set forth in the preceding two paragraphs (the "Process") will be a condition precedent to initiating a claim in arbitration or court, (b) if the sufficiency of a notice of and/or compliance with the Process is at issue, such issue may be raised with and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction at either your or our election, and any court case or arbitration will be stayed during the pendency of such action, (c) the court determining compliance with the Process in any such action will have the authority to enforce the condition precedent to further litigation of the Dispute in court or arbitration, including, without limitation, the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations, (d)nothing in this Dispute Resolution section limits either your or our right to seek relief in court or arbitration for non-compliance with the Process, (e) all applicable limitations periods (including, without limitation, statutes of limitations) will be tolled from the date of receipt of a completed notice through the conclusion of the Process, and (f) you or we may commence litigation or arbitration if a Dispute is not resolved through this Process.
Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (a) EACH OF US MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general or representative proceeding, (b) you and we will not be a member of any putative or actual class in a class action brought by any third party, nor will either of us seek to become a class representative in an action against the other, (c) disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, or validity of this Class Action Waiver (as defined below) may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator, and (d) nothing in this paragraph limits either your or our right to participate in a class-wide settlement.
WHERE PERMISSIBLE, YOU AND WE WILL BRING DISPUTES IN COURT RATHER THAN ARBITRATION, AND ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH (THE “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”).
YOU AND WE EACH HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
Arbitration Agreement
IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER FROM APPLYING TO DISPUTES BROUGHT IN COURT, YOU AND WE WILL RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, SUBJECT TO THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER, RATHER THAN IN COURT. You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that, in any such arbitration, (a) the arbitrator will decide all issues except issues that (which will be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide) [1] are reserved in these Terms for a court, [2] pertain to the scope, validity, and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution section or [3] pertain to the arbitrability of a Dispute, (b) these Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and you and we intend that they be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and (c) if any court or arbitrator determines that the Class Action Waiver is void or unenforceable, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis for any reason, then the arbitration agreement set forth in this Dispute Resolution section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and you and we will each be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate the Dispute.
Arbitration Procedures
You hereby acknowledge and agree that, in individual arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there may be less or different discovery and/or potential for appellate review than in court.  You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that the National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) will administer the arbitration of any Dispute in accordance with the then-applicable NAM rules (including, without limitation, the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (the “NAM Rules”), as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. The NAM Rules are available online at
https://namadr.com
, by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550, and/or by written request to us at our address set forth in these Terms. If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Dispute Resolution section, you and we will agree on an administrator that will do so, provided that if you and we do not agree then you and we will jointly petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will do so.
As between us, the party initiating an arbitration will send the other a personally signed, written notice of the arbitration that includes, without limitation, (a) a certification under penalty of perjury of compliance with the Process, and (b) a representation that such party will comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) the arbitration will be before a single, neutral arbitrator, (b) you will have the right to choose to have the arbitration conducted by way of a phone, video, or written submissions, except for the arbitration of a Dispute seeking $25,000 or more and/or injunctive relief, which will have an in-person or video hearing unless you and we agree otherwise, each in our sole and absolute discretion, (c) you and we each reserve the right to request a hearing on any matter from the arbitrator, and (d) you and our company representative will each personally appear at any hearing (with your and our counsel, if represented).
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that the arbitrator will (a) be authorized to [1] impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 on represented parties and/or their counsel, [2] re-allocate their compensation, expenses and/or administrative fees, as well as your and our legal fees and costs related to the arbitration, if they determine that a claim, defense and/or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous (and the arbitrator will apply the cost-shifting provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 after entry of an award), and [3] award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including, without limitation, injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the single party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim, and (b) issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain essential findings and conclusions.
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that the arbitrator will not be authorized to (a) consolidate more than one person’s claims, and (b) preside over any form of class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of the prohibitions in this Dispute Resolution section on non-individualized injunctive or declaratory relief and class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceedings are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that such a claim or request for relief will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.
You and we hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, except a satisfied award may not be entered, and (b) no award will have preclusive effect in any other arbitration or proceeding in which you are not a named party.
Cost of Arbitration
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the NAM Rules and fee schedule, (b) you and we have a shared interest in reducing the costs and increasing the efficiencies associated with arbitration and (c) you and we (and your and our counsel, if represented) will work together in good faith towards making any arbitration cost-effective for both you and us.
Settlement
In any arbitration, the defending party may make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to such motion being granted. In such case, neither you nor we will disclose any settlement offer(s) to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the Dispute. If the award is issued in the defending party’s favor, or the award is issued in the prosecuting party’s favor but is less than the defending party’s settlement offer, then prosecuting party will pay the defending party’s attorneys’ fees and costs incurred after such offer was made. If any applicable law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then any settlement offer made pursuant to this provision will serve to cease the accumulation of any attorneys’ fees and/or costs to which the prosecuting party may be entitled for the cause of action under which they are claiming.
Additional Procedures for Mass Filings
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that these Additional Procedures for Mass Filings (in addition to the other provisions of this Dispute Resolution section) will apply if you participate in a filing and/or prosecution of 25 or more similar Disputes (including, without limitation, yours) by the same or coordinated counsel (a “Mass Filing”). In the event of a Mass Filing (a) you hereby acknowledge and agree that [1] resolution of your Dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court and not in arbitration and [2] any applicable limitations periods (including, without limitation, statutes of limitations) will be tolled for your Dispute from the time that your Dispute is first submitted to NAM until your Dispute is selected to proceed as part of a staged process (as set forth below) or is settled, withdrawn, opted out of arbitration or otherwise resolved pursuant to this Dispute Resolution section, and (b) your and our counsel will meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the Disputes at issue, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of Disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties’ and NAM’s resource, in the Mass Filing.
STAGE ONE: If at least 50 Disputes are submitted as part of the Mass Filing, (a) counsel for the claimants and our counsel will each select 25 Disputes to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process, (b) you and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that [1] each of those 50 Disputes will be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually, [2] if one of those 50 Disputes is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, you will have the right to select another Dispute to proceed in its place as part of Stage One, [3] if a second of those 50 Disputes is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, we will have the right to select another Dispute to proceed in its place as part of Stage One, and [4] if a third or greater number of those 50 Disputes is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, you and we will alternatingly have the right to select another Dispute to proceed in each’s withdrawn Dispute’s place as part of Stage One, and (c) you and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that the remaining Disputes will not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection therewith. After the Stage One set of proceedings concludes with awards in each, counsel for the claimants and our counsel will in good faith participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by you and us, and paid by us, in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stage One).
STAGE TWO: If the remaining Disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, (a) counsel for the claimants and our counsel will each select 50 Disputes per side to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process (and if there are fewer than 100 Disputes, all will proceed individually in Stage Two), (b) you and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that [1] five (5) of those 50 Disputes will be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually, [2] if one or more of those 50 Disputes is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, you and we will each have the right to select another Dispute to proceed in its place as part of Stage Two in the same process as set forth for Stage One, and (c) you and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that any remaining Disputes will not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection therewith. After the Stage Two set of proceedings concludes with awards in each, counsel for the claimants and our counsel will in good faith participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by you and us, and paid by us, in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stage One and Stage Two).
Upon completion of the mediation set forth in Stage Two, each remaining Dispute (if any) that is neither settled nor withdrawn will be opted out of arbitration and proceed only as a sole proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of these Terms.
You and we each hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) if, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court of competent jurisdiction decides that this Additional Procedures for Mass Filings section of this Dispute Resolution section apply to your Dispute but are not enforceable, then your Dispute will not proceed in arbitration and will only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms, and (b) that this Additional Procedures for Mass Filings section of this Dispute Resolution section and each of its requirements are essential parts of these Terms.
Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement
If we make any future changes to this Dispute Resolution section other than a change to our contact information, you will have the right to reject any such change by sending us, within thirty (30) days of such change, a personally signed, written notice to PlanetArt, LLC, 23801 Calabasas Road, Suite 2005, Calabasas, California 91302, Attn.: General Counsel. You hereby acknowledge and agree that such written notice will not constitute an opt out of arbitration altogether, but rather, only of any change(s) made to this Dispute Resolution section in the thirty (30) days prior to your written notice.
Miscellaneous
YOU AND WE EACH HEREBY AGREE THAT WE INTEND EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS TO BE ENFORCEABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT (AND ONLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT) PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time, effective immediately upon posting here. Any updates, new services or modifications of existing services will be governed by these Terms.

We reserve the right to modify, discontinue or suspend, temporarily or permanently, any of the Services (or any part thereof) and/or the Products, with or without notice.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us governing your use of the Services and the Products. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms or any other terms or conditions available elsewhere regarding the Services and/or the Products, these Terms will govern and be given precedence.
The waiver of any right under these Terms will not operate as past, present or future waiver of that right or of any other right. No waiver will be effective in any case unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.
In addition to such other provisions that, by their terms, survive any termination of these Terms, the following sections will survive termination of these Terms: (a) limitations of liability provisions; (b) disclaimer of warranties; (c) indemnification; and (d) dispute resolution (including, without limitation, arbitration agreement, class action waiver and jury trial waiver).
Except as otherwise provided herein, if any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, a modified provision will be substituted that carries out as nearly as possible your and our original intent as evidenced solely by the language of these Terms, and the validity, legality and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or the use of the Services. We have the right to assign any or all our rights and obligations under these Terms at any time; however, all rights that you may have under these Terms or otherwise in and to the Services may not be assigned by you.
