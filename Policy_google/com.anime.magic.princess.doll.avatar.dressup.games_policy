YOYO Limited Games Privacy Policy
Last Updated: September 7, 2024
This Privacy Policy explains who we are and as a data controller, how we handle your personal information (i.e.,
        collect, record, organize, structure, store, adapt or alter, retrieve, consult, use, disclose, transfer,
        disseminate, or otherwise make available, align, or combine, restrict, delete, or destroy), and how you can
        exercise your privacy rights. We are YOYO Games Limited, a developer and publisher of games and mobile gaming
        applications available through app stores, including the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This Privacy
        Policy applies to personal information we collect through our games, mobile applications, and other products
        ("games") collectively referred to as “services.” By using our services, you agree to be bound by this Privacy
        Policy and consent to our handling of your information as described herein.
1. Information We Collect From You
We collect most of the information about you directly from your interactions with our games or from third-party
        ads within our games or advertisements we place in other publishers' games. Generally, the information we
        collect about you relates to the type of device you're using, helping us identify your device and how you play
        our games, and may include information you voluntarily submit to contact us. We may also collect information
        from app store platforms, partners, and other third parties, such as your interests and in-app purchases
        (although we never receive your payment or credit card information).
The information we collect through the services generally falls into the following categories:
(a) Information You Provide Voluntarily
Certain parts of our services may require you to voluntarily provide personal information. For example, we may
        ask you for certain details to process an inquiry, such as:
•	Your name, email address, or other contact information necessary to address your inquiry;
•	Any information you submit to our support team via email.
We will try to explain why we need your personal information at the time we request it.
(b) Information We Collect Automatically
When you use our services, we may automatically collect certain information about you and/or your device in
        accordance with applicable data protection laws, such as:
• Information about how you use our services (e.g., in-game progress, levels completed, game session duration,
        settings preferences, in-game ads viewed, or game preferences).
• Your IP address and device identifiers (e.g., your advertising ID or device ID; for more information, see our
        section on advertising IDs and device IDs).
•	The type of device and operating system you are using.
•	Broad geographic location (e.g., country or city-level location based on your IP address).
•	Precise geographic location based on your IP address.
• Requesting your Write External Storage permissions (for example, we may collect documents, photos, and other
        information necessary for related functions to facilitate your normal use of the product features. However, our
        product will not currently collect and use other music files, audio files, videos, voice recordings, or other
        similar information).
Advertising IDs
refer to the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) on Apple and the Google
        Advertising ID (GAID) on Google devices. These are unique identifiers used by advertisers for personalized ads
        on mobile devices. They are present across all mobile apps, allowing for cross-app tracking. On Apple devices,
        you can opt out by selecting the "Limit Ad Tracking" option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can
        opt out by selecting the "Opt out of personalized ads" option. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal
        identifiers uniquely associated with your device.
Device Identifiers/Information
refer to the device type, device model, device manufacturer,
        device operating system, and its language or other technical data (e.g., screen size or processor), or a
        combination of such data obtained by developers from the device, used to check compatibility with specific
        applications.
Some of this information may be collected via cookies, as described in the "Cookies" section.
When a program crashes, the system automatically generates a crash log. We may collect these logs and use
        specialized tools to analyze them to identify the cause of the crash.
When diagnosing program or system issues, we collect relevant diagnostic data, including system status,
        application information, and application device performance. This data will be used to analyze the root cause of
        the problem and develop appropriate solutions.
(c) Information From Third-Party Sources
We may receive information about you from third-party social networks (e.g., Google Play Games, Apple Game
        Center, Facebook) and other partners or third parties.
Third-Party Social Networks:
You may choose to connect to our services via your social media
        account. The information we receive from your social media will depend on your privacy settings, but it
        generally includes your basic public profile information, such as your username, gender, and friends who are
        playing the same game. (See "Third-Party Social Networks" below for more details.)
Third-Party Service Providers:
We may receive your personal information from third-party
        sources. For example, we may obtain your personal information when you install our game and prior to
        installation, if you clicked on an advertisement for the same game.
Advertising Partners:
From time to time, we may also receive personal information from other
        third-party sources. For example, if you click on an advertisement that directs you to our services (such as an
        ad for one of our games shown in another publisher’s game), we will receive information about the ad network and
        the campaign from which the install originated (see "Advertising" below for more details).
(d) No Special Categories of Information
We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information,” such as personal data revealing
        racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership, genetic data,
        biometric data used to uniquely identify a person, data concerning health, or data concerning a person’s sex
        life or sexual orientation. Please exercise caution when sharing information about yourself (or others) on our
        forums.
2. How We Use Your Information

        subject to their respective terms. Please review the privacy policies and terms of service for Apple, Google,
        and Amazon.com stores.
3. How We Share Your Information
We cannot provide all the services necessary for the successful operation of our games by ourselves. Therefore,
        we must share the collected information with third parties to develop and provide our services, display
        advertisements, conduct analysis and research, and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns with
        our partners. We also reserve the right to disclose your information (including personal identification
        information) in the following circumstances: when required by law, in an anonymized manner, and in aggregate
        form that cannot be used to identify you.
We may share such information for the following purposes:
•
Our Analytics Providers:
We use third-party analytics, such as TapJoy, Unity, and Firebase,
        to provide our services and for analysis and research purposes. The data we share with these providers is
        encoded. The providers can assign a random ID, and they cannot match it back to you. We can aggregate data for
        benchmarking purposes.
•
Our Cloud Service Providers:
We store the information we collect from you with our
        third-party cloud service providers, such as iCloud and Google Cloud Platform.
•
Our Tracking and Fraud Prevention Vendors:
For some of our games, we use tracking and
        anti-fraud vendors, such as AppsFlyer and Tenjin, to measure performance and optimize our advertising campaigns,
        display ads, analyze to improve our services, and prevent fraud. These providers may use APIs and SDKs in our
        games to collect and analyze user and device-related data, including impressions, clicks, installs, or other
        performance metrics of advertising campaigns and in-app events post-installation.
•
Third-Party Advertising Partners:
We have contracts with certain third-party advertising
        networks to help us serve ads to you, enabling us to continue offering games for free or at a low cost.
•
Third-Party Tracking Vendors for Advertising Partners:
We allow our advertising partners to
        track impressions, clicks, installs, or other performance metrics of their advertising campaigns to measure
        their effectiveness. They may use their own third-party tracking vendors.
•
Other Third-Party Service Providers:
For our games, we use Unity software to develop such
        games. For information on Unity's data processing, please refer to Unity's privacy policy at
Unity Privacy Policy
.
        For certain games, we collaborate with third-party development studios. These third-party studios do not have
        access to your personal information; they only have access to aggregated data that cannot be traced back to you.
We may enter into contracts with other partners or change existing partners in the future to provide any
        services related to the games. These changes will be updated from time to time or promptly when there are
        significant changes in data processing practices.
We reserve the right to disclose your information (including personal identification information) in response to
        legal requests, legal processes, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or
        outside your country of residence. We may also disclose your information if we determine that it is necessary or
        appropriate for national security, law enforcement, or other public interest matters. Additionally, we may
        disclose your information if we determine that disclosure is necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to
        protect our operations, users, or user experience. Furthermore, in the event of a restructuring, merger, or
        sale, we may transfer any of our information (including personal identification information) collected to the
        relevant third parties.

4. Advertising
(a) General Information
We use advertisements to fund our services and provide our games for free.
We offer our games
        for free or at a low cost, and to achieve this, we need to share the information we collect from you with our
        third-party advertising partners. To protect your privacy, we only temporarily store personal information. The
        information we collect helps us improve our website and games while keeping our games free for a broad range of
        players.

If you are a user in the European Economic Area (EEA), please note:
When you use our games, we show ads to you based on our legitimate interests. The legal basis for displaying
        advertisements to EEA users is compliant with the legitimate interests outlined in Article 6(1)(f) of the
        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we work closely with our data protection officer. Additionally,
        we ensure that data processing agreements with external advertising technology providers comply with Article 28
        of the GDPR. We also ensure that our external service providers are committed to a high level of data protection
        through strict protection agreements.
Before sharing any information with our advertising partners for personalized advertising, we always seek your
        consent when you accept via the relevant button while loading the game. We allow our advertising partners to
        share your personal information for personalized advertising purposes only if you consent in the relevant pop-up
        window. Our advertising partners use different technologies to achieve personalized advertising, so please
        review their data processing practices before you accept personalized advertising when loading the game. The
        legal basis for showing personalized ads to users based in the EEA is based on Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.
        Additionally, we ensure compliance with Article 28 of the GDPR with our external advertising technology
        providers. We are committed to a high level of data protection for our external service providers. The goal is
        to improve our games and provide players with more relevant advertisements. You can choose to withdraw your
        consent to share your personal information for personalized advertising at any time. You can do this by going to
        the game settings and clicking the Terms & Privacy button in the section for withdrawing personalized
        advertising consent within the privacy policy. You can manage your preferences regarding the types of ads you
        wish to receive. When you decide to withdraw consent, or if you do not provide consent, you may still see the
        same number of ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they will not be based
        on your preferences, interests, behaviors, demographics, etc. Our advertising partners may continue to display
        ads based on the content of the applications you are using.
(b) In-Game Advertising (i.e., when you view ads within our games)
To enable us to display in-game ads, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with advertisers to help
        them find suitable ads to display to you in our games and third-party platforms. You can manage this in your
        device settings. We cannot control which specific ads are displayed in our games (this is controlled by the
        advertising platforms), but we do limit certain categories of ads.
Advertising platforms use Advertising IDs for various purposes (see the privacy statements of our advertising
        partners listed), including:
•	Limiting the number of times you see the same ad;
•	Ensuring they interact with real users on devices, rather than “automated” bots;
• Providing ads that are relevant to you (based on your Advertising ID and interactions with other brands), and
        recording ads based on your Advertising ID and general geographical location. Other brands purchase advertising
        space in our games through advertising platforms or ad exchanges. Advertising networks or ad exchanges act as
        intermediaries between other gaming companies and us. They track clicks on ads and potential installs of
        applications from other developers. The number of views, clicks, and installs of ads is measured using the
        advertising ID.
• Tracking similar games that you use for marketing purposes. Advertisers typically use IP addresses to
        understand your approximate geographical region (country, state, and sometimes at the city level).
(c) Viewing Our Ads on Third-Party Services
We also advertise our games through advertising networks in other applications to reach audiences interested in
        them (identified using Advertising IDs).
Advertising platforms use Advertising IDs for various purposes (see the privacy statements of our advertising
        partners listed), including:
• Measuring ad effectiveness (viewing the aggregate impressions, clicks, and installs generated through ads in
        other publishers' games);
• Informing players who have not played the game for some time about new content in the game. This is done
        through the advertising platform’s advertising ID. Then, the ad network displays ads about new content to these
        users;
• Not displaying ads in games where players are already playing. We can manage this through the ad network's
        advertising ID. The ad network will then prevent these players from seeing ads;
•	Promoting games to a group of potential players.
(d) Who Can Show You Personalized Ads?
Please refer to the list of advertising providers below that allow personalized advertising and review their
        data processing practices, including the technologies they use for personalized purposes.
(e) How to Opt Out of Personalized Advertising?
In addition to specific tools available for users in the EEA, you can use your device settings.
iOS
Open the "Settings" app on iOS, then select the "Privacy" menu item, and choose the "Advertising" sub-item. If
        you enable the "Limit Ad Tracking" option, we can only take limited measures, such as identifying unique users
        or combating fraud. In the same menu, you can always delete your IDFA (by selecting “Reset Ad-ID”), creating a
        new unmerged ID that will not use previously collected data.
Android
Open the "Settings" app and select the "Google" menu item. Depending on your device, this option may not be
        visible in the main menu, but you can find it using the search function at the top of the personal settings
        menu. From there, select the "Ads" sub-item and activate the option "Opt out of personalized ads" to prevent the
        creation of profiles and the display of personalized ads. You can also use the same menu (by selecting "Reset
        Advertising ID"), creating a new ID that will not merge with previously collected data.
5. Third-Party Social Networks
(a) Connecting to Third-Party Social Networks
Some of our games use third-party services, such as Google Play Games Services, Apple Game Center, and Facebook
        (referred to as "Third-Party Social Networks"). These games allow you to log in to your third-party social
        network accounts using the "Login" feature in our application. You can also share content created within the
        application on these third-party social networks. Please note that third-party social networks are governed by
        their own privacy policies, terms, and end-user agreements, for which we are not responsible and cannot control
        the sharing practices or policies of the parties operating those sites. For any other questions, please contact
        us at
yoyogames.studio@gmail.com
.
(b) Information We May Receive When You Connect to Third-Party Social Networks
The information you allow us to access varies by application and is subject to the privacy settings you have
        established on these third-party social networks. You can control and learn more about these settings from the
        respective third-party social networks. When you use the "Login" feature, we may access and store some or all of
        the following information, as permitted by you, the third-party social network, and your preferences: (i) basic
        information from your public profile, such as your nickname and profile picture; (ii) login ID and/or player
        identifier string; (iii) your friend list; (iv) notifications displayed during the "Login" process. We may share
        your name and game data (such as steps, game progress, and scores) with applicable applications, friends who
        also use the "Login" feature, or with contacts related to the "Connect to" feature within the applicable
        third-party social media network accounts.
The application may further request your permission to disclose information on your behalf to these third-party
        social networks (such as status updates). Please remember that we will only do this with your explicit consent
        and will store your ID and full name for user identification purposes. Other information will only be stored
        within the application on your device to allow the application to communicate directly with the third-party
        social networks.
(c) How You Share Your Information with Third-Party Social Networks
If you engage in game-related activities (such as leaderboards and multiplayer games) using third-party social
        networks, you share your information (for example, scores, rankings, and achievements) with other players and
        the third-party social networks.

Google 为什么要收集数据
我们会利用数据打造更好的服务
我们会将从所有 Google 服务中收集的信息用于以下用途：
提供 Google 服务
我们会利用您的信息来
提供 Google 服务
，例如处理您搜索的字词以便返回相关结果，或根据您的通讯录建议收件人以协助您分享内容。
维护和改进 Google 服务
我们还会利用您的信息来
确保 Google 服务正常运行
，例如跟踪中断情况或排查您向我们报告的问题。此外，我们还会利用您的信息来
改进
Google 服务，例如，了解哪些搜索字词最常拼错有助于我们改进所有 Google 服务中使用的拼写检查功能。
开发新服务
我们会利用在现有服务中收集的信息来协助开发新服务。例如，通过了解用户在 Picasa（Google 的首款照片应用）中组织整理照片的方式，我们设计并推出了 Google 照片。
提供个性化服务，包括内容和广告
我们会利用收集的信息为您定制 Google 服务，包括推荐内容，以及提供个性化内容和
定制的搜索结果
。例如，
安全检查
功能会根据您使用 Google 产品的情况向您提供安全提示。此外，Google Play 可以根据您已安装的应用、您在 YouTube 上观看过的视频等信息来推荐您可能会喜欢的新应用，具体取决于您的设置。
我们可能还会根据您的兴趣以及您在各项 Google 服务中的活动，向您展示
个性化广告
，具体取决于您的设置。例如，如果您搜索“山地自行车”，可能会在 YouTube 上看到运动装备广告。您可前往
我的广告中心
内的广告设置中控制 Google 可以利用哪些信息向您展示广告。
我们不会根据
敏感类别
（例如种族、宗教、性取向或健康状况）向您展示个性化广告。
我们不会根据您在 Google 云端硬盘、Gmail 和 Google 相册中的内容向您展示个性化广告。
我们不会与广告主分享可用于识别您个人身份的信息，例如您的姓名或电子邮件地址（除非您要求我们这样做）。例如，如果您看到附近花店的广告并选择“点按通话”按钮，我们会为您接通电话，并且可能会与花店分享您的电话号码。
前往“我的广告中心”
评估效果
我们会利用数据进行分析和评估，以便了解 Google 服务的使用情况。例如，我们会分析与您访问 Google 网站相关的数据，分析结果可用于优化产品设计之类的用途。我们还会利用您与之互动的广告的相关数据（包括您的相关 Google 搜索活动记录）来协助广告主了解其广告系列的效果。我们会利用 Google Analytics（分析）等多种工具来执行此操作。当您访问或运行使用 Google Analytics（分析）的网站或应用时，Google Analytics（分析）用户可能会将您在相应网站或应用中的活动信息与您在其他使用 Google 广告服务的网站或应用中的活动
关联
起来。
与您沟通
我们会利用收集的信息（例如您的电子邮件地址）直接与您互动。例如，如果我们检测到可疑活动（例如尝试从不同于平常的位置登录您的 Google 帐号），则可能会向您发送通知。或者，我们可能会让您了解 Google 服务即将发生的变化或即将进行的改进。此外，当您与 Google 联系时，我们会保存您的请求记录，以便解决您可能遇到的任何问题。
保护 Google、我们的用户和公众
我们会利用信息来协助提升 Google 服务的
安全性和可靠性
。这包括检测、防范和应对可能会危害 Google、我们的用户或
公众
的欺诈行为、滥用行为、安全风险和技术问题。
为了将您的信息用于上述用途，我们会利用不同的技术处理信息。例如：利用自动化系统分析您的内容，以便为您提供定制的搜索结果、个性化广告、根据您使用 Google 服务的情况量身定制的其他功能，等等；分析您的内容，以便
检测滥用行为
，例如垃圾邮件、恶意软件和非法内容；利用
算法
识别数据中的模式，比如 Google 翻译可以检测您请求翻译的短语的常用语言模式，从而协助用户使用各种语言进行沟通交流。
我们可能会
将在各项 Google 服务中以及您的所有设备中收集的信息用于
上述用途。例如，如果您在 YouTube 上观看吉他演奏者的视频，那么在您访问使用 Google 广告产品的网站时，可能会看到吉他课程广告，具体取决于您的设置。我们可能会将
您在其他网站和应用中的活动
与您的个人信息相关联，以改进 Google 服务和 Google 投放的广告，具体取决于您的账号设置。
如果有其他用户已知道您的电子邮件地址或其他能够识别您身份的信息，我们可能会向他们显示您的 Google 帐号公开信息，例如您的姓名和照片。这有很多好处，比如有助于用户识别来自您的电子邮件。
在将您的信息用于本隐私权政策未涵盖的用途时，我们会事先征求您的同意。

。
敏感的个人信息
这是一种特殊类别的个人信息，与医疗保密信息、种族或民族背景、政治/宗教信仰或性取向等主题有关。
设备
设备是指可用于访问 Google 服务的计算机。例如桌面设备、平板电脑、智能音响设备和智能手机都可视为设备。
使用浏览器进行网络存储
“使用浏览器进行网络存储”的机制可让网站将数据存储在设备上的浏览器中。如果在“本地存储”模式下使用该机制，则数据可存储在各个会话中。这样一来，即使在关闭并重新打开浏览器后，用户仍可以获取相应数据。有助于实现网络存储的技术之一就是 HTML 5。
算法
计算机在执行解题运算时遵循的流程或一系列规则。
唯一标识符
唯一标识符是一串字符，可用于唯一标识浏览器、应用或设备。不同的标识符在有效期、是否可由用户重置以及获取方式方面会有所不同。
唯一标识符具有多种用途，其中包括检测安全风险和欺诈行为、将服务（例如您的电子邮件收件箱）同步、记录您的偏好以及提供合乎个人需求的广告。例如，根据 Cookie 中存储的唯一标识符，网站可以在浏览器中以您的首选语言显示内容。您可以将浏览器配置为拒绝所有 Cookie 或在网站发送 Cookie 时显示提示。 详细了解
Google 如何使用 Cookie
。
在浏览器以外的其他平台上，唯一标识符可用于识别特定设备或其中的应用。例如，系统可以根据广告 ID 之类的唯一标识符在 Android 设备上提供具有相关性的广告（您可以在设备的设置部分
管理
此类标识符）。设备制造商还可以在设备中编入唯一标识符（有时称为通用唯一 ID 或 UUID），比如手机的 IMEI 号。举例来说，系统可以根据设备的唯一标识符针对设备定制 Google 服务，或分析与 Google 服务相关的设备问题。
像素标签
像素代码是在网站或电子邮件正文中应用的一种技术，用于跟踪特定活动（例如网站的浏览次数或电子邮件的打开时间）。像素代码经常与 Cookie 结合使用。
引荐来源网址
引荐来源网址（统一资源定位地址）是网络浏览器传送至目标网页的信息，通常是在您点击指向相应网页的链接后传送。引荐来源网址包含您在浏览器中最后一次访问的网页的网址。
应用数据缓存
应用数据缓存是指设备上的一种数据存储机制。使用它有很多好处，例如，可让网络应用在未连接互联网的情况下运行，以及可通过提高内容加载速度来改善相关应用的性能。
Cookie
Cookie 是在您访问网站时发送到您计算机上的一种小文件，其中包含一串字符。当您再次访问相应网站时，网站就可通过 Cookie 识别您的浏览器。Cookie 可能会存储用户偏好及其他信息。您可以将浏览器配置为拒绝所有 Cookie 或在网站发送 Cookie 时显示提示。不过，如果没有 Cookie，某些网站功能或服务可能无法正常工作。详细了解

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.
General Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer who downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services through advertisements served within a digital property, we may collect certain information, including the following:
Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;
Carrier;
Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);
Network connection type and speed;
IP Address;
Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services;
HTTP header information;
Advertising IDs (IDFA/GAID/Amazon FOSAID);
Vendor IDs (IDFV);
App Set IDs; and
Advertising and tracking preferences and restrictions.
Application publishers may choose to share with us additional information including your age or year of birth, gender, email, phone number, and interest segments for purposes of their own direct ad serving.  We do not retain this data or pass it downstream to advertising partners.  Please see the applicable publisher’s privacy policy for more information about their use of first party data.
Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here
, current as of the date listed at the top of that page.
If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, please see the
“Manage Your Privacy Choices”
section below. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or Switzerland, you may also see the
“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction.

If you are located in the European Union, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, the following additional provisions apply to you.
Data Privacy Framework
AppLovin complies with the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, AppLovin commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact AppLovin at
dataprotection@applovin.com
. AppLovin refers unresolved complaints to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request

Lawful Basis for Processing
On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide services to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning our products and services.
On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers, where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
If the processing of your personal data is necessary, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you if there is no other lawful basis for such processing. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of personal data should be sent to us as specified in the “Contact” section below.

This enables our partnering publishers and developers to provide content-rich services that are more relevant to their users, often using the advertising revenues they generate to offer their services for free or at a subsidised cost. Further, we may also obtain user data from our data partners, advertisers and/or advertisers’ partners for optimising digital advertising and/or analytical purposes including to provide relevant advertising and reporting.

1. WHO WE ARE
Vungle is an ad network providing a technology platform (“
Platform
”) for Clients that want to advertise and/or monetize their applications, games, and other products. Our “
Clients
” include “
Advertisers
” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Platform, and “
Publishers
” of applications that want to display relevant ads to end users (“
End Users
“) of third party applications (“
apps
“) that use our SDKs, APIs, hosted video advertising platform and/or any of our related advertising tools (collectively, the “
Vungle Ad Services
“).
Advertising revenue helps keep many games and apps free, and Vungle works hard to ensure that our ads are interesting, relevant, and safe for End Users.
2. VUNGLE AD SERVICES
This Section describes how Vungle collects and uses information we receive from End Users (“
you
“) of apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.
2.1 What information do we collect?
When you use an app supported by Vungle technology (see Section 2.3,
below
, our services can collect certain information about your mobile device. Some of this information (including for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be “personal information” or “personal data” as defined under law in some jurisdictions (including in California and the EU, respectively) (hereinafter, collectively referred to as “
personal information
”). We collect this information the first time Vungle’s SDK is initialized on a Publisher Client’s app. Note, however, that Vungle’s Ad Services do not collect any information that that enables us to identify End Users personally (such as your name, address, or email address).
LEARN MORE
The information we collect includes:
Information about your device
, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address, Vungle SDK version, information about the Publisher Client’s app currently active on your device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer or Publisher Client’s app).
Information about your behavior on our Publisher Client’s app
, such as information about the activities or actions on those apps, and session start/stop time. Historic versions of Vungle technology may also collect geolocation information (e.g., latitude and longitude co-ordinates), but only (i) if the Publisher Client’s app has enabled location services on your device and (ii) you have granted the Publisher permission to collect this information). However, versions that are current as of the date of this Notice no longer collect geolocation information.
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on
, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, the number of times you have seen the ad, the number of Vungle ads viewed per session, and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.
We may also combine and/or enhance the information we collect about your device, including the personal information, with information we may collect about your interactions with other ads served through Vungle’s Platform that you may view on other Publisher Client’s Apps, or with information collected from our Clients and third parties (such as data providers). This may include, for example, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on an app to help make the ads served to you more relevant while limiting your exposure to less relevant ads. We (or our third party partners) may also use this additional information to undertake “user matching,” which means that in addition to the ID an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Clients have assigned to an End User.
2.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information, including the personal information, we collect (sometimes in combination with information provided and sourced by independent validation partners) for a variety of business purposes, including the following:
Serving Ads:
To allow Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their apps, and Advertisers to bid on and display ads in that inventory.
Ad Reporting and Conversions:
: To allow Vungle to confirm with Advertisers information about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website and to ensure accurate billing for advertising services rendered.
Frequency Capping:
Preventing End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.
Customizing Ads:
To customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to you and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting your exposure to less relevant ads).
Performance Analytics and Optimization:
To analyze and optimize ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, implementing end user “whitelists” or “blacklists” (to ensure, in some cases, that certain ads are being viewed by appropriate audiences), as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Fraud Detection and Prevention:
Identifying invalid clicks, installs, or ad queries, and protecting us and our Clients from fraudulent behavior.
Providing and Improving the Vungle Ad Services:
Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to provide, protect, and improve the Vungle Ad Services and to ensure that our technologies function properly.
2.3
How does Vungle use its technology to collect information
?
We use our technology (in some jurisdictions, such as the EU, these may be referred to as “tracking technologies”) to collect information automatically from your device to perform many of the functions described in “
How do we use your information?
” above. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions for opting out in the apps, as described in “
Opt-Out Choices
” below.
LEARN MORE
The standard tracking technologies we use include:
Mobile “SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” (including our own SDKs):
These are blocks of code that are embedded into an app allowing Vungle to collect certain information (as described in “
2.1 What information do we collect?
” above relating to your use of apps using our technology. The embedded code from Vungle’s SDK allows the app to “speak” with Vungle’s Platform for purposes of delivering ads.
Mobile device identifiers:
We also use standard device identifiers, for example the IDFA advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices and the GAID advertising identifier used on Android devices, to monitor and improve the performance of the ads we show you.
Third-Party Ad Measurement URLs/Links:
Additionally, in providing the Vungle Ad Services to our Advertiser Clients, the Vungle ads may include URLs or links from the Advertiser Client’s chosen third-party measurement partner to collect information about your interaction with those ads. The information collected is used for ad delivery, reporting, and billing purposes and may also be used for performance optimization.
“Tags and Pixels”:
These are blocks of code that we and our Clients may use to monitor your interaction with apps using our technology. We may use these to synchronize information that we have collected with information independently collected by our Clients and other third party advertising platforms and advertisers that are interested in providing you with ads.
2.4 Your Opt-Out Choices.
You can opt out of having your information being used by Vungle for performance-based advertising by accessing your mobile device settings and following the most recent published instructions. If you limit ad tracking, you will still see advertisements (even ones sourced from Vungle’s network), but Vungle will no longer be able to use the personal information described above in
Section 2.1
to serve you with more relevant ads. In addition, the advertising identifier (along with any information collected about that identifier) that was previously assigned to you will also be disassociated. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt back in, we will not be able to use any of your past information for advertising purposes, and you will (for all practical purposes) be a new user to our system. For apps using older versions of the Vungle SDK, you may also stop the collection of location information by particular apps that may allow collection of location of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
2.5 How Do We Share Information?
Please see Section 4.1,
below
for information concerning how Vungle shares the information collected.
2.6 Privacy Practices of Vungle Clients.
Vungle is not responsible for the information practices of our Clients or their agents. We require our Clients to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide End Users with notice of the collection of data for advertising purposes as outlined in this Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of apps you visit for information about those apps’ data collection and use practices.
2.7 Minors and Children.
Our Clients are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply with data privacy protection legislation applicable to minors and children, such as the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
“), including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information. With respect to COPPA specifically, we rely upon our Publisher Clients to confirm whether or not their app is subject to COPPA. As required by COPPA, Vungle will enable a flag in our system when a Client indicates their app is subject to COPPA such that the End User’s device history is disassociated, and the only End User personal information used by the Vungle Ad Services would be persistent identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) to provide “support for internal operations” of the Vungle Ad Services (as permitted by COPPA).
3. VUNGLE WEBSITES
This Section describes how we collect and use Information in the usual course of business, including through our websites (such as

4.6 How do we keep your personal information secure?
We use appropriate administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process about you.

Specific measures we will use include hashing and pseudonymization of data prior to storage. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you should take care in deciding what information you send us in this way.

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such data or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If you are an End User, we typically store the personal information we collect about you, such as your IP address and other information described above, for 13 months from the date of last collection before we delete, overwrite, or anonymize that data, unless we are required to keep it to comply with a legal or audit obligation.

Also, Personal information can be obtained by Yandex through its partners (“Partners”), such as advertising partners or taxi service providers, who provide you with access to or let you use websites, programs, products or services owned or operated by them, and from the sources of publicly available personal data.

Privacy and security of your Personal information are extremely important to us. When you use the Sites and/or Services, Yandex processes your Personal information and ensures its protection in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
As part of our commitment to protecting your Personal information, we use this Policy to transparently inform you about the following:
(a) why and how your Personal information is collected and used (also, “processed”) by Yandex when you access the Sites or Services;
(b) Yandex’s role and responsibilities in this context as the legal entity deciding why and how your Personal information is processed;
(c) what instruments you may use to limit the amount of Personal information collected by Yandex; and
(d) what your rights are in relation to the above processing.
Personal information collected when you use the Sites and/or Services, or sites, services, programs or products of Partners, may differ depending on whether you access it while logged in to your Yandex user account or without logging in. When you are logged in to your Yandex user account as you are using the Sites or Services, Personal information collected by Yandex may be collated and combined with other Personal information (such as your identity, contact details, age and gender, if you shared this information with us) collected by Yandex in your user account. Yandex does not verify Personal information provided by you unless otherwise provided in the Terms of Use or License Agreement of relevant Services, and does not decide the its credibility or whether you have the legal capacity required. However, Yandex assumes that the information you provide is true, sufficiently complete and up-to-date.
Personal information collected by Yandex when you access, interact with or operate the Sites and/or Services includes:
(i) information provided by you when you register (create) a user account, such as your name, mobile phone number, address and age;
(ii) electronic data (http headers, IP address, cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, browser information, information about your hardware and software, wi-fi network data);
(iii) date and time of accessing the Sites or Services;
(iv) information related to your activity while using the Sites or Services (e.g. your search history, data on purchases in the Services, data on visited organizations, likes and preferences, email addresses of your mailing contacts, phonebook data, information about interaction with other users, as well as files and content stored in Yandex systems);
(v) (geo)location information;
(vi) other information about you that needs to be processed according to the terms and conditions of any specific Yandex Site or Service;
(vii) information about you that we may receive from our Partners in accordance with an agreement you made with this Partner and an agreement between Yandex and this Partner;
(viii) your payment cards information, and other payment information, provided by you, as well as provided by Partners or other entities engaged into processing of the payment operations conducted within the Yandex Sites or Services or in connection with providing commercial services by Yandex.
In addition, Yandex uses cookies and web beacons (including pixel tags) to collect your Personal information and associate this Personal information with your device and web browser (see Section 11 below).
Yandex does not actively collect any sensitive personal data (such as racial origins, political opinions, health or biometric data) unless specified in Terms of Use of relevant Services. However, you may voluntarily provide us with such data and we may process it as part of providing you with our Services (e.g. if you perform search queries related to your health). As we do not know in advance the potentially sensitive nature of the personal data you may provide to us, you must be aware that we may not be able to request your consent with such processing.
Yandex does not perform any form of profiling, which has the potential to significantly impact your rights and freedoms in accordance with applicable laws.
Yandex is not allowed to process your Personal information if it does not have a valid legal ground. Yandex will therefore only process your Personal information if:
(i) the processing is necessary to perform contractual obligations between you and Yandex such as User Agreement for Yandex Services (
https://yandex.com/legal/rules
) and the terms of use of specific Yandex Services, which also includes providing you with Sites and/or Services (i.e. providing you with the results of your search query);
(ii) the processing is necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations;
(iii) in case it is provided by applicable law, the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of Yandex and does not unduly affect your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Please note that when we process your Personal information on this basis, we will always seek to maintain a balance between our legitimate interest and the protection of your privacy.
Examples of such ‘legitimate interests’ referred in (iii) immediately above are:
(a) to better understand how you interact with our Sites and/or Services;
(b) to enhance, maintaining accessibility, modify, personalize or otherwise improve the Sites and Services for the benefit of all users; and
(c) to offer you other products and services from Yandex or other companies which we think can be of interest to you (i.e. personally-targeted advertising).
(iv) for specific purposes or if consent is required under the applicable laws and regulations, we may ask your consent for processing of your Personal information. In those jurisdictions in which consent is the legal basis, you provide such consent by agreeing to use our Sites and/or Services. We hereby inform you, and you hereby acknowledge, that you have no legal obligation to provide us with any Personal Information when you use the Sites or Services, and such provision is solely based on your free will. However, you are aware that without the provision of Personal Information, we will not be able to provide you with Services and your use of the Sites will be limited.
Yandex always processes your Personal information for a specific purpose and only processes Personal information, which is relevant to achieve that purpose. In particular, we process your Personal information for the following purposes:
(i) to provide you with the Sites and/or Services (i.e. delivery of search results in response to your search queries, taking into account your preferences, search history and other Personal information about you available to Yandex);
(ii) to provide you with access to your user account, including your email and storage service, if you have an account for these Services;
(iii) to contact you to notify and/or inform you or request information from you in relation to the Sites and Services, or to execute our agreements with you or process your request or application;

(v) to improve user experience, including offering more relevant search results and more personalised Sites and/or Services, as well as improving other Yandex products, applications and services;

Yandex uses the Received Data to provide you with the functions of Email Client. The Received Data is not offered for use by third parties, displaying advertising materials and other purposes related to unauthorized access to the content of your correspondence.
For more details on processing the Received Data, please visit: (

In most cases, Personal information is processed automatically without access to it by our staff. However, if such access is necessary, your Personal information can be accessed only by those Yandex employees whose professional tasks require using this information. To protect your Personal information and ensure its confidentiality, these employees must comply with internal rules and follow protocols for processing Personal information. They are also required to follow all technical and organisational security measures protecting your Personal information.
Yandex has also implemented adequate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal information against unauthorised, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, disclosure or access and against all other unlawful forms of processing. These security measures have been implemented taking into account the state of the art of the technology, their cost of implementation, the risks presented by the processing and the nature of Personal information.

Children’s Privacy
As a developer of children’s apps, we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
        (
http://www.coppa.org
).
COPPA gives parents control over the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. The U.S.
        Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces the COPPA rule, which details what steps operators of websites and online
        services must take to protect children’s online privacy and safety. Your child’s privacy is important, and we respect
        your privacy.
We do not request or collect any child-specific data such as names, ages, schools, etc., anywhere
        within the app.
We may ask about your child’s interests only to personalize their experience within the
        app and show relevant content. You can avoid personalized experiences by not providing any interests and using the
        default options. We do not allow third parties (including plugins) to collect personally identifiable information
        from children. In-app purchases or subscription services can only be accessed via the parent gate. The parent page
        is only accessible after correctly answering a verification question.
