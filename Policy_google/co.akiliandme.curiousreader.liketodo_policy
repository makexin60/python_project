What information does Curious Learning apps collect?
Our exact data collection changes over time, but we broadly collect two types of data:
1. Anonymized, aggregated usage data like what is tapped or clicked in the app, what level you reach, whether you succeeded on a level or failed, how much time is spent in the app, and what parts of the app you use. This 'usage data' (collected through a tool called Google Firebase) helps us figure out ways to improve the app.
2. Through the third-party services Google Firebase Analytics and Facebook, we obtain:
Anonymized usage and analytics data including what avenues a user may have found out about our app, app usage duration, device type and model, and limited demographic information such as country and city data for improvement of our app experience.
We have two reasons for collecting so much information from our apps: first, we want to use it to measure what users are learning and how, so we can personalize learning to make our apps much more effective – eventually, by allowing apps to tailor themselves to each child’s learning stage and style. Second, to help improve our apps and develop new technology for other e-learning apps to use, we share this information with researchers who are developing new ways to teach, measure, and personalize learning through technology.
How does Curious Learning use the information it collects?
* We may use the information in research studies intended to improve our understanding of how people learn with Curious Learning apps. The results of this research are shared with educators and researchers through conferences, journals, and other publications.
* We analyze the information to understand and improve Curious Learning apps, such as determining which activities are most popular or effective, which images are most used, and how long users spend in the app.
* We may disclose some of the information to third-party service providers, such as Google, Facebook, and Unity that help us perform various support functions (such as usage analytics and the number of installations). We are satisfied that these service providers have privacy policies that restrict them from further disclosing any of your information but these third-party service providers may collect or receive information from our app and other apps and use that information to provide measurement services and targeted ads. To learn more about how our third-party service providers use this information and to stop or limit their use of this information on your Android device, please visit the following websites:
‍
Google Privacy Policy
Facebook Privacy Policy
Unity Privacy Policy
‍
*. We may disclose some of the information to third-party researchers that seek to improve Curious Learning apps or develop complementary apps and other technology designed to improve learning.
How does Curious Learning protect you and your information?
*. Although Curious Learning apps use Firebase, they do not share any information they collect with Google, and Google does not collect any personal identifying information about you. Google Firebase acquires information during app usage which is sent back to Google servers, without any personally identifiable information.
*. We store our detailed usage data, as of July 2017, on servers hosted by Google. This detailed usage data may contain limited demographic information such as country and city, but it does not include personally identifiable information. In order for research partners to gain access to these data, they must sign a partnership agreement with Curious Learning, a data-sharing agreement stating that they will follow our data use and security policies.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
