Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
READ THIS SECTION 23 CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION 23 MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
23.1
Informal Dispute Resolution
Our customer service department is available as noted in Section 26 (Contacting Customer Service) to address any concerns, disputes, claims or controversies you may have regarding the italki Platform, these italki Terms or the relationship between you and italki (collectively, "
Disputes
"). Most Disputes are quickly resolved in this manner to our Members’ satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
23.2
Dispute Resolution for Residents outside of the United States
In the event that the parties do not agree upon a resolution in connection with a Dispute within a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated pursuant to Section 23.1 (Initial Dispute Resolution), except as otherwise specified in Section 23.3 (Dispute Resolution for Residents in the United States) below, you and italki expressly agree that any claim or action arising out of or relating to italki Platform or these italki Terms shall be submitted by any party to be finally resolved by arbitration by written notice to the other party. The arbitration shall be conducted in Hong Kong under the auspices of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center ("
HKIAC
"). The number of arbitrators shall be one (1) unless otherwise subsequently agreed in writing by the parties. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitration tribunal shall apply the arbitration rules of the HKIAC in effect at the time of the arbitration.
23.3
Dispute Resolution for Residents in the United States
If you are domiciled in and/or use the italki Platform in the United States, this Section 23.3 applies to you.
Agreement to Arbitrate.
If the parties do not agree upon a resolution in connection with a Dispute within a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated pursuant to Section 23.1 (Initial Dispute Resolution), then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims (the "
Agreement to Arbitrate
"), subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all Disputes shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "
AAA
"). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "
AAA Rules
") and, where appropriate, AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes (the "
AAA Consumer Rules
"). This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of these italki Terms notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in these italki Terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these italki Terms, including without limitation any claim that all or any party of these italki Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
The AAA Rules and the AAA Consumer Rules are both available at the AAA website
www.adr.org
. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the cost of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
Location.
The arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.
Class Action Waiver.
The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ITALKI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITALKI’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this subsection is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Disputes.
Exception – Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the italki Platform under this Agreement. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
Batch Arbitration.
If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar disputes, then you and italki agree that the AAA will administer them in batches of up to 25 claimants each (“
Batch
”), unless there are fewer than 25 claimants in total or after batching, in which case they will comprise a single Batch. The AAA will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings. For more details on the applicable fees, please refer to the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and Fee Schedule, available
here
.
30 Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Section 23.3(i) (Agreement to Arbitrate), Section 23.3(ii) (Location) and Section 23.3(iii) (Class Action Waiver) above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out pursuant to Section 21 (Notices). The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first access or use of the italki Platform; otherwise you will be bound to arbitrate Disputes in accordance with the terms of those Sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, italki also will not be bound by such provisions.
24.
Feedback
By sending us any ideas, suggestions, documents or proposals ("
Feedback
"), you agree that (i) your Feedback does not contain confidential or proprietary information of third parties, (ii) we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Feedback, (iii) we may have something similar to the Feedback already under consideration or in development, and (iv) you grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works of, publish, distribute and sublicense the Feedback and you irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against italki and other Members any claims and assertions of any moral rights that you may have with respect to such Feedback.
25.
General
The failure of italki to enforce any right or provision of these italki Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of italki. Except as expressly set forth in these italki Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these italki Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these italki Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these italki Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these italki Terms will remain in full force and effect.

When retrieving your password, we may need you to provide frequent login location, frequent login device, frequent listening content, registration time and city information. If necessary, we may also verify your true identity through face recognition.
Making a verifiable request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
We will send you confirmation of our receipt of any verifiable request within ten (10) business days of its receipt. We endeavour to substantively respond to any verifiable request within fifteen (15) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period required in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by the method you submitted your request.
If we cannot comply with a verifiable request, we will explain our reasons to you in writing, if applicable. Where we inform you that we cannot comply with a verifiable request, you may submit an appeal to us within a reasonable period of time following your receipt of our decision to refuse to process your request. In the event you submit an appeal, we will respond to you in writing within forty-five (45) days and disclose any action taken or not taken in response to your appeal and an explanation of our decisions. In some US states, you may have the right to submit your concerns with the result of the appeal to your attorney general.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another without hindrance.
Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information or to exercise any of your privacy rights. However, except in relation to consent withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing the request. We may also refuse to comply with your request in such circumstances.
We may decline to comply with your request under the following circumstances, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations:
Where it is related to our obligations under law and/or regulation
Where it is related to national security and national defense security
Where it is related to public safety, public health and major public interests
Where it is related to criminal investigation, prosecution, and trial
Where there is sufficient evidence to show that you have subjective malice or abuse of rights
Where responding to your request will cause serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of you or other individuals and organizations
Where trade secrets are involved
Other conditions stipulated by laws and regulations

We are providing you with the information contained in this section so that you may make an informed decision on whether to participate in our programs, such as:
Limited-Time Promotions, Contests, or Sweepstakes:
From time to time, we may offer certain financial incentives limited to a specific time period, such as limited-time sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions. In exchange for participation in these promotions, you may be offered a financial incentive, such as a prize. As part of these limited-time promotions, contests, or sweepstakes, we may collect your personal information such as your username, name, email address, or phone number.

We may also offer users the opportunity to participate in surveys. In exchange for participation you may be offered a financial incentive. As part of these surveys we may collect personal information, such as your name, username, email, phone number, preferences, experiences, beliefs, opinions, and other responses to the survey questions.
Referrals:
We may offer you certain financial incentives when you refer a friend to use our Services. To make a referral, we may require you to provide us with your username, name, telephone number, and/or email address.
Such financial incentives may not be available at all times. The amount and terms of such financial incentives will be presented to you at the time of the offer. The monetary value of any financial incentive will be based on our good-faith estimate of the benefit we receive when you accept our financial incentive offer. We calculate that monetary value by comparing our costs to offer you the financial incentive to the benefit we receive when you accept our offer.
By participating in any of our promotional programs, you agree that the benefits are reasonably related to the value of your personal information collected and retained. Participation in any promotional program is always optional, and you can terminate your participation by

The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
The AAA Rules and the AAA Consumer Rules are both available at the AAA website
www.adr.org
. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the cost of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
Location.
The arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.
Class Action Waiver.
The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ITALKI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITALKI’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this subsection is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Disputes.
Exception – Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the italki Platform under this Agreement. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
Batch Arbitration.
If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar disputes, then you and italki agree that the AAA will administer them in batches of up to 25 claimants each (“
Batch
”), unless there are fewer than 25 claimants in total or after batching, in which case they will comprise a single Batch. The AAA will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings. For more details on the applicable fees, please refer to the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and Fee Schedule, available
here
.
30 Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Section 23.3(i) (Agreement to Arbitrate), Section 23.3(ii) (Location) and Section 23.3(iii) (Class Action Waiver) above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out pursuant to Section 21 (Notices). The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first access or use of the italki Platform; otherwise you will be bound to arbitrate Disputes in accordance with the terms of those Sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, italki also will not be bound by such provisions.
24.
Feedback
By sending us any ideas, suggestions, documents or proposals ("
Feedback
"), you agree that (i) your Feedback does not contain confidential or proprietary information of third parties, (ii) we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Feedback, (iii) we may have something similar to the Feedback already under consideration or in development, and (iv) you grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works of, publish, distribute and sublicense the Feedback and you irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against italki and other Members any claims and assertions of any moral rights that you may have with respect to such Feedback.
25.
General
The failure of italki to enforce any right or provision of these italki Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of italki. Except as expressly set forth in these italki Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these italki Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these italki Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these italki Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these italki Terms will remain in full force and effect.

italki Subscription Service

Purchasing italki Paid Subscription Services.
italki accepts payment via the payment method indicated at the time of your purchase. You agree to pay the Subscription Fees for any Paid Subscription Services that you order. italki will charge your payment method for the amount listed for the relevant Paid Subscription Services. If you purchase any automatically renewing Paid Subscription Services, your italki account will be billed continuously for the Subscription Fees until you terminate your subscription as set forth below. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period. If the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or any other reason, and italki is unable to charge you for the next billing period, you may not be able to access the applicable Paid Subscription Services until you update your payment method. Where possible, we will provide you with notice when this happens. If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time following that notice, italki may cancel your subscription. In some cases, you may transact with a third-party or affiliate platform when you purchase a Paid Subscription Service (e.g., if you subscribed using another platform like Apple or Google Play). In these cases, such platform will charge your payment method and be responsible for managing any issues with your payment, including refunds.
From time to time, we may offer trials or other services related to Paid Subscription Services free of charge or at a discounted rate for a specified period as may be indicated on our platform. To participate in these offers, you might be required to have a valid, accepted payment method. We will remind you of any upcoming renewal charges when a free trial period ends, if the free trial period lasts for more than 31 days.
5.2
Cancelling Paid Subscription Services
You can cancel italki Paid Subscription Service any time. The cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period.

italki's Rights Regarding italki Accounts and Funds
6.1
Security and Financial Fraud
As a security measure, italki may impose transaction limits on some or all Students and Teachers relating to the value of any transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of transactions per day or other period of time. We will impose these limits before any services are rendered if we determine it is necessary for security reasons or the prevention of fraud.
italki reserves the right to void italki Credit purchases if purchases are found to be fraudulent. This includes italki Credits that have been redeemed from fraudulent italki gift card purchases.
6.2
Reservation of Rights for Erroneous Transactions
italki reserves the right to seek reimbursement from any Teacher or Student, if italki, in its sole discretion, determines that erroneous or duplicate transactions have occurred. italki may obtain such reimbursement by deducting from future payments owed to such Teacher, by reversing any italki Credits to such Teacher's Teacher Wallet, or by seeking reimbursement from such Teacher by any other lawful means.
6.3
Prohibition on Friendly Fraud
"Friendly Fraud" is when a person initiates a fraud dispute with a payment provider, claiming that their credit card (or other payment method) was not intended to be used. Because italki does not offer refunds, users that disagree with the policy have tried to use Friendly Fraud to receive a refund.
This type of behavior is illegal and prohibited by all payment providers. italki also strictly opposes Friendly Fraud. If Friendly Fraud is discovered, the Student's italki Account and Student Wallet will be deactivated, purchased credits will be confiscated, and the Student will be noted as a financial security risk.
In the case of honest mistakes, italki can reverse the transaction. We strongly advise Students to contact italki Customer Service to resolve any financial disputes.
7.
Prohibitions
In addition to complying with the restrictions regarding improper use of the italki Platform described in Section 12 (Restrictions) of the italki Terms, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, rules, regulations, and tax obligations that may apply to you in connection with the use of the Payment Services.

Attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any of the software used to provide the Payment Services;
Use credit cards or other payment methods fraudulently;

In addition, and as set in this Payment Policy, italki may take a range of actions against you, including but not limited to limiting access to your italki Account and any associated Payment Services, for a violation of this Payment Policy.
8.
Teacher – Student Dispute
In the event of a disagreement between a Teacher and a Student, italki encourages the Teacher and Student to communicate directly and attempt to resolve the disagreement. If a Teacher and Student are unable to resolve a disagreement and italki is asked to mediate, italki may request that the Teacher and Student both provide communication records regarding the dispute, which should show all key relevant information including the time, date and communication details. Although italki will attempt to evaluate the dispute on an impartial basis, italki will have the authority to resolve the dispute in its sole discretion, and italki’s resolution of the dispute will be final. As a result, italki shall have the right, in its sole discretion:
To transfer credits, offer a refund, or reverse a transaction.
To designate who shall bear the Platform Service Fees resulting from any such actions.

To exercise the access, data portability, correction, and deletion rights described above please submit a
verifiable request
to us by emailing us at support@italki.com.
Only you, or a person authorized by law to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to your personal information.
You may only make a verifiable request for access or data portability twice within a twelve (12) month period. The verifiable request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized agent
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
If your account is lost, you can verify through SMS or contact customer service to reset your password. However, in this process, you need to provide some personal information to verify your identity. When retrieving your password, we may need you to provide frequent login location, frequent login device, frequent listening content, registration time and city information. If necessary, we may also verify your true identity through face recognition.
Making a verifiable request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
We will send you confirmation of our receipt of any verifiable request within ten (10) business days of its receipt. We endeavour to substantively respond to any verifiable request within fifteen (15) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period required in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by the method you submitted your request.
If we cannot comply with a verifiable request, we will explain our reasons to you in writing, if applicable. Where we inform you that we cannot comply with a verifiable request, you may submit an appeal to us within a reasonable period of time following your receipt of our decision to refuse to process your request. In the event you submit an appeal, we will respond to you in writing within forty-five (45) days and disclose any action taken or not taken in response to your appeal and an explanation of our decisions. In some US states, you may have the right to submit your concerns with the result of the appeal to your attorney general.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another without hindrance.
Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information or to exercise any of your privacy rights. However, except in relation to consent withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing the request.

We are providing you with the information contained in this section so that you may make an informed decision on whether to participate in our programs, such as:
Limited-Time Promotions, Contests, or Sweepstakes:
From time to time, we may offer certain financial incentives limited to a specific time period, such as limited-time sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions. In exchange for participation in these promotions, you may be offered a financial incentive, such as a prize. As part of these limited-time promotions, contests, or sweepstakes, we may collect your personal information such as your username, name, email address, or phone number. Participation in a limited-time offer or promotion is governed by the applicable terms and conditions for the program.
One-Time Promotions:
We may offer you one-time promotions from time-to-time, and may collect your personal information related to the one-time promotion, such as your username, name, email address, or phone number. Participation in a one-time promotion is governed by the applicable terms and conditions for the program.
Surveys:
We may also offer users the opportunity to participate in surveys. In exchange for participation you may be offered a financial incentive. As part of these surveys we may collect personal information, such as your name, username, email, phone number, preferences, experiences, beliefs, opinions, and other responses to the survey questions.
Referrals:
We may offer you certain financial incentives when you refer a friend to use our Services. To make a referral, we may require you to provide us with your username, name, telephone number, and/or email address.
Such financial incentives may not be available at all times. The amount and terms of such financial incentives will be presented to you at the time of the offer. The monetary value of any financial incentive will be based on our good-faith estimate of the benefit we receive when you accept our financial incentive offer. We calculate that monetary value by comparing our costs to offer you the financial incentive to the benefit we receive when you accept our offer.
By participating in any of our promotional programs, you agree that the benefits are reasonably related to the value of your personal information collected and retained. Participation in any promotional program is always optional, and you can terminate your participation by

13. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
Because consumers are often unaware that their Do Not Track beacons are active, Do Not Track signals frequently do not reflect the actual preferences of our users. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals. In the meantime, you may opt out of certain types of tracking, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing your cookie settings or by using a universal opt-out mechanism in your browser. For more information, please see Section 10 (
Your Controls
) above.
