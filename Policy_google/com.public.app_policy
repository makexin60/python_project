For example, we use Google Analytics on our website to help us understand how users interact with our website; you can learn how Google collects and uses information at

Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies
We use cookies, web beacons, mobile analytics and advertising IDs, and similar technologies to operate our Services and to help collect data, including usage data, identifiers, and device information for the purposes described below.
What are cookies and similar technologies?
Cookies are small text files placed by a website and stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.
Web beacons are electronic images (also called single-pixel or clear GIFs) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third-party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content. We also include web beacons in our email messages or newsletters to tell us if you open and act on them.
Mobile analytics and advertising IDs are generated by operating systems for mobile devices (iOS and Android) and can be accessed and used by apps in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. Our apps contain software that enables us and our analytics and advertising providers to access these mobile IDs.
How do we and our providers use cookies and similar technologies?
We, and our analytics and advertising providers, use these technologies to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) when you use our Services, including personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services.  This personal information is used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our websites and apps perform, track your interaction with the site or app, develop inferences, detect, prevent, and combat illegal, fraudulent, and deceptive activity, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. We and/or our providers also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes. For more information about the third-party analytics and advertising providers that collect personal information on our Services, please see the “
Personal Information We Disclose
” section of this Privacy Policy.
What controls are available?
There are a range of cookie and related controls available through browsers, mobile operating systems, and elsewhere. See the “
Your Personal Information Choices
” section below for details.
How We Protect Personal Information
We take reasonable and appropriate steps to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
To help us protect your personal information, please use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.
Your Personal Information Choices
We provide a variety of ways for you to manage the personal information we hold about you, including choices about how we use that data. In some jurisdictions, these controls and choices may be enforceable as rights under applicable law.
Public account controls:
Your Profile
. You can edit your name, username, picture, bio, email, and phone number by visiting the “Edit Profile” section of the Public mobile app or website.
Account Information
. You can update your password, username, email, phone number, investment objective, and trusted contact by visiting the “Account Settings” page of the Public website or mobile app.
Your Portfolio and Trades
. By default, your Public investment portfolio and trades are publicly visible to other customers of the Services who visit your Public profile page. You can change these to “private” using the “Account Settings” page of the Public website or mobile app.
Contacts
. Using your device’s settings, you can withdraw permission for Public to access your contacts stored on your device.
Close Your Account
. You can close your account by visiting the “Account Settings” page of the Public website or mobile app. Even after you close your account, we retain certain personal information as required for legal, regulatory, and security purposes.  For more information, visit our
FAQ page
on closing your account.
Communications preferences
. You can choose whether to receive promotional communications from us by email, push notification, and/or SMS. Using your device’s settings, you can unsubscribe from push notifications by choosing the “Notification Settings” button in “Account Settings.” If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to stop, you can do so by following the directions in that message or by contacting us at
support@public.com
. These choices do not apply to certain informational communications including important information and documentation relating to your account.
Targeted advertising
. To opt-out from or otherwise control targeted advertising, you have several options.
Where available, you can use the controls available through our website cookie banner to decline advertising-related cookies.
You can use the opt-out controls offered by the organizations our advertising providers may participate in, which you can access at:
United States: NAI (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org
) and DAA (
http://optout.aboutads.info
)
Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (
https://youradchoices.ca
)
Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance (
https://www.youronlinechoices.com
)
You can use the other browser or platform controls described below.
These choices are specific to the device or browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems. Some privacy laws define “sale” or “sharing” broadly to include some of the disclosures described in the “
Personal Information We Disclose
” section above. To opt-out from such data “sales” or “sharing” please use one of the options described above.
Profiling and automated decision making
. Some privacy laws provide a right to opt-out from profiling and/or automated decision-making that produce a legal or similarly significant effect. We process personal information for targeted advertising purposes. To opt-out from targeted advertising, please use one of the options described in the section above titled “Targeted Advertising.”
Browser or platform controls:
Cookies controls
. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, then this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.
Do Not Track
. Some browsers include a “Do Not Track” (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. There is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal; therefore, our website does not respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use a range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.
Mobile advertising ID controls
. iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.
Email web beacons
. Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including web beacons, which prevents the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images.
Your Data Protection and Privacy Rights
California privacy rights
If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), then you have certain rights with respect to that information.
In general, the CCPA broadly protects personal information that businesses collect from California consumers. However, as described in the “
U.S. exemptions
” section below, the personal information you provide to us may be governed by the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (“GLBA”) or the California Financial Information Privacy Act and not the CCPA.
Notice at Collection.
At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the
categories
of personal information and sensitive personal information to be collected, the
purposes
for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is
sold or shared
, and how long such information is
retained
. You can find those details in this Privacy Policy by clicking on the above links.
Right to Know.
You have a right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected about you.  You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information.  Note that we have provided much of this information in this Privacy Policy. You may make such a “request to know” by emailing us at
privacy@public.com
.
Rights to Request Correction or Deletion.
You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate personal information and that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to correct or delete, please email us at
privacy@public.com
.
Right to Opt-Out / “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”.
You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” or “sharing” of personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA.
Note that the CCPA defines “sell,” “share” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this Privacy Policy may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under those definitions.
In the past 12 months, we have “sold” or “shared” the following categories of personal information: Internet or other electronic network activity. For information about the purposes for which this personal information is used and the categories of recipients with whom this data is shared, see the “Analytics and Advertising Providers” section of this Privacy Policy.
To opt-out from “sharing” of personal information, please review the options within the “
Your Personal Information Choices
” section of this Privacy Policy.
Other than the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information described above, we do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by the CCPA and have not done so in the past 12 months. Additionally, we do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.
You have a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services you request or as otherwise permitted by law.
Note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any such additional purposes.
Non-discrimination.
Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA.
Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.
To exercise your rights, please follow the directions in the “
Exercising your rights over your data
” section below. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing
privacy@public.com
. Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.
Privacy rights under other U.S. state laws (excluding California)
If you are a U.S. resident, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information under applicable state privacy laws (e.g. Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia). Such rights may include (in each case subject to applicable law):
Right to confirm we are processing personal information about you and request access to such personal information
Right to correct inaccurate information
Right to delete personal information provided by or obtained about you
Right to obtain a copy of personal information provided by you in a portable (and to the extent technically feasible) format
To opt out of the processing of the personal information for purposes of (i) targeted advertising, (ii) the sale of personal information, or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer, in each case as further detailed by the underlying U.S. state law
Right to appeal a decision we make with respect to your privacy rights by submitting your request to
privacy@public.com
To exercise your rights, please follow the directions in the “
Exercising your rights over your data
” section below.
As further outlined in the “
U.S. exemptions
” section below, please note that in certain cases personal information may be covered by the GLBA and not your applicable state privacy laws.
Exercising your rights over your data
In order to process your request, we will need to verify or authenticate your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide other information necessary to verify your account.
Except for the automated controls described in the “
Your Personal Information Choices
” section above, if you send us a request to exercise your rights, then to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a fee or decline requests in certain cases.
For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or other rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, or would interfere with a legal, regulatory or business obligation that requires retention or use of the data.
We may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law.
Where permitted by applicable law, you may also designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
Where permitted by applicable law, if you receive a response from us informing you that we have declined your request, in whole or in part, you may appeal that decision by submitting your appeal using the contact method described at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
U.S. exemptions
U.S. state privacy laws generally do not apply to personal information that is subject to the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), a federal law that governs nonpublic personal information collected from customers by financial institutions. If you have applied for or opened a brokerage account with Public, then the personal information you provide to us may be covered by the GLBA and not your applicable state privacy laws. In that case, your information is governed by this Privacy Policy and the GLBA, and the rights provided under the U.S. privacy rights sections do not apply.
Similarly, the CCPA does not apply to personal information that is subject to the California Financial Information Privacy Act.
For a summary of how we use personal information covered by the GLBA, please review this
U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice
.
How We Retain Personal Information
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide our Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can differ significantly based on criteria such as customer expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable customers to delete data, and our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations.
Links to Third-Party Websites and Services
Our Services may contain links to other websites, products or services that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these non-affiliated third parties. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third-party services or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.
Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under 18 years of age, and no part of our Services are directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at
privacy@public.com
with Subject Line: Children’s Privacy.

Right to Data Portability.
In certain circumstances, you may have the right to data portability. Data portability allows you to request a machine-readable copy of your personal data where our legal basis for processing is either performance of a contract or consent.
Withdrawal of Consent.
When we rely on consent to use your personal data, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time.
Automated decision-making (including profiling).
If we make a solely automated decision (including profiling) about you that produces a legal or other significant effect on you, then you have the right to object to such decision.
Complaints.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us at privacy@public.com with any questions or concerns.
To exercise your rights, please follow the directions in the “
Exercising your rights over your data
” section below. If you have an Alpha account, but do not have a Public brokerage account, then many of the provisions of this Privacy Policy do not apply to you. You can direct any questions about Alpha to

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

Google Analytics and privacy

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
