During the flight ticket booking process, the User may be informed that by selecting a particular flight ticket they will be obliged to monitor possible flight schedule changes directly with the Carrier.

Providing email addresses during the booking process:
For all communication between the User and the Carrier without the intervention of eSky, the User is required to use the same email address that they used to make the reservation in the Reservation System. Failure to do so means that, eSky will be unable to support the User in its service.

link

§ 9. The MultiLine service (+Shield Protection)
General Provisions
A flight designated as “MultiLine”, available to Users in the Reservation System, includes at least two connecting flights, with one transfer or multiple transfers and one or more Carriers involved, and for which separate tickets are issued. In this situation, each part of the route takes place on the basis of a separate ticket and is considered a separate service that is unrelated to other services provided as part of the Trip. Additionally, in such instances, it does not matter whether separate tickets are issued for the services of several carriers or just a single one (“MultiLine”). A combination of flights found via the Booking System as part of the MultiLine service shall hereinafter be referred to as a “Trip”.
Purchasing a MultiLine ticket means purchasing more than one air ticket involving at least one connecting flight, for which the User receives separate flight tickets with one or more carriers as part of a single transaction process in the Booking System. The sum of tickets purchased for a given MultiLine Trip is not a single combined flight ticket that encompasses all individual flights, which are part of the Trip.
Due to the fact that the MultiLine service is provided on the basis of separate flight tickets, through one or more carriers, and as part of a single Trip, the User is obliged to verify the luggage handling rules on all stages of the Trip, as well as the documents that authorise them to utilise the service, including entry or transit visas, which may be required in the country in which the MultiLine service is provided or in which a transfer to another flight takes place.
Purchasing separate tickets for different flights by the User as part of the MultiLine service may be potentially subject to the risk of cancellation, delay or change of flight time and the resulting inability of the User to use another connection(s) which is part of the Trip, due to the fact that the transfer periods between individual air connections may be short (depending on the search parameters indicated by the User and the availability of flights in the Booking System).
The availability of the MultiLine service in the case of different flight combinations depends on the availability of flight tickets of individual Carriers, as well as the criteria determined by the Users in the Booking System.
If information about a MultiLine offer appears next to the search results, all persons travelling on the basis of tickets purchased as part of an offer marked in this way will be covered by the eSky assistance (“Shield Protection”) at an additional, non-refundable fee. This means that after purchasing tickets as part of this Trip, Users can receive assistance from eSky based on the terms established below:
The basis for using the Shield Protection
The User may take advantage of the Shield Protection if one of the connections which are part of the Trip is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled, resulting in the inability of the User to make a planned transfer or reach their destination.
If the User receives information about a cancellation, delay or change in schedule of at least one of the MultiLine connections, which would result in their inability to successfully make the Trip, the User shall notify eSky that they are unable to make use of the next air connection that is part of the Trip, as well as the reasons for it, based on the following terms:
if the User learns about the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections more than 48 hours before the scheduled start the Trip and if such an event will result in the inability of the User to make the Trip, the User is entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection service, provided that they immediately notify eSky by phone or e-mail within 24 hours from the moment they receive such information.
if the User learns about the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections less than 48 hours before the scheduled start of the Trip and if such an event will result in the inability of the User to make the Trip, the User is entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection service, provided that they notify eSky by phone or e-mail within 12 hours from the moment they receive such information and at least 8 hours before the scheduled start of the Trip).
If the User becomes aware of the cancellation, delay or time change of at least one of the MultiLine connecting flights during the course of the Trip, i.e. between individual connecting flights or during a transfer to the next section of the Trip or later than 8 hours before the start of the Trip, they may use the Shield Protection service, provided that they notify eSky immediately, but no later than within 1 hour from obtaining such information, by phone or via the email address provided.
Failure to notify eSky within the aforementioned timeframes shall result in the inability to cover the given Trip with the Shield Protection service.
User notifications are accepted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, only via the dedicated phone number, provided in the “MultiLine” tab on the eSky website ((+1) 2014735488) (call charges are according to your network operator's rate) and via e-mail, at
multiline@esky.com
. Customer support is available in the language of the eSky website via which the MultiLine service was purchased, or in English, depending on the availability of the eSky consultants.
The User shall be entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection only if they exercise due diligence that can be expected from a traveller who wishes to make it on time to each successive connection that is part of the Trip, even if a cancellation, delay or change of schedule occurs in the case of at least one of the MultiLine connections, resulting in the User’s inability to make the Trip, and only provided that the User does not make changes to the documentation necessary to make the Trip without informing eSky about that.
As part of the Shield Protection service, relevant parties reserve the right to verify and determine the times of arrival and departure of aircraft, as well as the amount of time available for transfers between different air connections, based on the systems used by eSky and based on data in the GDS booking system or at the www.flightstats.com website.
The scope of assistance available to the User via the Shield Protection service:
After receiving information about the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections, resulting in the inability to make the Trip, from a User entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection, the User will be notified of any available alternative connections that will allow them to reach the Trip destination (hereinafter referred to as “Alternative Connection”).
If a User misses an air connection as a result of a cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections included in a Trip, which results in the inability of the User to make the Trip, the User shall have the right to choose:
An Alternative Connection available under the Shield Protection service can only be provided if the costs of the Alternative Connection that eSky would be subject to do not exceed the value greater than EUR 1,000 (the "Limit") expressed in currency in which the MultiLine transaction is made.
Should eSky fail to present an Alternative Connection up to the Limit, the User will be entitled to a refund in the amount of the total value of the air tickets purchased for the purpose of the MultiLine Trip, instead of covering the costs of the Alternative Connection. The value of the refund does not include the value of services other than airline tickets purchased under the MultiLine service (e.g. costs of purchased tours, hotel booking, etc.). In order to receive a refund of the amount spent on a MultiLine ticket, the User must submit evidence confirming that the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections prevented them from completing their Trip. This evidence shall be the basis for eSky to decide whether a refund can be issued.
In instances where the stopover time caused by a cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least MultiLine connections exceeds 8 hours and the originally-planned Trip time, and partly or entirely takes place during the night hours (10.00 p.m.–06.00 a.m. of the local time in the area in which the Trip was interrupted), and the User decides to take advantage of the Alternative Connection option, the User shall have the right to:
one overnight stay at a hotel provided by eSky or, in instances where that is impossible, reimbursement of costs of booking a room by the User, up to EUR 100 per person. Such reimbursement can only be issued if the User submits documentation from the hotel that would confirm that they made the payment and that the purchased service was implemented by the hotel.
reimbursement of transport costs (according to the principle of 1 taxi - 4 people) on the route to/from the hotel/airport, in the amount of up to EUR 50, on the basis of documentation confirming that the payment was issued, and the transport service was implemented
reimbursement of the costs of meals, up to EUR 25 per person, based on documentation confirming payments for meals.
In exceptional cases, if the User is unable to contact eSky regarding the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections, the User is entitled to purchase tickets that will enable them to travel to their destination on their own. eSky, on the basis of the proof provided by the User that confirms the inability to contact eSky as well as the document that confirms the purchase of such tickets, will refund the value of these tickets up to the value of the tickets purchased as part of the Trip, but no more than up to the Limit. eSky will examine all such exceptional cases on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it was indeed impossible for the User to notify eSky about the aforementioned issues. Such investigations will be carried out on the basis of all available information and data regarding Trip implementation, and it is on their basis that eSky will decide whether a reimbursement shall be issued.
Any and all reimbursements of costs incurred and documented by the Users shall be made in accordance with the payment form chosen by the User during booking. In the case of reimbursements transferred directly to the User’s account indicated in the Booking System, the reimbursement amount established as part of the Shield Protection service shall be reduced by any amounts refunded directly to the User by the airlines at particular stages of the Shield Protection service, up to a maximum of the value of all tickets purchased for the purpose of the MultiLine Trip.
Refunds will be made on the terms and within time provided for by individual carriers, therefore the deadline for the refund under the Shield Protection service depends on the dates of these refunds by specific carriers whose services the User used as part of MultiLine.
The Shield Protection service shall not cover any other costs that may result from delays, cancellations or changes in schedules of at least one MultiLine connection, which the User decides to incur as part of the Alternative Connection service, in particular, costs related to transport and meals, other than those described above.
In order to use the Shield Protection, the User may be required to undertake certain actions, as directed by an eSky consultant. For example, they may be asked to report to a specific point at the airport, where they will be able to settle any formalities related to replacing their unused tickets and continuing the Trip. Failure to complete these actions shall prevent the User from taking advantage of the Shield Protection service.
Shield Protection service covers flight connections for selected carriers that are provided on the basis of a single flight ticket, under the same conditions as the Multiline connections described in § 9. Please note that each Carrier’s tariff terms may contain different provisions and conditions that apply to the Trip, therefore Users are requested to familiarise themselves with the individual terms that apply. eSky shall not be liable for any inconvenience that the User may suffer due to the non-application of any Carrier’s tariff terms and conditions.
User support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week exclusively at the dedicated phone number +12 014 735 488 (calls are charged according to your network operator’s standard tariff), as indicated on the eSky website and via email:
multiline@esky.com
. User support is available in the language of the eSky website where the service was originally purchased, or in English, depending on the availability of eSky consultants.
If an alternative connection or other services specified in these Regulations (e.g. transport, meals) are provided by the airline or the airport, or in instances where the aforementioned entities are obliged to provide the User with such services, the Shield Protection protection shall not apply.
Any loss of luggage that occurs due to reasons beyond the control of eSky shall not result in the inability of the User to make the Trip and shall not authorise the User to use the Shield Protection.
Purchasing/changing a ticket that is part of a Trip covered by the Shield Protection service independently by the User prevents them from taking advantage of the Shield Protection service, with the exception of the provisions of paragraph II. 4.
The Shield Protection service does not apply in instances where the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one MultiLine connections was a result of a strike organised by employees of airlines or any other services that are involved in servicing flights, as well as in the event of the airline going bankrupt, issues caused by force majeure, issues directly related to local and international warfare and acts of terror.
Shield Protection does not apply when the Carrier performs mass cancellation of flights, however, the phenomenon of mass cancellation occurs when the Carrier cancels or plans to cancel at least 5 flights from the planned schedule in one day.
The User is not entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection service after their Trip has ended.
In order to use the Shield Protection service, the User is required to cooperate with eSky, and in particular, submit all documents and information that the eSky consultants ask for at any stage of the Trip, as well as after the Trip itself has ended.

§ 10. PACKAGES FLIGHT+HOTEL
As part of the services available in the Booking System or through the Call Center, Users can book at least two different types of services, including at least the purchase of an Air Ticket and Hotel service, which will constitute the basis for concluding an agreement for participation in package travel between the User and eSky ( "Agreement").
The Agreement is concluded only if the services covered by this clause are implemented, the acceptance of which takes place via the Reservation System or via the Customer Service Centre. Confirmation of the conclusion of the Agreement and its components will be sent by a separate document to the e-mail address indicated in the Reservation System or via the Customer Service Centre. Considering the above, the Tour Operator and the User agree that communication regarding the implementation of the provisions of this clause takes place in electronic form, and a durable medium shall be an e-mail message and PDF documents sent to the User as confirmation of the service.
The tour operator for the User making the selection of individual services on the terms specified in this paragraph of the Terms is eSky.pl Spółka Akcyjna, with headquarters in Katowice (40-265), at ul. Murckowska 14A, registered in the Register of Entrepreneurs kept by the Katowice-Wschód District Court in Katowice, 8th Commercial Division of the National Court Register under the number KRS 0000383663, NIP 948-19-87-199, REGON 670140736, share capital PLN 1 060 877,50 paid in full.
The tour operator is responsible for the provision of services covered by this paragraph of the Terms and the Agreement, regardless of whether these services are to be carried out by the tour operator or by other Service Providers. eSky, in accordance with the applicable law, limits its liability for non-performance or improper performance of its services up to three times the price of a package travel for each User. This limitation does not apply to damage to persons or damage caused intentionally or as a result of negligence.
The tour operator shall immediately provide appropriate assistance to the User who found himself in a difficult situation, including circumstances where it is impossible to ensure his return to the country in accordance with the Agreement due to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, the tour operator bears the costs of necessary accommodation of the User , if possible, of a category equivalent to the one specified in the Agreement, for a period of up to 3 nights.
The reservation of services specified in this paragraph of the Terms is made in accordance with the parameters and criteria indicated individually by the User, under which, within the Booking System or through the Call Center, appropriate information will be provided regarding the details of the services and main features of the travel services, the rights and obligations of the User and the tour operator.
The tour operator informs that effective performance of certain services covered by the Agreement may depend on communication in the official language of the destination of travel or in English language.
The detailed scope of information regarding the provision of services via the Booking System is provided within Annex No. 1 to these Terms and Conditions.
The detailed scope of information regarding the provision of services via the Call Center is provided within Annex No. 4 to these Terms and Conditions.
The User for whom services are specified in this paragraph of the Terms is protected against the insolvency of the tour operator on the terms set out in Annex No. 1 and 4 to these Terms and Conditions.
Indicated in the Booking System or through the Call Center price for services under this paragraph of the Terms includes the price of the travel package including taxes and, if necessary, any additional fees and other costs or - if it cannot reasonably be expected that these costs will be calculated before conclusion of the Agreement - information on the type of additional costs that the User may be charged with.

passenger transport prices resulting from changes in the cost of fuel or other power sources;
the amount of taxes or fees from services covered by the agreement for participation in package travel, imposed by entities that do not participate directly in the implementation of the package travel, including tourist taxes, airport charges or fees for boarding and disembarkation in ports and on airports;
exchange rates relevant for a given package travel
The final price set in the Agreement cannot be increased within 20 days before the start date of the services referred to in this paragraph of the Terms.
The User may withdraw from the travel package contract at any time before its commencement. However, the User will be required to pay an appropriate fee justified by the actual costs incurred in organising the travel package. If the travel package contract f does not specify any withdrawal fees f, the amount of this feel must correspond to the price of the travel package minus the saved costs or revenue from alternative tourist services. The refund will depend on the Service Provider’s cancellation policies. At the traveller's request, the tour operator must provide proof of the withdrawal fee amount for participation in the travel package contract. The User may cancel the Flight+Hotel Package only in its entirety. Cancelling one of the components of the Package will result in a cancellation of the whole booking and its remaining components.
The agreement for participation in package travel may indicate a fee for withdrawal from the Agreement in the amount depending on the time when withdrawn from the Agreement has been made before the start of the package travel, from the expected cost savings and expected income from the alternative use of the travel services concerned. The fee is subject to a deduction from the payment made by the traveler.
The User may withdraw the Agreement before the start of the package travel without incurring additional fee in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances occurring at the destination or its immediate vicinity, which have a significant impact on the implementation of the package travel or carriage of travelers to the destination. The User may only request reimbursement of payments made for the package travel, without compensation or redress in this regard.
The tour operator is entitled to unilaterally make minor changes to the terms and conditions of the Agreement after informing the User in advance. Other changes that can be made before the start of the travel package, including changing the main elements of the tourist services, the inability to meet special requirements, or increasing the price exceeding 8% of the total price of the travel package, are implemented after immediately informing the User and presenting available substitute services and the rules for their implementation.

As part of the services covered by this paragraph of the Terms, the User may, without the consent of the tour operator, transfer to the person fulfilling the conditions of participation in the package travel all entitlements due to him regarding the participation of such package travel, if at the same time the person assumes all obligations resulting from this Agreement and if the User will inform the tour operator about this within a reasonable time and on durable information medium. If the transfer of rights and the assumption of duties entails additional costs for the tour operator, the tour operator is obliged to show them to the traveler when requesting payment, e.g. the costs of changing the User's data. These costs must be reasonable and must not exceed the actual costs incurred by the tour operator as a result of the transfer of the travel package. Notifications submitted no later than 7 days before the start of the package travel shall in any case be deemed to have been filed within a reasonable time.

Flight changes without a service fee
- changes are made via the User Service Centre indicated in the Reservation System. The User is exempt from service fees charged by eSky for individual additional services, as indicated in the Service Fees Table and included in the scope of the purchased Support Package.

Failure to supply contact details, providing data for online check-in less than 48 hours before the planned departure, supplying out-of-date or incomplete details, failure to answer phone calls from eSky or supplying incorrect details required for check-in may make it impossible to proceed with the online check-in and the User may incur additional charges at the airport defined by the airline or it may be impossible for them to depart.

A party to such an agreement is always the User and the Service Provider designated and specified in the offer, an entrepreneur providing services being the subject of the agreement.
The selected hotel services offered by Suppliers are presented in a way adjusted to the details of the services selected by the User and sorted by default to match the selected preferences of the enquiry made by the User, based on the following parameters:
destination
type of stay: short break, citybreak (2-4 days), holiday (5-14 days)

Agreements concluded through the Booking System are concluded and executed under the general terms and conditions of agreements with individual Service Providers or Suppliers. All data contained in the offer presented in the Booking System are based on data provided directly by the Suppliers. Booking terms and conditions, including liability and guarantee issues concerning hotel services provided by Suppliers  are subject to the terms and conditions specified in the order and in accordance with their regulations – e.g.

A possibility to use services provided by Suppliers in any chosen way, customised by the User, available on

The rules of bookings and payments for hotel services:
Depending on the choice of the services of a particular Supplier, a hotel service is booked through the Booking System simultaneously with the User making payment, within the deadlines resulting from the offer of the given facility, directly to the Supplier offering the facility, without payment to eSky (payment in the hotel or in the manner indicated by the Supplier) or by means of payment made available by eSky.

During the flight ticket booking process, the User may be informed that by selecting a particular flight ticket they will be obliged to monitor possible flight schedule changes directly with the Carrier. This means that eSky will not inform the User about any changes, and thus the User will have to monitor changes independently and react to them accordingly. Should the Carrier fail to provide the User with relevant information regarding their reservation which would make it impossible to provide the service, they should contact eSky immediately in order to determine the status and the possibility of making necessary changes to the reservation.
Providing email addresses during the booking process:
For all communication between the User and the Carrier without the intervention of eSky, the User is required to use the same email address that they used to make the reservation in the Reservation System. Failure to do so means that, eSky will be unable to support the User in its service.
eSky reserves the right to use the e-mail address provided by the User in the Reservation System to confirm and modify reservations with the Carrier.

link
eSky will redirect the User to the Ryanair website. There, the User must log in or create a "myRyanair" account using the same email address provided during the booking process on the eSky website. Once logged in to their "myRyanair" account, the User must verify their details and complete the purchase of the Ryanair ticket. eSky shares the User's data required to complete the booking with Ryanair.

§ 9. The MultiLine service (+Shield Protection)
General Provisions
A flight designated as “MultiLine”, available to Users in the Reservation System, includes at least two connecting flights, with one transfer or multiple transfers and one or more Carriers involved, and for which separate tickets are issued. In this situation, each part of the route takes place on the basis of a separate ticket and is considered a separate service that is unrelated to other services provided as part of the Trip. Additionally, in such instances, it does not matter whether separate tickets are issued for the services of several carriers or just a single one (“MultiLine”). A combination of flights found via the Booking System as part of the MultiLine service shall hereinafter be referred to as a “Trip”.
Purchasing a MultiLine ticket means purchasing more than one air ticket involving at least one connecting flight, for which the User receives separate flight tickets with one or more carriers as part of a single transaction process in the Booking System. The sum of tickets purchased for a given MultiLine Trip is not a single combined flight ticket that encompasses all individual flights, which are part of the Trip.
Due to the fact that the MultiLine service is provided on the basis of separate flight tickets, through one or more carriers, and as part of a single Trip, the User is obliged to verify the luggage handling rules on all stages of the Trip, as well as the documents that authorise them to utilise the service, including entry or transit visas, which may be required in the country in which the MultiLine service is provided or in which a transfer to another flight takes place.
Purchasing separate tickets for different flights by the User as part of the MultiLine service may be potentially subject to the risk of cancellation, delay or change of flight time and the resulting inability of the User to use another connection(s) which is part of the Trip, due to the fact that the transfer periods between individual air connections may be short (depending on the search parameters indicated by the User and the availability of flights in the Booking System).
The availability of the MultiLine service in the case of different flight combinations depends on the availability of flight tickets of individual Carriers, as well as the criteria determined by the Users in the Booking System.
If information about a MultiLine offer appears next to the search results, all persons travelling on the basis of tickets purchased as part of an offer marked in this way will be covered by the eSky assistance (“Shield Protection”) at an additional, non-refundable fee. This means that after purchasing tickets as part of this Trip, Users can receive assistance from eSky based on the terms established below:
The basis for using the Shield Protection
The User may take advantage of the Shield Protection if one of the connections which are part of the Trip is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled, resulting in the inability of the User to make a planned transfer or reach their destination.
If the User receives information about a cancellation, delay or change in schedule of at least one of the MultiLine connections, which would result in their inability to successfully make the Trip, the User shall notify eSky that they are unable to make use of the next air connection that is part of the Trip, as well as the reasons for it, based on the following terms:
if the User learns about the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections more than 48 hours before the scheduled start the Trip and if such an event will result in the inability of the User to make the Trip, the User is entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection service, provided that they immediately notify eSky by phone or e-mail within 24 hours from the moment they receive such information.

If the User becomes aware of the cancellation, delay or time change of at least one of the MultiLine connecting flights during the course of the Trip, i.e. between individual connecting flights or during a transfer to the next section of the Trip or later than 8 hours before the start of the Trip, they may use the Shield Protection service, provided that they notify eSky immediately, but no later than within 1 hour from obtaining such information, by phone or via the email address provided.
Failure to notify eSky within the aforementioned timeframes shall result in the inability to cover the given Trip with the Shield Protection service.
User notifications are accepted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, only via the dedicated phone number, provided in the “MultiLine” tab on the eSky website ((+1) 2014735488) (call charges are according to your network operator's rate) and via e-mail, at
multiline@esky.com
. Customer support is available in the language of the eSky website via which the MultiLine service was purchased, or in English, depending on the availability of the eSky consultants.
The User shall be entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection only if they exercise due diligence that can be expected from a traveller who wishes to make it on time to each successive connection that is part of the Trip, even if a cancellation, delay or change of schedule occurs in the case of at least one of the MultiLine connections, resulting in the User’s inability to make the Trip, and only provided that the User does not make changes to the documentation necessary to make the Trip without informing eSky about that.
As part of the Shield Protection service, relevant parties reserve the right to verify and determine the times of arrival and departure of aircraft, as well as the amount of time available for transfers between different air connections, based on the systems used by eSky and based on data in the GDS booking system or at the www.flightstats.com website.
The scope of assistance available to the User via the Shield Protection service:
After receiving information about the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections, resulting in the inability to make the Trip, from a User entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection, the User will be notified of any available alternative connections that will allow them to reach the Trip destination (hereinafter referred to as “Alternative Connection”).
If a User misses an air connection as a result of a cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections included in a Trip, which results in the inability of the User to make the Trip, the User shall have the right to choose:
An Alternative Connection available under the Shield Protection service can only be provided if the costs of the Alternative Connection that eSky would be subject to do not exceed the value greater than EUR 1,000 (the "Limit") expressed in currency in which the MultiLine transaction is made.
Should eSky fail to present an Alternative Connection up to the Limit, the User will be entitled to a refund in the amount of the total value of the air tickets purchased for the purpose of the MultiLine Trip, instead of covering the costs of the Alternative Connection. The value of the refund does not include the value of services other than airline tickets purchased under the MultiLine service (e.g. costs of purchased tours, hotel booking, etc.). In order to receive a refund of the amount spent on a MultiLine ticket, the User must submit evidence confirming that the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections prevented them from completing their Trip. This evidence shall be the basis for eSky to decide whether a refund can be issued.
In instances where the stopover time caused by a cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least MultiLine connections exceeds 8 hours and the originally-planned Trip time, and partly or entirely takes place during the night hours (10.00 p.m.–06.00 a.m. of the local time in the area in which the Trip was interrupted), and the User decides to take advantage of the Alternative Connection option, the User shall have the right to:
one overnight stay at a hotel provided by eSky or, in instances where that is impossible, reimbursement of costs of booking a room by the User, up to EUR 100 per person. Such reimbursement can only be issued if the User submits documentation from the hotel that would confirm that they made the payment and that the purchased service was implemented by the hotel.
reimbursement of transport costs (according to the principle of 1 taxi - 4 people) on the route to/from the hotel/airport, in the amount of up to EUR 50, on the basis of documentation confirming that the payment was issued, and the transport service was implemented
reimbursement of the costs of meals, up to EUR 25 per person, based on documentation confirming payments for meals.
In exceptional cases, if the User is unable to contact eSky regarding the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one of the MultiLine connections, the User is entitled to purchase tickets that will enable them to travel to their destination on their own. eSky, on the basis of the proof provided by the User that confirms the inability to contact eSky as well as the document that confirms the purchase of such tickets, will refund the value of these tickets up to the value of the tickets purchased as part of the Trip, but no more than up to the Limit. eSky will examine all such exceptional cases on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it was indeed impossible for the User to notify eSky about the aforementioned issues. Such investigations will be carried out on the basis of all available information and data regarding Trip implementation, and it is on their basis that eSky will decide whether a reimbursement shall be issued.
Any and all reimbursements of costs incurred and documented by the Users shall be made in accordance with the payment form chosen by the User during booking. In the case of reimbursements transferred directly to the User’s account indicated in the Booking System, the reimbursement amount established as part of the Shield Protection service shall be reduced by any amounts refunded directly to the User by the airlines at particular stages of the Shield Protection service, up to a maximum of the value of all tickets purchased for the purpose of the MultiLine Trip.
Refunds will be made on the terms and within time provided for by individual carriers, therefore the deadline for the refund under the Shield Protection service depends on the dates of these refunds by specific carriers whose services the User used as part of MultiLine.
The Shield Protection service shall not cover any other costs that may result from delays, cancellations or changes in schedules of at least one MultiLine connection, which the User decides to incur as part of the Alternative Connection service, in particular, costs related to transport and meals, other than those described above.
In order to use the Shield Protection, the User may be required to undertake certain actions, as directed by an eSky consultant. For example, they may be asked to report to a specific point at the airport, where they will be able to settle any formalities related to replacing their unused tickets and continuing the Trip. Failure to complete these actions shall prevent the User from taking advantage of the Shield Protection service.
Shield Protection service covers flight connections for selected carriers that are provided on the basis of a single flight ticket, under the same conditions as the Multiline connections described in § 9. Please note that each Carrier’s tariff terms may contain different provisions and conditions that apply to the Trip, therefore Users are requested to familiarise themselves with the individual terms that apply. eSky shall not be liable for any inconvenience that the User may suffer due to the non-application of any Carrier’s tariff terms and conditions.
User support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week exclusively at the dedicated phone number +12 014 735 488 (calls are charged according to your network operator’s standard tariff), as indicated on the eSky website and via email:
multiline@esky.com
. User support is available in the language of the eSky website where the service was originally purchased, or in English, depending on the availability of eSky consultants.
If an alternative connection or other services specified in these Regulations (e.g. transport, meals) are provided by the airline or the airport, or in instances where the aforementioned entities are obliged to provide the User with such services, the Shield Protection protection shall not apply.
Any loss of luggage that occurs due to reasons beyond the control of eSky shall not result in the inability of the User to make the Trip and shall not authorise the User to use the Shield Protection.
Purchasing/changing a ticket that is part of a Trip covered by the Shield Protection service independently by the User prevents them from taking advantage of the Shield Protection service, with the exception of the provisions of paragraph II. 4.
The Shield Protection service does not apply in instances where the cancellation, delay or rescheduling of at least one MultiLine connections was a result of a strike organised by employees of airlines or any other services that are involved in servicing flights, as well as in the event of the airline going bankrupt, issues caused by force majeure, issues directly related to local and international warfare and acts of terror.
Shield Protection does not apply when the Carrier performs mass cancellation of flights, however, the phenomenon of mass cancellation occurs when the Carrier cancels or plans to cancel at least 5 flights from the planned schedule in one day.
The User is not entitled to take advantage of the Shield Protection service after their Trip has ended.
In order to use the Shield Protection service, the User is required to cooperate with eSky, and in particular, submit all documents and information that the eSky consultants ask for at any stage of the Trip, as well as after the Trip itself has ended.

§ 10. PACKAGES FLIGHT+HOTEL
As part of the services available in the Booking System or through the Call Center, Users can book at least two different types of services, including at least the purchase of an Air Ticket and Hotel service, which will constitute the basis for concluding an agreement for participation in package travel between the User and eSky ( "Agreement").
The Agreement is concluded only if the services covered by this clause are implemented, the acceptance of which takes place via the Reservation System or via the Customer Service Centre. Confirmation of the conclusion of the Agreement and its components will be sent by a separate document to the e-mail address indicated in the Reservation System or via the Customer Service Centre. Considering the above, the Tour Operator and the User agree that communication regarding the implementation of the provisions of this clause takes place in electronic form, and a durable medium shall be an e-mail message and PDF documents sent to the User as confirmation of the service.
The tour operator for the User making the selection of individual services on the terms specified in this paragraph of the Terms is eSky.pl Spółka Akcyjna, with headquarters in Katowice (40-265), at ul. Murckowska 14A, registered in the Register of Entrepreneurs kept by the Katowice-Wschód District Court in Katowice, 8th Commercial Division of the National Court Register under the number KRS 0000383663, NIP 948-19-87-199, REGON 670140736, share capital PLN 1 060 877,50 paid in full.
The tour operator is responsible for the provision of services covered by this paragraph of the Terms and the Agreement, regardless of whether these services are to be carried out by the tour operator or by other Service Providers. eSky, in accordance with the applicable law, limits its liability for non-performance or improper performance of its services up to three times the price of a package travel for each User. This limitation does not apply to damage to persons or damage caused intentionally or as a result of negligence.
The tour operator shall immediately provide appropriate assistance to the User who found himself in a difficult situation, including circumstances where it is impossible to ensure his return to the country in accordance with the Agreement due to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, the tour operator bears the costs of necessary accommodation of the User , if possible, of a category equivalent to the one specified in the Agreement, for a period of up to 3 nights.
The reservation of services specified in this paragraph of the Terms is made in accordance with the parameters and criteria indicated individually by the User, under which, within the Booking System or through the Call Center, appropriate information will be provided regarding the details of the services and main features of the travel services, the rights and obligations of the User and the tour operator.
The tour operator informs that effective performance of certain services covered by the Agreement may depend on communication in the official language of the destination of travel or in English language.
The detailed scope of information regarding the provision of services via the Booking System is provided within Annex No. 1 to these Terms and Conditions.
The detailed scope of information regarding the provision of services via the Call Center is provided within Annex No. 4 to these Terms and Conditions.
The User for whom services are specified in this paragraph of the Terms is protected against the insolvency of the tour operator on the terms set out in Annex No. 1 and 4 to these Terms and Conditions.
Indicated in the Booking System or through the Call Center price for services under this paragraph of the Terms includes the price of the travel package including taxes and, if necessary, any additional fees and other costs or - if it cannot reasonably be expected that these costs will be calculated before conclusion of the Agreement - information on the type of additional costs that the User may be charged with.

passenger transport prices resulting from changes in the cost of fuel or other power sources;
the amount of taxes or fees from services covered by the agreement for participation in package travel, imposed by entities that do not participate directly in the implementation of the package travel, including tourist taxes, airport charges or fees for boarding and disembarkation in ports and on airports;
exchange rates relevant for a given package travel

The User may withdraw from the travel package contract at any time before its commencement. However, the User will be required to pay an appropriate fee justified by the actual costs incurred in organising the travel package. If the travel package contract f does not specify any withdrawal fees f, the amount of this feel must correspond to the price of the travel package minus the saved costs or revenue from alternative tourist services. The refund will depend on the Service Provider’s cancellation policies. At the traveller's request, the tour operator must provide proof of the withdrawal fee amount for participation in the travel package contract. The User may cancel the Flight+Hotel Package only in its entirety. Cancelling one of the components of the Package will result in a cancellation of the whole booking and its remaining components.
The agreement for participation in package travel may indicate a fee for withdrawal from the Agreement in the amount depending on the time when withdrawn from the Agreement has been made before the start of the package travel, from the expected cost savings and expected income from the alternative use of the travel services concerned. The fee is subject to a deduction from the payment made by the traveler.
The User may withdraw the Agreement before the start of the package travel without incurring additional fee in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances occurring at the destination or its immediate vicinity, which have a significant impact on the implementation of the package travel or carriage of travelers to the destination. The User may only request reimbursement of payments made for the package travel, without compensation or redress in this regard.
The tour operator is entitled to unilaterally make minor changes to the terms and conditions of the Agreement after informing the User in advance. Other changes that can be made before the start of the travel package, including changing the main elements of the tourist services, the inability to meet special requirements, or increasing the price exceeding 8% of the total price of the travel package, are implemented after immediately informing the User and presenting available substitute services and the rules for their implementation.

As part of the services covered by this paragraph of the Terms, the User may, without the consent of the tour operator, transfer to the person fulfilling the conditions of participation in the package travel all entitlements due to him regarding the participation of such package travel, if at the same time the person assumes all obligations resulting from this Agreement and if the User will inform the tour operator about this within a reasonable time and on durable information medium. If the transfer of rights and the assumption of duties entails additional costs for the tour operator, the tour operator is obliged to show them to the traveler when requesting payment, e.g. the costs of changing the User's data. These costs must be reasonable and must not exceed the actual costs incurred by the tour operator as a result of the transfer of the travel package. Notifications submitted no later than 7 days before the start of the package travel shall in any case be deemed to have been filed within a reasonable time.

Flight changes without a service fee
- changes are made via the User Service Centre indicated in the Reservation System. The User is exempt from service fees charged by eSky for individual additional services, as indicated in the Service Fees Table and included in the scope of the purchased Support Package. In a situation where the airline or Supplier, in accordance with their tariff conditions, charges a fee for changes/refunds/special services, the User is obliged to pay this fee additionally.
AirHelp - assistance in obtaining compensation for a flight

Failure to supply contact details, providing data for online check-in less than 48 hours before the planned departure, supplying out-of-date or incomplete details, failure to answer phone calls from eSky or supplying incorrect details required for check-in may make it impossible to proceed with the online check-in and the User may incur additional charges at the airport defined by the airline or it may be impossible for them to depart.

destination
type of stay: short break, citybreak (2-4 days), holiday (5-14 days)

Booking terms and conditions, including liability and guarantee issues concerning hotel services provided by Suppliers  are subject to the terms and conditions specified in the order and in accordance with their regulations – e.g.
https://developer.ean.com/terms/en/

Depending on the choice of the services of a particular Supplier, a hotel service is booked through the Booking System simultaneously with the User making payment, within the deadlines resulting from the offer of the given facility, directly to the Supplier offering the facility, without payment to eSky (payment in the hotel or in the manner indicated by the Supplier) or by means of payment made available by eSky.
Types of booking:
Booking with eSky under the terms and conditions specified by Suppliers or under the terms and conditions specified by eSky, where eSky is responsible for the transfer of booking confirmations, payment processing and after-sales correspondence.
