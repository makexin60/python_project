Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains the practices and policies of G Cloud (“G Cloud”) regarding the collection and protection of Personal Data supplied by users or collected by us from users of G Cloud websites, including gcloudbackup.com, gcloudbackup.com, and the G Cloud and G Cloud backup services (the “Service”).
G Cloud defines “Personal Data” as any data from which it is practical to directly determine the identity of an individual. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in the Service’s License and Product Agreement (the “User Agreement”). This Privacy Policy may be updated by G Cloud from time to time. genie9 will provide notice of materially significant changes to the Privacy Policy by posting a notice on its websites.
By registering to use the Service, you agree (1) to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and (2) G Cloud may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy or the User Agreement. Personal Data may be processed by genie9 in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent.
Personal Data
Once you register with G Cloud and sign in to the Service, you are not anonymous to G Cloud.
When registering with G Cloud, you provide Personal Data, which may include company name, industry, number of employees, phone number, your title, city, state, country, zip code, a username, and a confirmed email address. When backing data up with the Service, you send us that data and you also are sending file system information, including names of files and directories. genie9 may also record your IP address when you submit information.
G Cloud also may collect, at your option, certain preference and demographic information from you.
All information collected by G Cloud is used for internal purposes of providing the Service, providing support to users, and to improve services. Aggregating non-identifying information supplied by users allows genie9 to understand its user base and to improve services.
G Cloud. may also use your company name, logo, and feedback for marketing purposes. For example, G Cloud. may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in our products or services and to send you information regarding G Cloud. and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.
To protect your account information, please keep your password secure.
All Users may opt to remove their Personal Data from our live database by contacting G Cloud and canceling their G Cloud user account. Users of the genie9.com Services may also cancel their user account by logging into their account, selecting My Account, and clicking on Delete Account or request from the person who added that person to the account for removal.
G Cloud does not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13.
We will not sell or market the email addresses or other collected personal information of registered Users to third parties.
We will not view the files that you backup, this includes, but is not limited to your call logs, contacts and SMS backed up from the apps. Data is stored in our data centers for your backup purposes only, and you only can view them when you restore.
