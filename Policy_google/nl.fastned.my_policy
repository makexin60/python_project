If you want to fast charge your electric vehicle you can register with Fastned by creating a Fastned account. You can create your Fastned account through the Fastned app (“Fastned App”). When creating your Fastned account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data such as name, telephone number, e-mail address, registration number (optional) and/or address and/or bank or charge card information (optional). You may always modify the above-mentioned data yourself in the Fastned App or ask us to modify or delete your data. Fastned shall store personal data for no longer than is necessary for the realisation of the purposes for which they are collected and processed. You can also withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account or asking us to delete your account.
If you have registered with Fastned, Fastned may send you messages in various ways, for example via email, via text messages and via push notifications within the App. The text message service and/or email may be used for verification for your account or for sharing important information regarding your charging session or account. You can also opt-in to receive the Fastned newsletter. If you no longer wish to receive the newsletter, you can easily unsubscribe from any future sends by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the footer of the email.
Do you prefer not to provide us with your personal data? You can also charge at Fastned without registering; in this case you pay for a one-off charging session with a credit or debit card, or with your charge card. Please see paragraph 3 for more information.

To make full use of all the functionalities of the Fastned App, it is recommended to switch on the Fastned App location service. This allows the use of GPS data and locations of WiFi hotspots and telephone masts to determine your approximate location, in order to assess which Fastned fast charging station is closest to you. Fastned may store and process these data regarding locations to improve our services. We may also ask you for access to your camera when you want to share a photo, for example when you want to send us feedback. We will always ask you for specific access to your location service or your camera and you may refuse this at all times. Sharing location services is therefore not mandatory, but it is convenient.

Payment by debit- or credit card with a Fastned account When you add your payment method in the App, you will have to provide the necessary data for the chosen payment method (such as name and card number). These data will be directly captured by our payment service provider Adyen.
One-off payment by debit- or credit card without registration
It is also possible to pay for a one-off charging session without registration or account. For these payments your credit, debit or bank account information (such as expiry date and type of card) and other financial information required for your payment will be collected and stored by our payment service provider Adyen. Fastned does not process any personal data .
One-off payment by payment terminal
If available at the charging station, it is also possible to pay for a one-off charging session via a payment terminal. For these payments, your card details (name, account number, CV, expiry and start date) are processed by our payment service provider, Elavon.
Payment by charge card
When using a charge card, the costs incurred will be invoiced via the charge card company. Fastned receives a so-called RFID code from the charge card company that issued your charge card, on the basis of which Fastned can send an invoice to the charge card company for the electricity charged.

When you start a charging session, your vehicle communicates its unique ID (MAC-address) to the charger. If you decide to activate Autocharge in the App, your vehicle’s MAC-address is hashed and stored with your other account details. From then on, all sessions started through Autocharge will be billed to your account’s default payment method. If you decide not to activate Autocharge your MAC-address won’t be stored with your account details.
Additionally, to analyse, optimise and secure our charging services, all MAC-addresses, after they have been hashed, are stored together with the session information (e.g. number of charged kWh and session time). This will not be linked to account details.

If you respond to a vacancy on our Website, we ask for your details, including your resume. We use these details to evaluate your application and possibly to contact you. We use a third party (software) applicant tracking system, namely Recruitee, for the processing of responses to our vacancies on our Website. We will keep your personal data only for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or processed, unless we have to keep it for tax or legal reasons. In practice, this means that if you are hired, the information related to your job application will end up in your personnel file. If you are not hired, we willl keep your information on file for a maximum of 12 months so that you can be considered for other vacancies. If you do not want us to keep your information for this period of time, you can click on the link that you’ve received in the confirmation email of your original application. This link will direct you to the Recruitee environment where you can request a complete data removal. Alternatively, you can send a request for data removal to recruitment@fastned.nl.
You can withdraw your permission for your application at any time by sending an email to recruitment@fastned.nl. In this case, we will not process your application any further.

For the purpose of your own safety, the surveillance of our property, prevention and registration of nuisance, vandalism and other criminal offences, Fastned has installed camera surveillance at its charging stations. The camera surveillance is indicated on notice boards at the boundaries of the areas covered by the cameras, by hanging the cameras in a clearly visible position, and by other clearly recognisable means if the situation so requires. Fastned shall never store the images longer than necessary and/or legally allowed.
A person recorded on camera images may access the images on which (s)he is identifiable, provided that the images have not yet been deleted due to their retention period. A person recorded on camera images may receive a copy of these images by submitting a request, in writing or by electronic means, to Fastned. A request for access or extraction of a copy requires proof of identity and a clear indication of the time period during which the data subject is suspected to have been recorded.

For the performance of our business activities and depending on the services we provide to you, we may share your personal data with external parties (so-called processors) who carry out specific tasks at the request of Fastned. These third parties process your personal data exclusively on behalf of Fastned. The processing performed by these third parties is subject to so-called data processing agreements, in which Fastned has ensured that the service provider will only process personal data in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation and Fastned’s instructions. This includes the following parties:
External hosting providers, including cloud providers for the storage and management of your data;
External parties with applications and/or software in the areas of customer service, recruitment, email marketing, product and service analysis, survey services, tool sets for our Fastned App;

Transmission outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and/or Switzerland
Some of our service providers are established in a country outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, for example the United States. In order to comply with EU data protection laws on international transfers, we carefully consider whether an adequate level of protection can be provided. Where necessary, we lay down arrangements in a transfer agreement based on standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission (Article 46(2)(c) of the GDPR).
