It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies we do not own or control, or to individuals we do not employ or manage.
Collection of Personal Information
We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, make a purchase, or fill in any online forms in the Mobile Application. When required, this information may include your email address, name or other Personal Information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may be unable to take advantage of some of the Mobile Application’s features.
Collection of Non-Personal Information
When you open the Mobile Application, our servers automatically record information that your device sends. This data may include information such as your device’s IP address and location, device name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, information you search for in our Mobile Application, access times and dates, and other statistics.
Use of Collected Information
Any of the information we collect from you may be used to: improve customer service and respond to queries and emails of our customers; process transactions; send notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc; or run and operate our Mobile Application and Services. We use this information with your consent, and to deliver to you any contractual services you may have requested, such as access to our products and services. Non-personal information collected is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Mobile Application traffic and usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.
Billing and Payments
We use third-party payment processors to assist us in processing your payment information securely. Such third-party processors’ use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies, which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Privacy Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.
Children
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through our Mobile Application or Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through our Mobile Application or Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us through our Mobile Application or Service, please contact us. If you are a minor and do not understand anything within this Privacy Policy as to how your personal data will be kept, stored, and used, please do not hesitate to contact us with questions.
Newsletters
We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However, you will continue to receive essential transactional emails. Your personal email information is used by way of your consent to these newsletters, and by way of contractual requirements for any transactional emails, like receipts, or service notices, etc.
Information Security
We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorised access, use, modification, and disclosure of personal information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet that are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and our Mobile Application cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered within transit by a third party, despite best efforts. We have an obligation to contact and notify you in the event of data breach, and we will adhere with this obligation to contact you in the unlikely event that such a breach should occur.
Data Breach
In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application has been compromised or users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make immediate efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach within the time period stipulated by law, and we will take all steps possible to limit the scope of the breach, and lessen its impact, and we will abide by all government regulations with respect to notifications of this.
Legal Disclosure
We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or court order, or similar legal process or to respond to any complaint or claim, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. In the event of a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account and personal data will likely be among the assets transferred, but you will be made aware of this prior to transfer and will have the opportunity to decline any such transfer.
Changes and Amendments
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy relating to the Mobile Application or Services at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Policy in the Mobile Application. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. Continued use of the Mobile Application after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.
Your Rights
You have the right to request a copy of any personal information we hold on you, and we will comply with any such request within a reasonable period of time, or within the time period dictated by law. You may also request us to delete your personal information, or to restrict its transfer or processing at any time, and we will do our best to comply with such requests. Where such a request would render a contract you otherwise have agreed with us for the supply of a product or service, then the implications of cancellation will be made aware to you at the time of you requesting such deletion. You are entitled to notify us to exclude you from any marketing emails or other promotional messages.
Acceptance of This Policy
You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By using the Mobile Application or its Services, you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorised to use or access the Mobile Application and its Services.
