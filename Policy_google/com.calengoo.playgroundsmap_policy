Terms and Privacy Policy
Overview
Playgrounds is an app to view playgrounds that are retrieved from
OpenStreetMap
and displayed on a

map. You can make contributions (descriptions of playgrounds, comments, ratings and images) and these will be
publicly visible
afterward, i.e. other users of the app can see your contributions. However playgrounds does not know who you are, so the contributions are anonymous as long as you don’t enter any personal information (which you should not do).

The use of Google Maps is in the interest of making our website appealing and to facilitate the location of places specified by us on the website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.
