LGPD Notice (Brazil)
​
Brazil's new privacy legislation, the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) was approved on 14th August 2018 and is expected to come into effect on May 3, 2021 as per the terms of the Provisional Measure No. 959, which remains pending of analyses by the National Congress. If the Provisional Measure is not approved, amended or analyzed by the scheduled deadline, the LGPD will become effective on August 15, 2020.
Due to the fact that the LGPD is similar to the GDPR in many ways (despite some differences), we believe that we are in a good position to achieve full compliance with the provisions of the LGPD before it enters into force, including without limitations, allowing all data subjects which personal data will be protected under the provisions of the LGPD to exercise their rights, including the right to request that personal data will be erased, the right to data portability and data access.
In performing personal data processing which is subject to the LGPD, we will adhere to key differences between the LGPD and other legislation acts such as the GDPR, among others with respect to the required procedures for reporting a data breach, the legal basis available to us for the collection, processing and sharing of personal data, the various rights of data subjects, etc.
We may, at our discretion, decide to implement data protection principles, procedures and processes which are more protective to you than is required from us by the applicable privacy data legislation. For example, we may decide to follow the GDPR data breach reporting obligations which are stricter than the requirement under the LGPD. In no event shall our decision to follow such stricter policies grant you any rights which are not granted to you under the data protection legislation applicable to you.
​
