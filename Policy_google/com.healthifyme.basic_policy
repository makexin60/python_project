PERSONAL DATA: We may collect and process ‘special categories of personal data’ such as
        ethnic origin, genetics, health or sexual orientation, which are
        considered sensitive. We use this special category of personal data, for
        example to provide specialized diet plan and exercise routines. We

        of personal data. You may refuse or revoke your consent at any time,
        please see the section about 'Your Rights & Preferences As A Data
        Subject In The EU' below. A limited number of our personnel will have
        access to special categories of personal data provided by you.
FOOD PHOTOS - SNAP:
With your prior consent, the following activities may be undertaken with respect to your Food Photos:
FILTERING: The Food Photos will be analyzed on your device (i.e., without storing them on our servers) to check the type of data contained therein. Using our technology, we will, to the extent possible, blur any and all contents other than food.
STORAGE: Thereafter, such Food Photos will be stored in our servers to help you track your nutrition and achieve your health goals. When you give us permission to access your photo gallery, we will only collect and store the Food Photos you choose to track on our App. We will not upload any other photos or data from your device. To provide more nuance, we would like to clarify that the decision to classify photos as food or non-food is made by algorithms, not through human review. Furthermore, this algorithm operates solely on the device, and no photo is transferred to our server unless the algorithm determines that it is a food photo. It is important to understand that the algorithm may occasionally misclassify non-food photos as food photos. While we are constantly reviewing and improving our code to reduce such occurrences, there is still a chance that your photo may be uploaded even if it is not a food photo. If you are registered with us and intend to use the ‘auto-snap’ feature, please note that you can decide if we can access the photos in your gallery, and we're open about how we use them.
UTILIZATION. We analyse the Food Photos you choose to track using our proprietary technology to determine the nutritional content of your meals. We do not share your information with any third parties.
DATA SECURITY: We take the security of the Food Photos seriously and have implemented industry-standard security measures to protect such data from unauthorized access or disclosure. All data is encrypted and stored on secure servers that are regularly monitored and updated.
DATA RETENTION: We keep your Food Photos as needed, then delete them. You could choose to remove them manually if so desired.
CONSENT: If no consent is provided by you, we will not analyze or collect any Food Photos. You will still be able to avail of the other functionalities of our App.
