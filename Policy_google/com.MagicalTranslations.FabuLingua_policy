Children’s Privacy
Compliance with COPPA
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, “COPPA”) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (“parents”) about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13 (“children”). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information. We take our obligations under COPPA very seriously and are committed to protecting children’s privacy.

Information We Collect from Children
Children can access many parts of the Site and App and use many of their features without providing us with personal information. However, some content and features require us to collect certain information from them.
