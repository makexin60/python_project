6. Protecting your personal data
We strive to use commercially reasonable industry
            standards efforts to protect the confidentiality of your personal
            data that is in our possession or under our control, eg. taking
            appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access,
            collection, use, disclosure, copying modification, disposal or
            similar risks in relation to such personal data.
However, you should be aware that no data transmission
            over the internet or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed
            as totally secure and therefore, unfortunately, we cannot ensure or
            warrant the total security of any information stored or transmitted
            from or to our online products or Services. Any such transmission is
            at your own risk. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to
            protect the security of your data and regularly review developments
            in relation to security and encryption technologies.
7. Accuracy of personal data
We will take reasonable efforts to ensure that your
            personal data is accurate and complete (as provided by you or your
            Organisation) when we disclose it to our partners and if we disclose
            it to other third parties in accordance with this Policy or if it is
            likely to be used by us to make a decision affecting you.
Please note that, in most circumstances, we will presume
            that personal data directly provided from you or your Organisation
            will be current, accurate and complete. However, depending on the
            circumstances, we may decide to contact you to ensure that this is
            the case or to ask that you verify that the personal data we hold in
            relation to you is up to date.
8. How you can access and amend your personal information
You may access, review and amend your personal
            information at any time by signing into your user account (where
            applicable) and selecting “Update Profile” (or equivalent), or by
            contacting our Support Helpdesk.
9. Retention of personal data
We will only hold your personal data for as long as required
            for the purposes for which it was collected or as required or
            permitted by law.
We will review and assess whether
            personal data can legitimately be retained, having regard to the
            purpose for which it was collected and any other legal or business
            purposes for which retention may be necessary. Where we are
            satisfied that we no longer need to retain your personal data, we
            will take prompt action to ensure that we will no longer hold on to
            it, either by destroying or removing your personal data from our
            systems, files and other records completely and permanently or by
            removing any identifying information so that it becomes anonymised.
10. Legal basis for processing personal information
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal
            information described above will depend on the personal information
            concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information
            from you only
(i) where we need the personal information to
            perform a contract with you;
(ii) where the processing is in
            our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; or
(iii)
            where we have your consent to do so. We have a legitimate interest
            in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to
            provide these Services, for example when responding to your queries,
            improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes
            of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
In some
            cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
            information from you or may otherwise need the personal information
            to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If
            we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
            requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this
            clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of
            your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the
            possible consequences if you do not provide your personal
            information).
11. Your data protection rights under the general Data Protection
              Regulation (GDPR)
If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the
            following data protection rights :
(i) If you wish to access,
            correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information,
            you can do so at any time by emailing us.
(ii) In addition,
            you can object to the processing of your personal information, ask
            us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or
            request portability of your personal information. Again, you can
            exercise these rights by emailing us.
(iii) You have the right
            to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You
            can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or
            “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you. To opt-out of
            other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing us.
(iv) Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal
            information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at
            any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of
            any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it
            affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
            reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
(v)
            You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about
            our collection and use of your personal information. For more
            information, please contact your local data protection authority.
(vi) We respond to all requests we receive from individuals
            wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with
            applicable data protection laws.

You can use some of the features of the Services without providing
            all your personal information, thereby limiting the type of
            information that we collect.
You may unsubscribe from
            receiving certain promotional emails from us. If you wish to do so,
            simply follow the instructions found at the end of the email. Even
            if you unsubscribe, we may still contact you for informational,
            transactional, account-related, or similar purposes.
Many browsers have an option for disabling cookies,
            which may prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or enable
            selective use of cookies. Please note that, if you choose not to
            accept cookies, some features and the personalization of our
            Services may no longer work for you. You will continue to receive
            advertising material but it will not be tailored to your interests.
Our mobile applications may also send push notifications
            to your mobile device, provided you consented to this. If you have
            previously consented to receiving push notifications and no longer
            wish to receive them, you can also turn push notifications off at
            the device level.
13. International Data Transfer
OAS is a global business. We may transfer personal
            information to countries other than the country in which the data
            was originally collected. These countries may not have the same data
            protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the
            information. When we transfer your personal information to other
            countries, we will protect that information as described in this
            Privacy Policy.
