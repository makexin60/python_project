                    of the appropriate redemption transactions. If you feel that your account was not credited or
                    debited correctly or reflects incorrect redemption transactions, please send an email to
customerservice@gobranded.com

                    should include the Panel member’s name, email address and specific information on the subject

                    and/or delete information contained in his or her membership profile by: (i) accessing his or her

                    or contact lists for the applicable Panel; during which period the member may receive communications

Dynata hereby reserves the right, in Dynata’s sole discretion, to make changes to these Terms.
                    Dynata encourages you to review these Terms on an ongoing basis. Dynata will obtain your consent
                    prior to changes that are of such nature that consent is needed or required. For changes that do not
                    require consent, your continued use of, access to, and/or participation in the Applications/Services
                    does and will to constitute your acceptance of these Terms as amended.
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Dynata and its parent, affiliated and subsidiary
                    companies and its and their respective members, managers, shareholders, directors, officers,
                    employees and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, judgments, awards,
                    fines, penalties and costs and/or expenses of any kind, including, but not limited to, reasonable
                    attorneys’ fees and court costs, arising out of, resulting from or caused, either directly or

                    in, and/or access to the Applications/Services.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL
                    Dynata BE LIABLE OR OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
                    CONSEQUENTIAL AND/OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, FOR ANY REASON(S) OR FOR ANY CAUSE(S), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
                    DYNATA IS INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH DAMAGES MAY EXIST.
ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE APPLICATIONS/SERVICES AND/OR
                    THESE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.
You acknowledge and agree that you will comply with all applicable international, national, Federal,
                    state and/or local laws, codes, regulations, rules
                    and/or requirements ("
Applicable Laws
") regarding your use of, participation, in, and/or access to the
                    Applications/Services.
Either party may terminate your membership with a Panel at any time, with or without cause, for any
                    reason or for no reason, and without liability for the termination.
In addition to any and all other available remedies, Dynata may, without notice, suspend and/or
                    terminate your use of, access to, and/or participation in the Applications/Services if you are in
                    breach or violation of these Terms. If Dynata terminates your membership due to your breach or
                    violation of these Terms: (i) you forfeit all rights, title and interest in and/or to all unredeemed
                    rewards, incentives and/or prizes, effective immediately upon termination; (ii) your membership will
                    immediately be cancelled; and (iii) your access to, participation in and use of the
                    Applications/Services (including, but not limited to, participation in survey projects) will
                    immediately cease.
In the event that a non-Panel member breaches or otherwise violates these Terms, such non-Panel
                    member hereby agrees that: (a) all rights, title and interest in and/or to all unredeemed rewards,
                    incentives and/or prizes (if any), shall be forfeit effective immediately upon termination; and (b)
                    access to, use of, and participation in the Applications/Services will immediately cease.
In addition, Dynata reserves the right to de-activate your Panel membership account: (a) if your
                    membership account does not remain Active (as defined herein); (b) if Dynata receives a hard bounce
                    or delivery failure notice in regards to email communications sent by Dynata to your email account;
                    or (c) if Dynata receives a “mailbox full” reply notice three (3) times in regards to email
                    communications sent by Dynata to your email account. For the purpose of these Terms,
                    “
Active
” means that you: (i) participate in a survey at least once every six (6)
                    months; or (ii) update your profile or member information at least once every six (6) months.
In the event of deactivation, termination by you or termination by Dynata (other than for your
                    breach or violation of these Terms), Dynata shall maintain a record of the posted, unredeemed
                    rewards, incentives and/or prizes and, subject to the applicable minimum redemption thresholds,
                    shall allow you to redeem such rewards, incentives and/or prizes for a period of thirty (30) days
                    following the effective date of termination or deactivation of your account.
                    Termination or deactivation of your membership will not delete or remove any application(s).
A.
Restriction.
Dynata employees and their
                    Immediate Family Member(s) (as defined herein) are not eligible to receive any payments, prizes or
                    incentives for using, participating in or accessing the Applications/Services. For the purpose of
                    this Section 19, the term “
Immediate Family Member(s)
” includes parents, spouses,
                    children or significant others (i.e. girlfriends/boyfriends, domestic partners and spousal
                    equivalents).
B.
Procedures
. Dynata’s employees may use, access
                    or participate in the Applications/Services only after receiving written permission from their
                    respective manager, and only for the sole purpose of improving Dynata’s products and/or services.
                    Dynata’s employees must always be honest and report accurate information in connection with using,
                    accessing or participating in the Applications/Services. If altered, false, or untrue information or
                    data must be used, prior consent and approval must be received from Dynata’s Chief Executive
                    Officer.
C.
Improper Conduct.
Unless authorized pursuant to
                    these Terms or otherwise approved in writing by Dynata’s Chief Executive Officer, the violation of
                    the terms of this Section 19 by a Dynata employee and/or hos/her Immediate Family Member(s) is a
                    violation of Dynata’s standards of conduct and any such violation may subject the employee to
                    discipline, including, but not limited to, termination of employment.
A.

                    date the e-mail was sent, provided that Dynata did not receive an error message stating that
                    delivery of the e-mail was delayed, that the e-mail address was invalid or that the e-mail otherwise
                    could not be delivered); (ii) by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid addressed

C.
Legal Notice.
All questions regarding these
                    Terms and all legal notices should be sent, in accordance with Section 20.A. of these Terms, to:
Dynata, LLC
4 Research Drive
Suite 300

If any term or provision of these Terms shall be held or declared to be invalid or unenforceable for
                    any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such term or provision shall be deemed null and
                    void and shall not affect the application and/or interpretation of these Terms. The remaining terms
                    or provisions of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect, as if the invalid or
                    unenforceable term or provision was not a part of these Terms.
All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth
                    below) in connection with the Terms, use of any product or service provided by Dynata, or related to
                    the processing of personal data, that cannot be resolved informally or on an individual basis in
                    small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms
                    of this Section 22 (this “
Arbitration Agreement
”). Unless otherwise agreed, all
                    arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and
                    Dynata, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
                    successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
                    services or goods provided under the Terms.
Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written
                    Notice of Dispute (“
Notice
”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or
                    dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Dynata should be sent to: 4 Research Drive, Suite
                    300, Shelton, Connecticut 06484 USA; ATTN: Arbitration Notice. After the Notice is received, you and
                    Dynata may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Dynata do not resolve the
                    claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
                    arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to
                    the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
                    either party is entitled.
Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
                    (“
JAMS
”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“
ADR
                        Provider
”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not
                    available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of
                    the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
                    method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
                    with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the “
JAMS Rules
”) governing
                    the arbitration are available online at https://www.jamsadr.com/. The arbitration shall be conducted
                    by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
                    is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
                    non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes
                    where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
                    right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a
                    location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
                    unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
                    parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
                    award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party
                    shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the
                    arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone,
                    online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
                    initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties
                    or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
If you or Dynata pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within
                    the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline
                    imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.
If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
                    and Dynata, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
                    cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
                    part of any claim (including any claim regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement or
                    any unconscionability in connection with these Terms). The arbitrator shall have the authority to
                    award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
                    under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
                    statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
                    including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
                    relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
                    is final and binding upon you and Dynata.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL
                    IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
                    arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited,
                    more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited
                    review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dynata in any state or
                    federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
                    WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR
                    LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR
                    USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
                    USER.
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator
                    and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
                    confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from
                    submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
                    arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. If any part or parts of this
                    Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable with regards to any
                    particular subject matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts
                    shall be of no force and effect with regard to such specific subject matter and shall be severed and
                    the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by
                    the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
                    portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Dynata.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Dynata may bring an individual action in small claims

21. Severability
If any term or provision of these Terms shall be held or declared to be invalid or unenforceable for
						any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such term or provision shall be deemed null and
						void and shall not affect the application and/or interpretation of these Terms. The remaining terms
						or provisions of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect, as if the invalid or
						unenforceable term or provision was not a part of these Terms.
22. Arbitration Agreement (United States only)
All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth
						below) in connection with the Terms, use of any product or service provided by Dynata, or related to
						the processing of personal data, that cannot be resolved informally or on an individual basis in
						small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms
						of this Section 22 (this “
Arbitration Agreement
”). Unless otherwise agreed, all
						arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and
						Dynata, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
						successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
						services or goods provided under the Terms.
Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written
						Notice of Dispute (“
Notice
”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or
						dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Dynata should be sent to: 4 Research Drive, Suite
						300, Shelton, Connecticut 06484 USA; ATTN: Arbitration Notice. After the Notice is received, you and
						Dynata may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Dynata do not resolve the
						claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
						arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to
						the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
						either party is entitled.
Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
						(“
JAMS
”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“
ADR
                        Provider
”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not
						available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of
						the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
						method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
						with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the “
JAMS Rules
”) governing
						the arbitration are available online at
https://www.jamsadr.com/
. The arbitration shall be conducted
						by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
						is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
						non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes
						where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
						right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a
						location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
						unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
						parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
						award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party
						shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the
						arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone,
						online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
						initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties
						or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
If you or Dynata pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within
						the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline
						imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.
If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
						and Dynata, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
						cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
						part of any claim (including any claim regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement or
						any unconscionability in connection with these Terms). The arbitrator shall have the authority to
						award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
						under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
						statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
						including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
						relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
						is final and binding upon you and Dynata.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL
						IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
						arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited,
						more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited
						review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dynata in any state or
						federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
						WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR
						LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR
						USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
						USER.
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator
						and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
						confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from
						submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
						arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. If any part or parts of this
						Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable with regards to any
						particular subject matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts
						shall be of no force and effect with regard to such specific subject matter and shall be severed and
						the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by
						the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
						portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Dynata.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Dynata may bring an individual action in small claims court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
						federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim
						measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration
						Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
						and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade
						secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in
						court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within
						Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA for such purpose.
23. Governing Laws; Jurisdiction and Venue
These Terms and your access to, use of or participation in the Applications/Services shall be
						governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Connecticut, USA, without
						regard to any portion of any choice of law principles (whether those of Connecticut or any other
						jurisdiction) that might provide for application of a different jurisdiction’s laws. All claims or
						disputes arising in connection with these Terms and/or your access to, use of or participation in
						the Applications/Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or Federal
						courts located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA.
24. Miscellaneous Terms
The headings contained in these Terms are for reference only and shall have no effect on the
						interpretation and/or application of these Terms. Dynata’s failure to enforce a breach by you of
						these Terms shall not waive or release you from such breach and shall not waive, release or prevent
						Dynata from enforcing any subsequent breach by you of these Terms. These Terms and any rules, terms
						or policies referenced herein or incorporated herein, and any Panel-specific requirements, represent
						the entire understanding and agreement between Dynata and you with respect to the subject matter
						hereof.

                    conditions for rewards, incentives and prize draws or sweepstakes may be available in these Terms,
                    on the Website for a Panel, at the beginning or end of a survey, in survey invitations, on the
                    website(s) or webpage(s) for redeeming rewards, incentives, and prizes, and/or may be described in
                    any newsletter or other communication distributed or published by Dynata.
The various types of incentives and rewards Dynata may provide are to encourage participation in the
                    Panel and are not compensation for time spent. Any points or Panel Currency that is earned or paid
                    to you or any reward that is redeemed by you for participation in the Research or other activity on
                    a Panel is not calculated based on time spent by you. Similarly, any consideration paid to or points
                    earned by you for participation is not pro-rated on an hourly basis or otherwise.
B. All points or Panel Currency posted to a Panel member’s account expire one (1) year following
                    posting, unless the points or Panel Currency are forfeited or canceled earlier due to membership or
                    account inactivity or as otherwise set forth in these Terms. Panel member accounts are not actual
                    bank or financial accounts and do not accrue or accumulate interest of any kind.
C. Points or Panel Currency posted in connection with the Applications/Services do not constitute
                    property of the Panel member, cannot be transferred during or after the Panel member’s life, by
                    operation of law or otherwise, and have no value until presented by the Panel member for redemption
                    in accordance with these Terms.
D. In the event that any points, Panel Currency, or incentive have been erroneously posted to a
                    Panel member’s account, Dynata may remove them from the Panel member’s account.
E. In the event that any points, Panel Currency, or incentive have been obtained and/or posted to a
                    Panel member’s account through fraudulent means, Dynata will remove them from the Panel member’s
                    account and the account may be suspended and/or terminated.
F. Redemption
(1) Points or Panel Currency will be deducted from the Panel member's account at the time the
                    redemption request is made.
(2) All redemptions are final, and rewards may not be returned for credit except as otherwise
                    provided in these Terms or as otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of
                    Dynata.
(3) The minimum points or Panel Currency redemption threshold required to redeem a reward is the
                    equivalent of Fifty United States Dollars ($50). Unless there is a lower redemption option
                    available, if you do not satisfy the foregoing threshold, you will not have a redemption option
                    under Dynata’s rewards program. Dynata reserves the right to provide reward options with lower
                    minimum redemption thresholds without prior notice to or consent from you.
(4) Dynata has engaged and from time-to-time will engage certain third party ID verification service providers, listed here:
Veriff
in connection with the redemption process. In order to redeem rewards, you may be asked to verify your identity through our third party ID verification service provider's platform. In all cases, such service providers shall be subject to appropriate agreements concerning data processing, confidentiality, etc.
G. Dynata may modify, alter, delete or add new terms and conditions for its rewards program or the
                    Applications/Services at any time without notice. For Dynata this includes, but is not limited to,
                    modifying, altering, adding or deleting point values, redemption levels, conversion ratios,
                    conditions for status, conditions for membership and conditions for earning incentives or rewards,
                    at any time without notice. In addition, Dynata may terminate or cease offering any incentive or
                    reward in connection with Dynata’s rewards program, at any time without notice.
H. You may not combine your points or Panel Currency with points or Panel Currency belonging to any
                    other member, including, but not limited to, any family member or friend.
I. Dynata make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding any
                    product or service received in connection with Dynata’s rewards program, including, but not limited
                    to, any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Dynata is not, and will not
                    be, liable or responsible for the performance of, or for the failure of the performance of, any
                    product or service for which points or Panel Currency, incentives or rewards are redeemed. In
                    addition, Dynata is not and will not be responsible or liable for any cost, damage, accident, delay,
                    injury, loss, expense or inconvenience that may arise in connection with the use of, or defect in,
                    any product or service for which points, Panel Currency, incentives or rewards are redeemed. Dynata
                    will not replace any lost, stolen, misplaced or damaged incentives or rewards.
J. YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE POINTS, PANEL CURRENCY, INCENTIVES OR REWARDS
                    EARNED THROUGH THE APPLICATIONS/SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO TAX, WHICH IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF
                    THE PANEL MEMBER. Dynata may provide you and/or the appropriate government agency or taxing
                    authority with information related to any payments or incentives you earn in connection with your
                    use of the Applications/Services. You agree to provide Dynata with all required information to
                    assist Dynata in complying with its reporting or withholding obligations. Dynata may withhold any
                    tax from any incentive or reward as required by applicable law.
K. Dynata uses reasonable efforts to ensure that points or Panel Currency are credited and debited
                    appropriately; however, the Panel member should review their account to ensure that their account
                    correctly identifies the posted points or Panel Currency, incentives, or rewards, and reflects all
                    of the appropriate redemption transactions. If you feel that your account was not credited or
                    debited correctly or reflects incorrect redemption transactions, please send an email to
customerservice@gobranded.com
. Any email sent to Dynata
                    should include the Panel member’s name, email address and specific information on the subject
                    matter. Dynata will use reasonable efforts to investigate the matter and to respond back to the
                    Panel member promptly. Dynata's decision is final and binding.
L. The suppliers or providers of the products or services offered in connection with Dynata’s
                    rewards program and/or the owners or operators of the website(s)/webpage(s) on which redemption
                    transactions occur, may have their own terms and conditions; please review these terms and
                    conditions carefully.
M. Personal information may have to be collected, processed and/or disclosed in connection with
                    Dynata’s rewards program and/or any request to redeem a reward or incentive. By agreeing to these
                    Terms, you hereby agree to the collection, processing and/or disclosure of your personal information
                    for such purpose(s) and all such personal information shall be subject to the terms set forth in
                    Dynata’s Privacy Policy. Redemption of Virtual Mastercard® or Visa® may require verification of your
                    identity by the financial institution responsible for issuing your Virtual Mastercard® and Visa®,
                    and that such verification may require you to provide your date of birth, tax identification number,
                    and similar information.
N. If a Panel member elects to donate points or Panel Currency to one of the charities approved by
                    Dynata, Dynata will donate said points or Panel Currency to the selected charity. The donation is
                    not made by or on behalf of Dynata and Dynata does not and will not match any donation. Please note
                    that the donation option is not available on every panel owned and/or operated by or on behalf of
                    Dynata. Please check the redemption options available for the panel to which you belong.
O. Your daily limit on the redemption of points or Panel Currency is limited to two (2) redemptions
                    per 24-hour period.
P. In the United States, Dynata has an obligation to: (i) provide a W-9 tax form to individuals who
                    receive payments (whether via the redemption of points or Panel Currency or other means) of $600 or
                    more in a tax year; and (ii) file a 1099-Misc form with the United States Internal Revenue Service
                    (“IRS”) for such payments. In addition, Dynata will provide you with a completed 1099-Misc form for
                    your tax compliance purposes. As a result, please see the following:
(1) If you have received payments of $599 during a tax year, your account will be suspended (i.e., you will not be able to receive further payments and will not be able to complete or participate in surveys) for the remainder of the applicable tax year unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and
                    verified W-9 form.
(2) If you have received payments of $600 or more during a tax year, your account will be suspended indefinitely (i.e., you will not be able to receive further payments and will not be able to
                    complete or participate in surveys) unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and
                    verified W-9 form. In this case, your account will not be reinstated at the beginning of the next
                    tax year, unless or until you provide Dynata with a completed and verified W-9 form.
(3) You agree to provide Dynata with your then-current address information. You have the
                    responsibility to update Dynata
                    on any change of address and Dynata is not responsible for any misdirected
                    communication based on your failure to do so.

                    or contact lists for the applicable Panel; during which period the member may receive communications

Legal Notice.
All questions regarding these
                    Terms and all legal notices should be sent, in accordance with Section 20.A. of these Terms, to:

If any term or provision of these Terms shall be held or declared to be invalid or unenforceable for
                    any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such term or provision shall be deemed null and
                    void and shall not affect the application and/or interpretation of these Terms. The remaining terms
                    or provisions of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect, as if the invalid or
                    unenforceable term or provision was not a part of these Terms.
All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth
                    below) in connection with the Terms, use of any product or service provided by Dynata, or related to
                    the processing of personal data, that cannot be resolved informally or on an individual basis in
                    small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms
                    of this Section 22 (this “
Arbitration Agreement
”). Unless otherwise agreed, all
                    arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and
                    Dynata, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
                    successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
                    services or goods provided under the Terms.
Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written
                    Notice of Dispute (“
Notice
”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or
                    dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Dynata should be sent to: 4 Research Drive, Suite
                    300, Shelton, Connecticut 06484 USA; ATTN: Arbitration Notice. After the Notice is received, you and
                    Dynata may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Dynata do not resolve the
                    claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
                    arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to
                    the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
                    either party is entitled.
Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
                    (“
JAMS
”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“
ADR
                        Provider
”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not
                    available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of
                    the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
                    method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
                    with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the “
JAMS Rules
”) governing
                    the arbitration are available online at https://www.jamsadr.com/. The arbitration shall be conducted
                    by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
                    is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
                    non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes
                    where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
                    right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a
                    location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
                    unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
                    parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
                    award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party
                    shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the
                    arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone,
                    online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
                    initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties
                    or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
If you or Dynata pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within
                    the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline
                    imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.
If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
                    and Dynata, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
                    cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
                    part of any claim (including any claim regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement or
                    any unconscionability in connection with these Terms). The arbitrator shall have the authority to
                    award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
                    under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
                    statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
                    including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
                    relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
                    is final and binding upon you and Dynata.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL
                    IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
                    arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited,
                    more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited
                    review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dynata in any state or
                    federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
                    WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR
                    LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR
                    USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
                    USER.
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator
                    and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
                    confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from
                    submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
                    arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. If any part or parts of this
                    Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable with regards to any
                    particular subject matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts
                    shall be of no force and effect with regard to such specific subject matter and shall be severed and
                    the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by
                    the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
                    portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Dynata.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Dynata may bring an individual action in small claims
                    court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
                    federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim
                    measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration
                    Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
                    and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade
                    secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in
                    court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within
                    Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA for such purpose.
These Terms and your access to, use of or participation in the Applications/Services shall be
                    governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Connecticut, USA, without
                    regard to any portion of any choice of law principles (whether those of Connecticut or any other
                    jurisdiction) that might provide for application of a different jurisdiction’s laws. All claims or
                    disputes arising in connection with these Terms and/or your access to, use of or participation in
                    the Applications/Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or Federal
                    courts located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA.
The headings contained in these Terms are for reference only and shall have no effect on the
                    interpretation and/or application of these Terms. Dynata’s failure to enforce a breach by you of
                    these Terms shall not waive or release you from such breach and shall not waive, release or prevent
                    Dynata from enforcing any subsequent breach by you of these Terms. These Terms and any rules, terms
                    or policies referenced herein or incorporated herein, and any Panel-specific requirements, represent
                    the entire understanding and agreement between Dynata and you with respect to the subject matter
                    hereof.

						posting, unless the points or Panel Currency are forfeited or canceled earlier due to membership or
						account inactivity or as otherwise set forth in these Terms. Panel member accounts are not actual
						bank or financial accounts and do not accrue or accumulate interest of any kind.

						property of the Panel member, cannot be transferred during or after the Panel member’s life, by

						provided in these Terms or as otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of
						Dynata.

						equivalent of Fifty United States Dollars ($50). Unless there is a lower redemption option
						available, if you do not satisfy the foregoing threshold, you will not have a redemption option
						under Dynata’s rewards program. Dynata reserves the right to provide reward options with lower
						minimum redemption thresholds without prior notice to or consent from you.

						to verify your identity through our third party ID verification service provider's platform. In all cases, such service providers shall be subject to appropriate agreements concerning data processing, confidentiality, etc.
G. Dynata may modify, alter, delete or add new terms and conditions for its rewards program or the
						Applications/Services at any time without notice. For Dynata this includes, but is not limited to,
						modifying, altering, adding or deleting point values, redemption levels, conversion ratios,
						conditions for status, conditions for membership and conditions for earning incentives or rewards,
						at any time without notice. In addition, Dynata may terminate or cease offering any incentive or
						reward in connection with Dynata’s rewards program, at any time without notice.
H. You may not combine your points or Panel Currency with points or Panel Currency belonging to any
						other member, including, but not limited to, any family member or friend.
I. Dynata make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding any
						product or service received in connection with Dynata’s rewards program, including, but not limited
						to, any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Dynata is not, and will not
						be, liable or responsible for the performance of, or for the failure of the performance of, any
						product or service for which points or Panel Currency, incentives or rewards are redeemed. In
						addition, Dynata is not and will not be responsible or liable for any cost, damage, accident, delay,
						injury, loss, expense or inconvenience that may arise in connection with the use of, or defect in,
						any product or service for which points, Panel Currency, incentives or rewards are redeemed. Dynata
						will not replace any lost, stolen, misplaced or damaged incentives or rewards.
J. YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE POINTS, PANEL CURRENCY, INCENTIVES OR REWARDS
						EARNED THROUGH THE APPLICATIONS/SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO TAX, WHICH IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF
						THE PANEL MEMBER. Dynata may provide you and/or the appropriate government agency or taxing
						authority with information related to any payments or incentives you earn in connection with your
						use of the Applications/Services. You agree to provide Dynata with all required information to
						assist Dynata in complying with its reporting or withholding obligations. Dynata may withhold any
						tax from any incentive or reward as required by applicable law.
K. Dynata uses reasonable efforts to ensure that points or Panel Currency are credited and debited appropriately; however, the Panel member should review their account to ensure that their account correctly identifies the posted points or Panel Currency, incentives, or rewards, and reflects all of the appropriate redemption transactions. If you feel that your account was not credited or debited correctly or reflects incorrect redemption transactions, please send an email to
customerservice@gobranded.com
. Any email sent to Dynata
						should include the Panel member’s name, email address and specific information on the subject matter. Dynata will use reasonable efforts to investigate the matter and to respond back to the Panel member promptly. Dynata's decision is final and binding.
L. The suppliers or providers of the products or services offered in connection with Dynata’s
						rewards program and/or the owners or operators of the website(s)/webpage(s) on which redemption
						transactions occur, may have their own terms and conditions; please review these terms and
						conditions carefully.
M. Personal information may have to be collected, processed and/or disclosed in connection with
						Dynata’s rewards program and/or any request to redeem a reward or incentive. By agreeing to these
						Terms, you hereby agree to the collection, processing and/or disclosure of your personal information
						for such purpose(s) and all such personal information shall be subject to the terms set forth in
						Dynata’s Privacy Policy. Redemption of Virtual Mastercard® or Visa® may require verification of your
						identity by the financial institution responsible for issuing your Virtual Mastercard® and Visa®,
						and that such verification may require you to provide your date of birth, tax identification number,
						and similar information.
N. If a Panel member elects to donate points or Panel Currency to one of the charities approved by
						Dynata, Dynata will donate said points or Panel Currency to the selected charity. The donation is
						not made by or on behalf of Dynata and Dynata does not and will not match any donation. Please note
						that the donation option is not available on every panel owned and/or operated by or on behalf of
						Dynata. Please check the redemption options available for the panel to which you belong.
O. Your daily limit on the redemption of points or Panel Currency is limited to two (2) redemptions per 24-hour period.

						receive payments (whether via the redemption of points or Panel Currency or other means) of $600 or
						more in a tax year; and (ii) file a 1099-Misc form with the United States Internal Revenue Service
						(“IRS”) for such payments. In addition, Dynata will provide you with a completed 1099-Misc form for
						your tax compliance purposes. As a result, please see the following:
(1) If you have received payments of $599 during a tax year, your account will be suspended (i.e., you will not be able to receive further payments and will not be able to complete or participate in surveys) for the remainder of the applicable tax year unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and verified W-9 form.
(2) If you have received payments of $600 or more during a tax year, your account will be suspended
						indefinitely (i.e., you will not be able to receive further payments and will not be able to
						complete or participate in surveys) unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and
						verified W-9 form. In this case, your account will not be reinstated at the beginning of the next
						tax year, unless or until you provide Dynata with a completed and verified W-9 form.
(3) You agree to provide Dynata with your then-current address information. You have the responsibility to update Dynata on any change of address and Dynata is not responsible for any misdirected communication based on your failure to do so.

						Panel member’s contact information will be removed from any further communication or contact lists.

21. Severability
If any term or provision of these Terms shall be held or declared to be invalid or unenforceable for
						any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such term or provision shall be deemed null and
						void and shall not affect the application and/or interpretation of these Terms. The remaining terms
						or provisions of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect, as if the invalid or
						unenforceable term or provision was not a part of these Terms.
22. Arbitration Agreement (United States only)
All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth
						below) in connection with the Terms, use of any product or service provided by Dynata, or related to
						the processing of personal data, that cannot be resolved informally or on an individual basis in
						small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms
						of this Section 22 (this “
Arbitration Agreement
”). Unless otherwise agreed, all
						arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and
						Dynata, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
						successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
						services or goods provided under the Terms.
Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written
						Notice of Dispute (“
Notice
”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or
						dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Dynata should be sent to: 4 Research Drive, Suite
						300, Shelton, Connecticut 06484 USA; ATTN: Arbitration Notice. After the Notice is received, you and
						Dynata may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Dynata do not resolve the
						claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
						arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to
						the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
						either party is entitled.
Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
						(“
JAMS
”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“
ADR
                        Provider
”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not
						available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of
						the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
						method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
						with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the “
JAMS Rules
”) governing
						the arbitration are available online at
https://www.jamsadr.com/
. The arbitration shall be conducted
						by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
						is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
						non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes
						where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
						right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a
						location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
						unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
						parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
						award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party
						shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the
						arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone,
						online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
						initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties
						or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
If you or Dynata pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within
						the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline
						imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.
If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
						and Dynata, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
						cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
						part of any claim (including any claim regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement or
						any unconscionability in connection with these Terms). The arbitrator shall have the authority to
						award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
						under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
						statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
						including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
						relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
						is final and binding upon you and Dynata.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL
						IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
						arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited,
						more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited
						review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dynata in any state or
						federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
						WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR
						LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR
						USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
						USER.
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator
						and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
						confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from
						submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
						arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. If any part or parts of this
						Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable with regards to any
						particular subject matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts
						shall be of no force and effect with regard to such specific subject matter and shall be severed and
						the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by
						the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
						portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Dynata.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Dynata may bring an individual action in small claims court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
						federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim
						measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration
						Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
						and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade
						secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in
						court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within
						Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA for such purpose.
23. Governing Laws; Jurisdiction and Venue
These Terms and your access to, use of or participation in the Applications/Services shall be
						governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Connecticut, USA, without
						regard to any portion of any choice of law principles (whether those of Connecticut or any other
						jurisdiction) that might provide for application of a different jurisdiction’s laws. All claims or
						disputes arising in connection with these Terms and/or your access to, use of or participation in
						the Applications/Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or Federal
						courts located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA.
24. Miscellaneous Terms
The headings contained in these Terms are for reference only and shall have no effect on the
						interpretation and/or application of these Terms. Dynata’s failure to enforce a breach by you of
						these Terms shall not waive or release you from such breach and shall not waive, release or prevent
						Dynata from enforcing any subsequent breach by you of these Terms. These Terms and any rules, terms
						or policies referenced herein or incorporated herein, and any Panel-specific requirements, represent
						the entire understanding and agreement between Dynata and you with respect to the subject matter
						hereof.

Ad partners' use of information.

You may see these ads or promotions in several places, including, without limitation, in non-Dynata mobile apps (for example, in a gaming app), after which Dynata shall provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about the ad or promotion that you were exposed to. To facilitate the completion of surveys on ads or promotions, Dynata has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including, without limitation, in many other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides these ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and many or all of the other types of information described in the "
Information collected through automated means
" section above (including your ongoing geolocation, if your device permits the collection of geolocation). Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Dynata is testing for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Dynata that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Dynata to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. With your consent, the ad companies also use the information they collect about your device and your interactions with the Application/Services and other mobile apps to provide you with other in-app advertising that has been tailored to your interests and for other purposes.

Additionally, UIDs and information collected by automated means are provided to third parties, including, without limitation, clients, partners, agents and/or vendor for the purposes of identifying respondents for re-contact surveys or communications, fraud detection and/or prevention, database matching, data validation, data append, coding, data segmentation, and reward, incentive, and/or sweepstakes or promotion related services.
In connection with your survey data, Dynata or the client may associate certain demographic attributes to you. Dynata may share with third parties, including but not limited to clients, the geographic and/or demographic data Dynata collects from you during enrolment or through certain profile questions Dynata may ask you. Such data may be shared with third parties on an individual respondent level or aggregate summary form (i.e. a group of respondents).
