Introduction
Headstart International Pty Ltd (“
we
”, “
our
”
and “
us
”) is committed to responsible privacy practices and to complying
with the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (
Cth
) (“
Privacy Act
”) to the extent they apply to us.
This Privacy Policy sets out our policies on how we handle
personal information, the types of personal information we collect, how that
information is used and who we share that information with.
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. At any
time, the latest version of our Privacy Policy is available from our website at

. By
continuing to use our website, or otherwise continuing to deal with us, you

What is personal information?
In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” has the
meaning set out in the Privacy Act. Essentially, personal information is
information or an opinion about an individual who is reasonably identifiable.
What types of personal information do we collect?
The types of personal information we collect from you depend
on the circumstances in which the information is collected.
When you visit our websites, such as
headstartint.com
,
cactusstudios.com
and
zoodio.world
, and
other websites operated by us (such as our Social Media channels) (“
Websites
”),
we collect information about you, such as details about how our Websites are
used and interacted with, browser information (including the browser type and
language preference), information about your device (such as hardware
identifiers, platform type, settings and components and the presence of
required plugins), as well as referring and exit pages (including pages viewed
and other interactions with web content). We may use such information collected
for
a number of
purposes, including for operating and
optimising the Websites, in connection with our advertising purposes, and for
research or analysis. We may also collect basic contact information including
your name and email address if you register and create an account with us.
When you download, access and/or play our applications/games
or use our other services ("
Apps
"), we collect information
from you or your device, such as your name and email address (e.g. to create
and maintain your user account), device information (such as hardware
identifiers, platform type, settings and components and the presence of required
plugins), country and region information (derived from IP address or device
settings), device event information, including crash reports and system
activity details (e.g. whether you encountered an error playing our games or
lost Internet access) and information related to your in-app or in-game
activities, such as profile information, gameplay information, as well as
information relating to your in-app/game purchases and data about how you use
our Apps. We use this data to provide our Apps and services to you, including
for the purposes of optimisation, preventing fraud, customising in-game offers
and verifying purchases.
The information that we collect can be further classified as
follows:
Information
     You Give Us:
When you register for and/or use our Websites or
     Apps (for example, when you create an account on our Websites or our Apps,
     populate your in-app profile, communicate with other users (e.g. through
     in-game chat or forum posts), contact our customer service or participate
     in any sweepstakes, contests or promotion), we collect and store any
     information that you give us, including the following:
User
      account information:
we collect certain information from you
      during the registration/ sign-up process for the Websites or Apps. This
      may include information like your name, locale, phone number, or email
      address.
Content
      information:
Our
Websites
or Apps may
      allow you to create, upload or share content such as text, images, audio,
      your profile information (such as your avatar name and appearance) or
      other content you create when you play our games or otherwise use our
      Websites or Apps.
Log
      in services:
You may be able to log in to our Apps using sign-in
      services (“Social Login”) such as Facebook Connect, Apple’s Game
Center
, or an Open ID provider. These third-party
      Social Login platforms will authenticate your identity and provide you
      with the option to share certain personal information with us such as
      your name or email address to pre-populate our signup form. Social Login
      platforms like Facebook Connect allow you to post information about your
      activities on our
Websites
or Apps to your
      profile page on such Social Login platform to share with others within
      your network. We may collect and record information through the relevant
      Social Login platform in accordance with the policies and terms of that
      Social Login platform.
Invite
      a Friend:
Our Apps may offer you the opportunity to invite your
      contacts from a Social Login platform (such as your Facebook friends) so
      that those contacts can
be located in
your Apps
      and/or you can invite them to join you in our games. Such contact
      information will be used only for the purpose of sending the invitation
      to the addressee(s).
Interaction
      with Customer Service:
We may collect your email address and any
      other personal information you provide when you contact our customer
      service or otherwise communicate with us.
Forums,
      Sweepstakes, Contests and Surveys:
We may also acquire information
      from you through (1) your access and participation in forums or in-game
      chats on the Websites or Apps, or (2) your participation in surveys
      regarding the Apps. We may also provide you with the opportunity to
      participate in a sweepstake or contest through our
Websites
or Apps. If you participate, we will request certain personal information
      from you. Participation in these sweepstakes and contests is voluntary
      and you, therefore, have a choice
whether or not
to disclose this information. The requested information typically
      includes your contact information (such as name and shipping address),
      and demographic information (such as postcode or equivalent). We use this
      information to administer the sweepstakes or contest and to notify
      winners and award prizes. We may use a third-party service provider to
      conduct these sweepstakes or contests; in such case, that company is
      prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose.
Information
     Collected Automatically:
When you interact with or use our
Websites
or Apps, we automatically collect certain
     information about your device and your use of our Websites or Apps. This

     address, device ID, hardware and software information, advertising ID,
     gameplay data, standard sever log information, your connections and
     interactions with other users, purchase histories with us and social media
     data (if you have linked your account and in accordance with your sharing
     permissions). We (or the third parties we work with) use standard tracking
     technologies (like log files, software development kits (SDKs) and web
     beacons) to do this. Information we collect include:
Mobile
      Platform information:
When you play or otherwise use any of our
      Apps, we or third party partners will collect and process certain
      information about you, including your unique device ID (persistent /
      non-persistent), hardware type, device maker, media access control (“MAC”)
      address, international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), the type and
      version of your operating system (“OS”), language of the OS, your unique
      device ID, your time zone, the screen size of your device, mobile device
      Advertising ID (known as “IDFA” for iOS devices, or “Android Advertising
      ID” for Android devices), your general geolocation information
      (city/country based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address) and your
      email address (if you have connected to Facebook or Google+). This
      information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand
      usage trends so that we can improve and personalize the Apps for our
      users. Device identifier / information such as device type, hardware
      model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other
      technical data like screen size, or combination of this data, is also
      collected and used to determine device compatibility and optimal
      settings. We may also share this information with our advertising
      partners to enable the technical delivery of personalized ads to your
      device, as further described below.
User
      ID:
When you register to use the Apps, we create a unique user
      ID to track your use of our Apps.
Game
      Data Collection:
We collect gameplay information about how you
      use and play our games. For example, we automatically collect data such
      as your game session time, your in-game interactions (including with
      other players, where applicable), in-app purchases that you may make,
      resource events such as the acquisition or spend of in-game virtual
      currencies by you, progression events that are used to mark your progress
      or movement within the game (e.g. achievements) and install timestamps.
      This information may be associated with your user ID, IP address or
      device ID for the purpose of providing you our Websites and Apps, and
      improving and personalizing them, or to make inferences regarding your
      preferences, predispositions, behaviour, abilities and aptitudes. With
      your consent, we will also collect your exact or precise location so that
      we are able to match you with other players in your area.
Mobile
      Analytics:
Like most mobile applications, we use mobile
      analytics tools to collect certain information about your usage of our
      mobile applications and games, as well as on your device and the health
      of our Apps to allow us to better understand the functionality of our
      Apps on your device and for app optimization purposes. Such tools may
      record information such as how often you use the application or game,
      feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, events that occur within
      the application or game, aggregated usage and performance data, and where
      the application or game was downloaded from (i.e. which application
      store).
If you play or purchase our games or applications on your
mobile device and/or tablet, we receive information about you from the app
stores and other mobile platform providers. This information includes your
username and/or device ID and the fact that you made a
purchase,
but
does not include any sensitive or financial information. Some mobile
platforms may send information to us that you authorize them to provide. Our
mobile games also may request additional personal information from you, such as
push notification tokens, your device location, or a contact list, and we will
collect this information only if you give us your consent. We may collect and
store information locally on your device, using mechanisms like cookies,
browser web storage (including HTML 5), and application data caches. We may
also collect answers you provide to questions we ask and other information in
relation to your dealings with us.
When you participate in social features such as chat, any
audio, visual, and/or electronic information that you disclose may be read,
copied, collected, or used by other players, and may become publicly available.
We recommend that you ensure that your privacy settings reflect your
preferences.
If you work with us, or you apply to do so, we may also
collect information for the purpose of considering your application or relevant
to you working with us, including your qualifications, resume, reference
information from your nominated referees, bank details, feedback from
supervisors and training records.
Except as described in this section, we do not generally
require you to disclose any sensitive information (e.g. details of your race,
religious belief, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union) to us. If
you do provide us with sensitive information for any reason, you consent to us
collecting that information and using and disclosing that information for the
purpose for which you disclosed it to us and as permitted by any relevant laws.
We may also collect personal information as otherwise
permitted or required by applicable law or regulation.

Use of cookies and tracking technologies to collect information
automatically
A. Cookies
Our Websites may contain links to other sites. This Privacy Policy applies to
our
Websites
and not any linked sites which are not
operated or controlled by us. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of
each Website that collects your personal information.
We may use “cookies” and similar technology on our websites
and in other technology applications. Cookies are small text files placed on
your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain
that placed the cookie. The use of such technologies is an industry
standard, and
helps to monitor the effectiveness of
advertising and how visitors use our websites/applications. We may use such
technologies to generate statistics, measure your activity, improve the
usefulness of our websites/applications and to enhance the “customer”
experience.
The Websites may make use of first or third party cookies
(whether session or persistent cookies) and similar technologies, for such
things as session management, account access/ authentication, to recognize
returning visitors, for storing and
honoring
user
preferences and settings, combating fraud, maintaining and monitoring the
infrastructure of the Websites, ensuring security protections,
analyzing
how our Websites perform and other analytics
purposes, and fulfilling other legitimate purposes as further described above
in this Privacy Policy (such as fixing issues with and improving our Websites
and related user experience). We also use analytics cookies to better
understand how our
Websites
are being used by tracking
how you interact with the Websites and where you click.
If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can adjust your
Internet browser to refuse cookies or to warn you when cookies are being used.
However, our websites may not function properly or optimally if cookies have
been turned off.
To the extent that information collected through “cookies”
and other similar technology constitutes personal information, we will handle
such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
B. Other tracking technologies
We and our third party partners, affiliates, or analytics service providers use
standard tracking technologies (like web beacons, SDKs, APIs, scripts and tags)
to identify a computer or device used, to “remember” things about your visit or
your use of the Apps (such as your preferences or a user name) and to help us
understand things like, what pages and features you use and the games you play.
Such information may be linked to or combined with other
personal information we process about you, such as your user ID, for purposes
such as improving the quality of our Apps, tailoring recommendations to your
interests, providing and personalising our Apps including making our Apps
easier to use, and for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes.
Please refer to guidance provided by your device
manufacturer, operating system developer, or individual web browser if you
would like help in managing your preferences with respect to tracking
technologies used in our Apps.
C. Interest-Based Advertising
Some of our Apps employ ad-serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs,
web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies to deliver
interest-based advertising to you about third-party products and services. We
may via our third-party advertising partners, also advertise our Apps to you on
third parties' websites. You may also see our Apps advertised in other services
(like on Facebook).
You can find more information here:
When you use our Apps and play our games, some third-party tools (SDKs)
integrated within our Apps may collect and use certain information collected
from your device for the purpose of ad display and optimization. Such
information includes GAID (Google Advertising ID on Android devices) or IDFA
(Identifier for Advertising on iOS devices), region (i.e. the location where a
given language is used), geo-location information (with your consent) and IP
address. This Privacy Policy does not govern our third-party advertising
partners, as they have their own privacy policies, which are accessible using
the links provided below. We have no access to or control over such third
parties. In addition to identifiers, these third parties may also collect
information relating to:
Advertisements
     served and the location of the
ad;
Length
     of time an advertisement was
visible;
Domain
     type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and
Click-throughs
     (i.e. whether a click was made on the ad) and advertisement response.
They use this information (alone or in combination with the
information they have collected about you when you use third-party websites or
services) to:
enable
     the technical delivery of ads to your device and verify click-throughs
     and/or
installs;
provide
     you with more relevant ads about our Apps (for example, to present you
     with an offer for one of our games you might enjoy
);
enable
     offer walls, which allow you to choose from various rewarded ad or market
     research
offers;
track
     results and measure the effectiveness of ads; and
improve
     the accuracy of their targeting and measurement systems.
We recommend that you review our advertising partners'
privacy policies for more information, further details of which are set out

options available to limit their collection and use of your information by
visiting the websites of the
Network
Advertising Initiative
and the
Digital
Advertising Alliance
, and the web pages for
Facebook's ad preferences tool
and
privacy policy
. Similarly, you
can learn about your options to opt out of mobile app tracking by certain
advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the
advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device. For more information about how
to change these settings go to:

Please
note:
adjusting your
preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer
receive advertisements, it only means the ads you do see will be less relevant
to your interests. Our advertising partners will also still use your device’s
advertising ID to serve you with ads that may be less relevant to you; for
example, we may use this for frequency capping (in other words, to control the
maximum number of times you see the same ad from us). You may also reset the
Advertising ID associated with your device by following the instructions
provided by your device manufacturer or operating system developer.
D. Analytics Technologies
We use our own game servers and third-party analytic technologies to collect
information about how you use our Websites and Apps, your computer or device
and the health of our Apps.
You can find more information here:
For
     instance, we may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
     Google, Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), on
     our
Websites
. Google Analytics uses cookies or
     other tracking technologies to help us
analyze
how users interact with and use the Websites, compile reports on the
     Websites’ activity, and provide other services related to our
Websites’
activity and usage. The technologies used by
     Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of the visit
     and whether you are a return visitor. The Websites do not use Google
     Analytics to gather the information that personally identifies you. The
     information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and
     stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s
privacy policies
.
     To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt-out
     of tracking of analytics by Google, click
here
.
For
     our Apps on iOS and Android, we may use the services of Google Firebase.
     We may also use the Google Firebase SDK (Software Development Kit) which
     is an analytics service that provides us with the ability to obtain and
     collect statistical data on the usage of our games and apps so that we can
     better understand how our users are using our games and apps. For this
     purpose, Google Firebase processes mobile identifiers such as the IDFA,
     GAID or similar mobile identifiers. Their privacy policy is available at
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
.
Your
     browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because there
     is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track
     signals, we do not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals.
     However, we provide you with the ability to opt out of the use of tracking
     technologies to send you interest-based advertising as explained above.
How can you access and correct personal information we hold about you?
You may request access to, or update or correct your,
personal information held by us. To make a request, please contact us in

Policy). We may require that the person requesting access provide suitable
identification and
where
permitted by law we may
charge an administration fee for granting access to your personal information.

collection, use or disclosure of personal information, or if you believe that
we have not complied with this Privacy Policy or our obligations under
Australia’s privacy laws, please contact us (see
section 14
of
this Privacy Policy).
When contacting us please provide as much detail as possible
in relation to your question, comment or complaint.
We will take any privacy complaint seriously and any
complaint will be assessed with the aim of resolving any issue in a timely and
efficient manner. We request that you cooperate with us during this process and
provide us with any relevant information that we may need.
If you are not satisfied with the outcome of our assessment
of your complaint, you may wish to contact the Office of the Australian
Information Commissioner.
Children
We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections
when it comes to children. Some of our Apps are directed to children, while
other Apps or portions of them are intended for use by adults and teens aged 13
and older. For Apps that are directed to children or that allow children to
submit personal information, we will collect, use, and disclose personal
information as described in this Privacy Policy, with certain differences and
specific practices as described below.
If we allow children to create an account or otherwise
engage with us over time, we will obtain parental consent prior to the
collection of their personal information.
In order to
obtain this consent, we sometimes ask your child to provide a parent's email
address so that we may directly notify you of our privacy practices and obtain
your consent. When we do this, we delete the email address provided if a parent
does not timely respond to the request for consent.
We may allow children to enter contests, sweepstakes, or
other promotions, or receive a one-time communication from us. When we do that,
we will collect the child's first name, email address, and sometimes their
state of residence, as well as a parent's email address to provide you with
notice that your child has entered the promotion and an opportunity for you to
opt your child out. We will use the collected information for the purpose of
that promotion or communication, and then delete the information from our
records once it is no longer required. We do not send text messages or other
non-email messages (like chat) to children.
At any time, you can refuse to permit us to collect personal
information from your child and can request that we delete from our records the
personal information we have collected. Parents may delete their child's
account, change their child's privacy settings, or access and modify their
child’s personal data at any time by contacting customer support at
customerservice@headstartint.com
.
If you are a parent or legal guardian and you give your
permission for your child to register for one or other of the services, you
thereby agree to the terms relating to use of the Apps or services by your
child.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data
Firebase Service Data is personal information that Google collects and generates
during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.
Examples of Firebase Service Data include information about service usage,
resource identifiers like application IDs and package name/bundle IDs, technical
and operational details of usage such as IP addresses, and direct communications
with developers from feedback and support related conversations.
*Services covered include Firebase A/B Testing, Firebase App Distribution,
  Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Dynamic Links,
  Firebase Hosting, Firebase In-App Messaging, Firebase ML,
  Firebase Performance Monitoring, Firebase Realtime Database,

Sub-policy 4
https://www.tenjin.io/privacy/:
LAST UPDATED: February 25, 2025
Tenjin, Inc. is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. The first section of this document describes our practices in connection with information that we collect from our customers and potential customers through the websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “Websites”), and from users of the Websites (whether or not such users are our customers). The Websites include tenjin.io, tenjin.com, blog.tenjin.io, blog.tenjin.com, docs.tenjin.io, docs.tenjin.com, track.tenjin.io, track.tenjin.com, and dashboard.tenjin.com. The second section describes the information we collect in the course of providing services to our customers (the “Services”). If you are a Tenjin employee or contractor and want to learn how Tenjin uses your personal information, you can find that information in the “Tenjin Notice of Data Privacy for Employees” posted in Confluence.
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act (the “UKDPA”)
Tenjin provides tools and services to mobile app developers so that they can track and analyze certain End User actions in the context of mobile marketing. Tenjin does not collect any data directly (except from the companies and people that sign up for Tenjin or request marketing info, which is described in the Website Privacy Policy below). With regard to Tenjin’s Services, under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and the UK’s Data Protection Act (the “UKDPA”), Tenjin is a data processor. As a data processor, Tenjin processes, and may store, information sent by Tenjin customers from their mobile apps. Tenjin’s customers may send information about the End Users of their apps, and the users’ devices, to Tenjin for processing and storage. The mobile app developers must receive your consent in order for Tenjin to process, and perhaps store, your data. Tenjin recognizes your right of access under Section 15 of GDPR and Section 45 of UKDPA. If you are a user of a Tenjin customer’s mobile app, and you wish to exercise your right of access, you must contact the owner or operator of the mobile app (the data collector).
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
The California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) became law on January 1st, 2020 but enforcement begins six (6) months from the date the California Attorney General issues final regulations (which shall be no later than July 1st, 2020). With regard to Tenjin’s Services, under CCPA, Tenjin is a service provider. As a service provider, Tenjin processes, and may store, information sent by Tenjin customers from their mobile apps. Tenjin’s customers may send information about the End Users of their apps, and the users’ devices, to Tenjin for processing and storage. Tenjin customers must comply with the opt-out requirements under CCPA (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.120(a)) and take into account any exceptions or other requirements mandated by law. As a service provider, Tenjin relies on CCPA’s business purpose exemption under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.140(t)(2)(C) and as a service provider, Tenjin does not have any direct obligations to the End Users to obtain consent, provide opt-outs, or delete data. If you are a user of a Tenjin customer’s mobile app and you wish to opt-out or exercise another right under CCPA, you must contact the app publisher (the business).
The above applies to both Section 1 and Section 2 below.

How We May Use and Disclose Other Information
We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information. If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

By creating an Account, you provide your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your child’s Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy, and as needed per Product. If at any time you do not want you or your child to be bound by these terms, you must deactivate your Account by emailing your request to:

In this latter case, the parent account and all child profiles under the parent account will be removed from the KIDOZ database and all user activity information previously collected will be deleted and no additional data will be collected for that user.

Kidoz and GDPR-K Compliance:
Safeguarding Children's Digital Privacy
At Kidoz, we recognize the paramount importance of protecting children’s privacy in the digital world. This white paper outlines our commitment and comprehensive approach to ensuring full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly its provisions for children (GDPR-K). Through our technology, stringent policies, and transparent practices, Kidoz not only meets but exceeds the requirements set forth to safeguard children’s personal data.
Background
The digital landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities, particularly when it comes to advertising to children. Compliance with GDPR-K and COPPA is not just a regulatory requirement but a cornerstone of trust between families, brands, and content publishers. Kidoz has risen to this challenge, creating a contextual mobile advertising network that respects privacy while enabling sustainable revenue for app developers.
About Kidoz
Kidoz is a leading provider of child-safe digital advertising solutions. Recognizing the vulnerability of children in the digital ecosystem, we have embedded privacy and safety into the DNA of our services, ensuring a secure and positive online experience for our young users.
Key Provisions and Kidz's Alignment
GDPR-K emphasizes several critical areas: the age of digital consent, data minimization, privacy by design, clear communication, and strict limits on data sharing and marketing. Kidoz adheres to these principles, implementing robust measures to comply with each requirement.
Kidoz's Approach to GDPR-K Compliance
Data Privacy and Protection Policies
Kidoz has developed comprehensive data protection policies that govern every aspect of our operations. From data collection to processing and sharing, we ensure the highest standards of privacy and security. Our policies are regularly reviewed and audited by an official certifier, PRIVO.
‍
Please find a case study, written by PRIVO about our effort regarding GDPR-K:
https://www.privo.com/kidoz-case-study
Consent Verification
In addressing the essential considerations surrounding the age of digital consent under GDPR-K, Kidoz adopts a universally cautious approach, operating on the principle that
ALL users
within our network are treated as if they are below the age of digital consent.
This policy underscores our steadfast commitment to privacy and safety, ensuring that no personal data is ever shared with third parties.
When responding to advertising requests, Kidoz meticulously removes any personally identifiable information (PII) from the transaction. This rigorous process ensures that every ad served through our network is entirely devoid of personal data, upholding our promise to safeguard user privacy at every turn. By default, we operate with the highest standards of data protection, effectively ensuring that our user base is shielded from any form of data sharing that could compromise their privacy.
Privacy by Design
From the initial stages of product development to each subsequent update, Kidoz integrates privacy by design principles. This approach means that every new feature, service, or product we develop undergoes rigorous privacy impact assessments to identify and mitigate risks to children's data privacy. Our engineering teams are trained to prioritize privacy, ensuring that the default settings for all our services are always set to the highest level of data protection.
Kidoz's Commitment to Clearly Labeled Advertising
Kidoz takes a transparent approach to advertising by distinctly labeling our ads, ensuring they are easily recognized as advertisements and not mistaken for content. This practice is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of our user experience, fostering trust among children, parents, and content publishers alike. By incorporating a clear, consistent watermark across all our advertisements, Kidoz guarantees that users can effortlessly distinguish between entertainment or educational content and promotional material
Ad Platform Innovation
In our pursuit of setting industry benchmarks for responsible and child-friendly digital advertising, Kidoz not only rigorously ensured its advertising platform met stricter GDPR-K compliance standards but also implemented an exhaustive manual review process.
Every campaign and ad creative submitted to our network is meticulously examined by our dedicated in-house team
. This hands-on approach ensures that all advertisements are not only relevant and appropriate for our young audience but also fully compliant with the strictest privacy standards.
Following this manual filtration our system is intricately designed to automatically
filter out any campaign or ad creative that could potentially collect personal information
, such as names, birth dates, email addresses, or locations. This comprehensive review process ensures all advertisements are relevant, appropriate for our young audience, and strictly adhere to privacy regulations. By integrating this dual-layered approach—combining automated safeguards with human oversight—Kidoz underscores its unwavering commitment to creating a secure and nurturing digital environment, completely free of privacy concerns.
COPPA and GDPRkids™ Compliance
In our dedication to exceed the standard requirements for children's online privacy, the Kidoz team has proactively sought and attained oversight from an FTC-approved
COPPA Safe Harbor
through
PRIVO
, affirming our platform's compliance with the stringent measures designed to protect children aged 13 and under.
Furthering our commitment to global privacy standards, Kidoz has also become a proud participant in
GDPR
kids
™ Privacy Assured Program
. This initiative aligns with the GDPR's nuanced approach to children's privacy, recognizing the varying ages of consent across EU member states and the UK, which range from 13 to 16 years old.

ironSource Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connetecuit and Utah, please see “State Privacy Rights” section of this privacy policy for information related to privacy laws in these states.
Information We Collect:
Information collected through our Ad Network (“Ad Network Information”)

How We Use the Information We Collect:
As stated above, we provide 4 main services. For each such service, we use the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general description of how we use information across our services:
Operating our Ad Network
– We use Ad Network Information to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting, billing and attribution: We use Ad Network Information to generate reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Network Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud detection and prevention: We use Ad Network Information for detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.

However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content of the ads served by different networks.
Sending ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network Information.

Operating our Ad Quality Platform
– We use Ad Quality Information to operate our Ad Quality Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Ad Quality Platform in order to allow them to see which ads were served within their apps, and how such ads affected the use of their apps.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
