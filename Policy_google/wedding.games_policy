Apps – Privacy Policy
Updated: July 26, 2018
WHO WE ARE
Salon™ Studio aims to entertain and educate players via games.  We care about our players. We’re a small team, but we try hard to do the right thing and are excited to be making a difference through our games.
YOUR PRIVACY MATTERS TO US
We also care about the privacy of our players.
Salon™ Studio and its affiliates (also referred to as “we,”, “us,” or “our”) are dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our players (“players” or “you”).  This Privacy Policy (the “Policy” describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information, including any personal information, that you provide or we collect in connection with our websites (the “Sites”) or any Salon™ Studio game (the “Salon™ Studio Games”) provided on a mobile platform (collectively, the “Services.”)  Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited to information collected or received by Salon™ Studio through your use of the Service.  Salon™ Studio is not responsible for the actions of third party people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer.  Any link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.
By using the Service, you are expressing your agreement to this Policy and the processing of your data, including your personal information, in the manner provided in this Policy.  If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
Salon™ Studio collects information as described below.  Our primary goals in collecting and using information is to create your account, provide Services to you, improve our Services, and create reports for internal use.  We store information on servers located in the United States via Amazon Web Services, IBM Softlayer, Google Cloud Engine, Google Firebase and other Google Services and may store information on servers and equipment in other countries.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY - SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS
We value your children’s privacy.
It is important that you understand that we do use social networks in our game to allow players who are 13 years old or older to have fun by exchanging their gameplay events with other players over the age of 13.  The Social Networks we use are based on prominent third party social networks, like Facebook, Apple’s Game Center, Google+, and Amazon’s GameCircle.  We rely on the age restrictions from these networks to make sure only players over the age of 13 can share information.  It is up to you to make sure your child is of the required age to be using a social network.
We do allow players who are 13 years old or older to participate in the Forums on our Sites and in surveys to share their experiences of playing the game.
With the exception of information collected from Social Networks, Forums, and Surveys, we do not collect any personal identifying information in game, including names or email addresses, from players, except when we believe a player’s safety is at risk.
The Internet and connected applications offers a world of opportunity for children. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. We encourage you to visit the http://getnetwise.org site and look through the "Kids Safety" section together. Your efforts to instill responsible information practices will help steer your children to age-appropriate sites and will go a long way toward ensuring that your children have enriching experiences online.
MOBILE GAMES
INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY
We collect game data, hardware type, the version of your operating system, IP addresses, and device identifiers in our Mobile Games with the sole purpose of helping us support the internal operations of our Mobile Games, like troubleshooting, understanding usage trends, understand generally the location of our users (like zip code information), and limiting the number of ads shown.  This information is not used for behavioral tracking for advertisements.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS
We may collect user information for Facebook Connect, Apple’s Game Center, Google+, and Amazon’s GameCircle ( the “Social Networks”.)  Each of these services requires you to be 13 or older to use them.  The information we collect when you connect to Social Networks may include: (1) your name, (2) your social network user name or identifier, (3) locale, city, state and country, (4) sex, (5) birth date, (6) email address, (7) profile picture or its URL, and (8) the social networking provider user identification numbers for your friends.
If you want us to delete the data we receive from Social Networks about you, please contact us at
contact@mystylinglounge.com
.
YOUR VOICE
We have a feature called “Your Voice” in some of our games that asks users questions about pop culture, current events, and other interesting issues. Users can respond with one out of four multiple choice answers.  There is also the option to skip a question.  These answers are shared with friends within a user’s Social Networks.  These answers are also aggregated so that users can see what users, in aggregate, choose as the most popular answers.  The answers are purposefully multiple choice answers only, so that they do not reveal any personally identifiable information.
INVITE A FRIEND
Salon™ Studio may offer users who are 13 years old or older the opportunity to invite your contacts from Social Networks (such as your Facebook friends) so that those contacts can be located in our games and/or you can invite them to join you in our games.  Such contact information will be used only for the purpose of sending communications to the addressee.  Your or the third party may contact us at
contact@mystylinglounge.com
