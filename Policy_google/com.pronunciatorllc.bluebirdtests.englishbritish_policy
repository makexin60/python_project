This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for https://bluebirdlanguages.com. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the following:
1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.

Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via registration, email or other direct contact from you.
We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization.
Unless you ask us to, we will
not
contact you via email in the future to tell you about new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.
Access to Device Storage
The first time that you download a Bluebird audio lesson to your Android device, you will be asked: “Allow Bluebird to access photos, media, and files on your device?” This is a generic question that Android asks when you want to save items to your device’s storage. If you click “Allow,” it means you will be able to download and listen to Bluebird audio lessons on your device; if you click “Deny,” it means that you won’t be able to download and listen to Bluebird audio lessons on your device (but you will be able to do the quizzes).
Bluebird cannot, and will never attempt to, access “photos, media, and files” on your device that are not Bluebird audio lessons. However, it does need this permission in order to download and use Bluebird audio lessons. This is typical for all audiobook apps, and is not unique to Bluebird.
Registration
In order to track progress and quiz scores in the Bluebird Languages App, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give a valid email address. This information is used to identify you if you contact us for technical support, and to help you retrieve your login credentials if you misplace them.
Cookies
We use “cookies” on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.

Security
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as email address and chosen password), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
