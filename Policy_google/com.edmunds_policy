However, certain device information may be considered "Personal Information" or "Personal Data" under state consumer privacy laws.

Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Your PII may be shared between us and the companies with which we do business, and may also be disclosed to other entities that work with us or those companies to fulfill your request or to offer or provide other products and services to you.
We provide vehicle price quote and inquiry services and dealer communication services, including (i) our CarCode messaging service that enables emails, text and chats between a consumer and either a dealer or an Edmunds service provider, (ii) our vehicle trade-in and appraisal tools displayed on the Edmunds Automotive Network and dealer websites that enable a consumer to find our True Market Value® of a vehicle and that transmit such consumer's PII and that value to the dealer, (iii) dedicated dealer phone numbers displayed on the Edmunds Automotive Network, and (iv) our customer service department which, if a consumer contacts them, may act as an intermediary between such consumer and a dealer (collectively, "Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services").
If you use a Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service, we may use the phone number or email address that you use or provide to obtain or associate additional information about you. We keep copies of email, text and chat communications, and also may make and keep recordings of phone conversations between users of our Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services, including consumers and dealer personnel who communicate through our CarCode messaging service.

Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising
The cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (the "Program") was developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet. Edmunds has elected to implement the Program.
The Program applies to "online behavioral advertising," which is defined as the collection of data online from a particular computer or device regarding Web viewing behaviors over time, and across non-affiliate websites, for the purpose of using that data to predict visitor preferences or interests to deliver advertising to that computer or device based on the preferences or interests inferred from those Web viewing behaviors. (The Program does not apply to a website's collection of viewing behavior solely for its own uses, or to "contextual advertising" that delivers advertisements based on the content of a Web page, a search query or a visitor's contemporaneous behavior on a website.)
Our advertisers may from time to time use data collected about your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network and other websites to target ads to you on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other websites and online services.
In addition, the Edmunds Automotive Network may from time to time permit third parties to collect non-personally identifiable website usage information about our visitors for the purpose of facilitating the serving of targeted ads on other websites and online services.

These third parties may also use personally identifiable information obtained from other sources to serve advertisements over time and across websites and online services.
Other companies' use of information collected through their cookies and other tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies and not this one. To learn more about your choices and how to opt out from receiving the types of ads described above, please

When you use Edmunds to obtain offers from third parties to purchase your vehicle, Edmunds sends your User-Provided Identifiers to the Dealers that make those offers and/or companies that obtain those offers from Dealers. When you use Edmunds to estimate the trade-in or sale value of your vehicle, Edmunds may also send your User-Provided Identifiers to Dealers who may be interested in your vehicle and this disclosure may be considered a "sale" or sharing for cross context behavioral advertising under California and certain other states' laws.
When you use an Edmunds product or service to calculate or obtain from Edmunds your estimated lease or loan payments for a vehicle offered by a Dealer for sale or lease -- and if you consent -- Edmunds transmits your Credit Information to a company that uses that information to obtain additional information about your credit from a credit reporting agency, which then sends Edmunds a transaction ID that allows Edmunds to collect your FICO score.  The credit reporting agency may make available to the Dealer offering that vehicle your FICO score and other credit information. In addition, Edmunds may disclose to that Dealer your self-reported approximate credit score, FICO score and estimated payment terms and may also advise that dealer either that Edmunds believes that you prequalify for those payment terms for that vehicle or that Edmunds did not have sufficient information to determine if you prequalify.
We retain the Personal Information we collect for as long as reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes disclosed at the point of collection or in this Privacy Statement or for other business purposes, unless a shorter or longer retention period is required by law or contract.  The length of retention may vary depending upon factors such as:
The existence of an ongoing relationship between you and us;
Recordkeeping or legal compliance requirements;
Service, product and network security and integrity purposes; and
The need to resolve inquiries or complaints
The following metrics are for the verifiable requests submitted by California Consumers during calendar year 2023:
Requests to opt-out: 97 received and complied with in whole or in part
Requests to delete: 7 received and complied with in whole or in part, and 19 received and denied due to not being verifiable

The information you submit may include your name, address, e-mail address and/or telephone number. We refer to the personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to us in response to requests therefor on the Edmunds Automotive Network as your "PII." (Unless we have a street address (or equivalent) for you, we do not consider your city, state or ZIP code to be your PII.)
We also collect information about the devices you use to access the Edmunds Automotive Network as soon as you visit the Edmunds Automotive Network. We do not consider this information to be your PII. However, certain device information may be considered "Personal Information" or "Personal Data" under state consumer privacy laws. See the "State Consumer Privacy Rights and Disclosures" section below for more information.
Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Your PII may be shared between us and the companies with which we do business, and may also be disclosed to other entities that work with us or those companies to fulfill your request or to offer or provide other products and services to you.
We provide vehicle price quote and inquiry services and dealer communication services, including (i) our CarCode messaging service that enables emails, text and chats between a consumer and either a dealer or an Edmunds service provider, (ii) our vehicle trade-in and appraisal tools displayed on the Edmunds Automotive Network and dealer websites that enable a consumer to find our True Market Value® of a vehicle and that transmit such consumer's PII and that value to the dealer, (iii) dedicated dealer phone numbers displayed on the Edmunds Automotive Network, and (iv) our customer service department which, if a consumer contacts them, may act as an intermediary between such consumer and a dealer (collectively, "Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services").
If you use a Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service, we may use the phone number or email address that you use or provide to obtain or associate additional information about you. We keep copies of email, text and chat communications, and also may make and keep recordings of phone conversations between users of our Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services, including consumers and dealer personnel who communicate through our CarCode messaging service.

We may use whatever information we may have or know about you, including your PII, to customize or enhance your experience on the Edmunds Automotive Network (including the display of advertisements) and to provide, or communicate with you concerning, our products or services or those of companies with which we do business. We may use this information to optimize the manner in which the products or services you requested are operated and managed or to optimize the operation and management of other products and services. We may also use this information for purposes of reporting and analytics, including demonstrating to the companies with which we do business the effectiveness of our products and services.

Visitor Agreement
, or to take appropriate action if a visitor or other third party is determined by us to have violated that agreement, or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds or a parent company, the Edmunds Automotive Network, our visitors or other third parties (including, when applicable, consumers, dealers and manufacturers). In addition, we may disclose your PII to social media companies in a "hashed" (i.e., encoded) format that can only be recognized if you have an account with the recipient.
From time to time, we may also receive information requests for, and disclose to third parties, portions of the Edmunds Automotive Network's log files that show which "Internet service provider" a visitor has used or other visitor information; that information may enable third parties to discover, through that Internet service provider, the identity of a visitor.
Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

form. However, withdrawing your consent will not affect the rights of the other entities that previously received your PII to continue to send communications to you and otherwise use your PII, except as otherwise may be required under state consumer privacy law.
If you have registered on Edmunds.com, we may send you certain administrative and service messages in connection with the products and services available to you; you cannot opt out of receiving those communications, except as may be otherwise required under state consumer privacy or other United States law.

Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising
The cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (the "Program") was developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet. Edmunds has elected to implement the Program.
The Program applies to "online behavioral advertising," which is defined as the collection of data online from a particular computer or device regarding Web viewing behaviors over time, and across non-affiliate websites, for the purpose of using that data to predict visitor preferences or interests to deliver advertising to that computer or device based on the preferences or interests inferred from those Web viewing behaviors. (The Program does not apply to a website's collection of viewing behavior solely for its own uses, or to "contextual advertising" that delivers advertisements based on the content of a Web page, a search query or a visitor's contemporaneous behavior on a website.)
Our advertisers may from time to time use data collected about your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network and other websites to target ads to you on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other websites and online services.
In addition, the Edmunds Automotive Network may from time to time permit third parties to collect non-personally identifiable website usage information about our visitors for the purpose of facilitating the serving of targeted ads on other websites and online services. To do this, we permit those third parties to place and use cookies on the browsers of our visitors, and use Web beacons and other tracking technologies on the Edmunds Automotive Network. These third parties may also use personally identifiable information obtained from other sources to serve advertisements over time and across websites and online services.
Other companies' use of information collected through their cookies and other tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies and not this one. To learn more about your choices and how to opt out from receiving the types of ads described above, please

To actual or potential counterparties, and their representatives, counsel, advisors and agents, in connection with any merger by, or acquisition of, Edmunds or a parent company, or any sale or other transfer of assets by Edmunds or a parent company to another entity; and
To law enforcement; governmental entities; Edmunds' representatives, counsel, advisors and agents; and other third parties if Edmunds determines that disclosure of that information (i) is or may be required by law or legal process, or is requested by law enforcement or a governmental agency, (ii) is or may be reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds Automotive Network
Visitor Agreement
, or to take appropriate action if a visitor or other third party is determined by us to have violated that agreement, or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds or its parent company, the Edmunds Automotive Network, Edmunds' visitors or other third parties (including, when applicable, Consumers or Dealers)
Edmunds discloses User-Provided and Associated Identifiers to the Dealers whom you have selected or have vehicles that you have specified.  In some instances, Edmunds also sends User-Provided and Associated Identifiers to Manufacturers who granted franchises to those Dealers and/or those Manufacturers' contractors and agencies. This disclosure may be considered a "sale" under the laws of California and certain other Covered States' laws.
Edmunds may also disclose User-Provided Identifiers to service providers that work with us to fulfill requests you submit to us, to facilitate communications between Consumers and Dealers, or provide other products and services, and to social media companies in a "hashed" (i.e., encoded) format that can only be recognized if you have an account with the recipient. The disclosure to social media companies may be considered a "sale" under the laws of California and certain other Covered States laws even though we do not receive any monetary compensation from the social media companies in return for the information disclosed.
In addition, when you log into or associate one of your social media accounts with an Edmunds' Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service, Edmunds discloses certain User-Provided and Associated Identifiers to the social media provider of that account, and the dealer or consumer with which you are communicating may have access to those identifiers.
Edmunds discloses Internet Activity Data to Manufacturers for advertising purposes, to social networks for purposes of facilitating advertising on their platforms, to companies that place advertising on third party websites on behalf of Edmunds or its clients, and to companies who display advertising and/or provide targeted internet audience data and/or other services to advertisers or to companies that display advertising. Edmunds may disclose Internet Activity Data (together with User-Provided Identifiers) to companies that use that data to provide their own services to Dealers and Manufacturers.  Edmunds may also allow a vendor to collect Internet Activity Data to provide analytics services to Edmunds. The disclosures described above may be considered "sales" under California and other states' laws.
When you use Edmunds to obtain offers from third parties to purchase your vehicle, Edmunds sends your User-Provided Identifiers to the Dealers that make those offers and/or companies that obtain those offers from Dealers. When you use Edmunds to estimate the trade-in or sale value of your vehicle, Edmunds may also send your User-Provided Identifiers to Dealers who may be interested in your vehicle and this disclosure may be considered a "sale" or sharing for cross context behavioral advertising under California and certain other states' laws.
When you use an Edmunds product or service to calculate or obtain from Edmunds your estimated lease or loan payments for a vehicle offered by a Dealer for sale or lease -- and if you consent -- Edmunds transmits your Credit Information to a company that uses that information to obtain additional information about your credit from a credit reporting agency, which then sends Edmunds a transaction ID that allows Edmunds to collect your FICO score.  The credit reporting agency may make available to the Dealer offering that vehicle your FICO score and other credit information. In addition, Edmunds may disclose to that Dealer your self-reported approximate credit score, FICO score and estimated payment terms and may also advise that dealer either that Edmunds believes that you prequalify for those payment terms for that vehicle or that Edmunds did not have sufficient information to determine if you prequalify.
We retain the Personal Information we collect for as long as reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes disclosed at the point of collection or in this Privacy Statement or for other business purposes, unless a shorter or longer retention period is required by law or contract.  The length of retention may vary depending upon factors such as:
The existence of an ongoing relationship between you and us;
Recordkeeping or legal compliance requirements;
Service, product and network security and integrity purposes; and
The need to resolve inquiries or complaints
The following metrics are for the verifiable requests submitted by California Consumers during calendar year 2023:

Automated Collection of Data
When you visit or interact with our Online Services or open our emails, we may obtain certain information by automated means. CarMax may use a variety of technologies to collect this information, such as browser cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, server logs, and other technologies. A browser “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. These technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it; (2) track and understand how you use and interact with our Online Services and third-party digital services; (3) tailor our Online Services around your preferences; (4) measure the usability of our Online Services; (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications; (6) identify, diagnose and resolve technical issues; and (7) otherwise manage and enhance our Online Services, products and services.

Geolocation data
. When you use our Online Services, we may infer your location via your IP address or other information regarding your network connection. In addition, with your consent, our mobile device-ready website or mobile app (our “Mobile Services”) may collect precise information about the geographic location of your device. If your device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location. If you have consented using your device’s user interface, the geographic location of your device will be transmitted to our servers in real time any time that our mobile app is running(even if you are not actively using the app or it is minimized on your device). Once you set your device to transmit its location information to us, your device will continue to transmit its location information to us(when it is open) until you set your device to no longer do so.  You may at any time opt out from allowing us to have access to your device’s location information by accessing our app’s location settings on your device and setting your device not to share its location with us.

We collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps and devices, including from third-party websites and apps.

To decide what is relevant to you, we and certain third parties, such as our ad networks and other service providers, use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties.

We collect information about the people, pages, accounts, hashtags, and groups you are connected to, and how you interact with them across our products, such as the people you communicate with the most or the groups you are part of. We also collect information about how you use our products, including ads we serve on and off our products, such as the types of content you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, the people or accounts you interact with, and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities.

Partners, vendors and third parties:
Advertisers, app developers, and publishers and other partners can send us information for business purposes including through the Meta Business Tools they use, our social plugins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Meta pixel. These partners provide information about your activities on and off our products—including information about your device, websites you visit, apps you use, games you play, and purchases you make. We also receive information about your online and offline actions, and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. These partners collect your information when you visit their websites or use their services or through third parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have rights to collect, use, and disclose your information before providing any information to us. We also obtain information from publicly available sources, research institutions and professional and non-profit groups, including companies or organizations that provide content including videos, photos, or audio.
How long do we keep your Personal Information?
We keep Personal Information, including sensitive Personal Information, as long as we need it to provide our products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis.
Here’s what we consider when we decide:
If we need it to operate or provide our products.
The feature we use it for, and how that feature works.
How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations.
If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products.

To submit a request to exercise your rights, and as applicable, to appeal a consumer rights action, please visit this
webform
.
Here’s how you can exercise the right to opt out of targeted advertising:
For ads you see through Meta Products, visit the “Activity information from ad partners” section in
Ad Preferences
or visit the “Accounts” section in Accounts Center to control how your info is combined and used across your accounts, including for ads.
Depending on where you live, you may also see ads on other apps and websites about Meta Products or services which use your activity on Meta products to tailor the ad. If you have an account with Meta, you can control whether you see these ads when you visit the section titled “Ads about Meta” in
Ad Preferences
. If you do not have an account, you can use the
Digital Advertising Alliance
and/or the
NAI
industry opt-out platforms, along with your mobile device advertising settings offered by the device manufacturer. Certain ad blockers and tools to restrict cookies can interfere with your ability to opt out through the industry opt out platforms. Different device manufacturers provide different ways to opt out.
Depending on where you live, you may have the right to opt out of targeted advertising through a Global Privacy Control (GPC) enabled browser setting.  If you have this right, when you visit and log in to our websites in a GPC-enabled browser, we will treat our initial receipt of the GPC signal as a valid request to opt-out of targeted advertising, as defined by applicable U.S. privacy laws granting this right. Please note that if you are logged out, our processing of the signal will be limited to the specific browser that you are using. You may need to renew your opt‑out choice if you use a different browser to access our websites. Other than GPC, we do not recognize any "do not track" signals.
Please note that to protect your information and the integrity of our products, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In some cases, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as a government issued ID.
Under certain U.S. privacy laws, you may also designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may need to collect additional information, such as a government issued ID, to verify your identity before processing your request to protect your information. In most cases, we will facilitate your request through automated tools available through your password-protected account.
