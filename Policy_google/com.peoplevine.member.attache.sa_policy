Cancellation Policy:
For same-day reservations, we will promptly email guests to confirm their booking or allow them to update it in case of any changes to their plans.
For parties of 6 or more, credit card details are required to secure the reservation. Late cancellations (less than 24 hours in advance) or no-shows will incur a charge of SAR 250 per guest, payable via NINJA to confirm the booking.
No-Show Policy:
For the first no-show, guests will receive a follow-up email, expressing that we value their patronage and attention to future bookings.
If a guest misses three or more reservations, we will document this with a "history of no-show" tag in their profile. For future bookings, we will prioritize them for either the first or last seating, with no priority given for prime booking slots.
