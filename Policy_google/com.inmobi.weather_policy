              to approximate your location in order to provide the current
              weather and weather forecast in your general area. With your
              consent, we may collect precise location information when you
              first register for the Application or when you enable location
              services within your device settings. See
“Your Privacy Choices and Rights”
below to learn more.
Tracking Technologies.
We, as well as third
              parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality
              on our Services, may use SDKs, application program interfaces, a
              resettable device identifier from your device, and other similar
              technologies (“Technologies”), to automatically collect
              information through your use of our Services.
Cookies.
When you visit our website
                  using our mobile application, we utilize essential and
                  non-essential cookies to enhance user experience and provide
                  necessary functionalities. Essential cookies, served by our
                  domain, are crucial for accessing the website and delivering
                  requested services. Non-essential cookies, including analytics
                  cookies provided by Google Analytics and advertising/targeting
                  cookies served by Google Ads, help us understand website usage
                  patterns and tailor content to user interests. While essential
                  cookies are mandatory for the website to function, users have
                  the option to manage preferences for non-essential cookies
                  through
third-party cookie policies
. We encourage users to review and understand these policies
                  to make informed choices regarding their privacy preferences.
                  The use of such cookies may be subject to your consent in
                  accordance with the applicable law. For more information,
                  please review our
Cookie Policy
.
Resettable Device Identifiers.
Resettable Device
                  Identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar
                  to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (e.g.,
                  the "Identifier for Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices
                  and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain
                  streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers
                  are used to make online advertising more relevant and for analytics
                  and optimization purposes.
Pixel Tags.
A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon)
                  is a piece of code that may be embedded in our Services by our
                  Advertising Partners to collect information about engagement on
                  our Services. The pixel tag records, for example, that a user has
                  clicked on a particular advertisement.
Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general
                categories:
Operationally Necessary.
This includes Technologies
              that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that

              the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic
              practices to help us understand how individuals use our Services (see
              Analytics below);
Functionality-Related.
We may use Technologies that
              allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using

              Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests,
              or past items viewed;
Advertising- or Targeting-Related.

              first party or third-party Technologies to deliver content,

            third-party application, such as an app store, a third-party login

            about you from that third-party application that you have made
            available via your privacy settings.

Tracking Technologies.
We, as well as third
              parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality

Cookies.
When you visit our website
                  using our mobile application, we utilize essential and
                  non-essential cookies to enhance user experience and provide
                  necessary functionalities. Essential cookies, served by our
                  domain, are crucial for accessing the website and delivering
                  requested services. Non-essential cookies, including analytics
                  cookies provided by Google Analytics and advertising/targeting
                  cookies served by Google Ads, help us understand website usage
                  patterns and tailor content to user interests. While essential
                  cookies are mandatory for the website to function, users have
                  the option to manage preferences for non-essential cookies
                  through
third-party cookie policies
. We encourage users to review and understand these policies
                  to make informed choices regarding their privacy preferences.
                  The use of such cookies may be subject to your consent in
                  accordance with the applicable law. For more information,
                  please review our
Cookie Policy
.
Resettable Device Identifiers.
Resettable Device
                  Identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar
                  to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (e.g.,
                  the "Identifier for Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices
                  and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain
                  streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers
                  are used to make online advertising more relevant and for analytics
                  and optimization purposes.
Pixel Tags.
A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon)
                  is a piece of code that may be embedded in our Services by our
                  Advertising Partners to collect information about engagement on
                  our Services. The pixel tag records, for example, that a user has
                  clicked on a particular advertisement.
Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general
                categories:
Operationally Necessary.
This includes Technologies
              that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that
              are required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent
              activity, improve security, or allow you to make use of our functionality;
Performance-Related.
We may use Technologies to assess
              the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic
              practices to help us understand how individuals use our Services (see
              Analytics below);
Functionality-Related.
We may use Technologies that
              allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using
              our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our
              Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests,
              or past items viewed;
Advertising- or Targeting-Related.
We may use
              first party or third-party Technologies to deliver content,

            without limitation advertising companies, advertisers, ad networks,
            device manufacturers or carriers or telecom partners issuing smart
            devices, other application developers, third-party services and
            organizations. For example, if you access our Services through a
            third-party application, such as an app store, a third-party login
            service, or a social networking site, we may collect information
            about you from that third-party application that you have made
            available via your privacy settings.
Referrals and Sharing Features.
Our Services may offer
            various tools and functionalities that allow you to provide information
            about your friends through our referral service; third parties may also
            use these services to upload information about you. Our referral services
