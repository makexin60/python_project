What technologies does Truist use?
Truist and its online advertising and marketing partners may employ various technologies to collect information, including:
Cookies –
Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on your device. Cookies provide information that is used for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize/customize your online experience. The cookies Truist uses do not collect or store any personally identifiable information about you. Truist uses persistent cookies to learn how visitors use our site, such as which pages are viewed the most, to identify the most common navigation paths, or to customize the presentation of information on the site. Truist also uses session cookies to assist in delivering some online transactions, like online banking. Session cookies are no longer active after you log off the service that initiated them, and all session cookies are automatically deleted when you close all browser windows. Truist may also contract with third parties, including, but not limited to, Adobe (see Cross-Device Tracking, below), to track user activity on our website. You can choose to block or disable these cookies as most devices and browsers offer their own privacy settings.  Doing so, however, may result in diminished performance on our site.
Marketing pixels, web beacons, clear GIFs, or other technologies –
This technology may be placed on certain pages of our website, applications, emails, and other marketing initiatives. These tags usually work in conjunction with cookies and allow us to measure the effectiveness of our site and compile statistics about usage and response rates.
Software Development Kits (SDKs) –
Our mobile applications may include third-party SDKs that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your mobile app activity. In addition, some mobile devices come with a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple’s IDFA and Google’s Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, may allow us and our service providers to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes in compliance with applicable app store consent rules.
Advertising and Cross-Device Tracking –
Truist uses certain Adobe Analytics services and products, which help companies build websites, applications, and advertisements that seamlessly flow between all your devices (such as a desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, or smart watch). The Adobe services recognize which of your devices are linked through use of technology that includes cookies and your IP address (without collecting your sensitive personal information). Visit the
Adobe website
, opens in new tab
for more information on opting out of certain services, cross-device tracking, and/or to unlink your devices. NOTE: Adobe needs to install a cookie on your browser to identify that you have opted out. If you delete the opt-out cookie, or change devices or web browsers, you will need to opt out again.
Firewalls, passcodes, data encryption, and other safety features –
Truist uses these technologies to help secure the information you provide to us. To learn more about how we safeguard your information online, please visit our
Truist fraud and security
center for measures you can take to protect yourself.
Third-party plugins –
Other companies may have plugins that appear on certain pages of our website or applications. Some of these, for example, may be from social media companies (for example, the Facebook “Like” button). These plugins may collect information, such as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the company that created the plugin even if you do not click on the plugin. These third-party plugins and the way they operate are governed by the privacy policies and terms of the companies that created them.
How does Truist interact with me online?
Online advertising on Truist websites and applications
Truist advertises its products and services on pages within our sites and on mobile applications. To make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, Truist may target and personalize content and advertisements for products and services on our site and within Online Banking (when clients sign on or off to online accounts with their user ID/password).
If you would prefer to not receive a specific   advertisement, content or offers on Truist authenticated (after signing in) pages, you can click “No Thanks” to the specific pop-up ad you’re being presented. Note that this will not prevent you from potentially receiving other ads, content, or offers for a different product or service. Also note that simply closing the pop-up message by clicking on the “X” will not register that you do not wish to receive this specific message again. You can control some of the ways we share and use your information by managing preferences by visiting the
Truist Privacy Center
.
Online advertising on third-party websites and applications
Truist advertises its products and services on websites and applications not affiliated with Truist. The third-party companies we hire to display these ads use their own tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your interests. Many of our third-party partners have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review these policies carefully.
Some of our third-party advertising is interest-based and may use information about your online interests to customize the online ads you see. To opt out of having your online behavior collected and used for advertising purposes, go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Choices page at
www.aboutads.info/choices
, opens in new tab
. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific. To conduct a DAA Webchoices Browser Check, visit the
DAA Choices
, opens in new tab
webpage. Anyone receiving an interest-based ad can click on the displayed icon to receive more information. This opt-out does not prevent you from receiving advertisements; instead, it allows you to control whether you receive interest-based advertisements and from which companies. For additional options, you may also visit
NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising
, opens in new tab
.
Third-party aggregation services and tools
Aggregation allows you to gather information from many websites and view that information in a consolidated format. An example of why you might use a third-party aggregation tool is if you wanted a comprehensive view of assets and liabilities held within your financial accounts. If you provide information about your Truist accounts (including your access information) to an aggregation service provider, we will consider that as your having authorized all transactions initiated by that aggregation site. Truist reserves the right to disable aggregation for any account without notice. If you wish to cancel your third-party aggregation services, you should also change your password at Truist.com.
Social media
Truist provides experiences on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, or Twitter that enable online sharing and collaboration. We use social media to facilitate social engagement and sharing, when such sharing is appropriate and safe. Read more about Truist and social media
terms and conditions here
. Please note, any content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those platforms. Please refer to them to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.
Given the very public nature of social media, it is critical that we all safeguard confidential financial information. If you post information on a Truist site that we feel should be shielded from public view, we will remove it. This includes not only specific details about your Truist accounts and other private, confidential information (such as your Social Security number), but details of information relayed in private conversations between you and Truist representatives. Please know that in taking down or editing your posts, we are focusing our experience and best judgment to keep your personal information safe.
Email
Email transmitted across the internet is normally not protected and may be intercepted and viewed by others. Therefore, you should refrain from sending any confidential or private information via unsecured email to Truist. We'll never ask you to send confidential information to us via email, such as your logon ID, password, full account numbers, or Social Security number. To help secure your communications with us, use Secure Messaging in online banking.
Occasionally, we will retain the content of your email—and our replies—to confirm proper responses to your questions and requests, to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to ensure that we consistently deliver an enjoyable client experience to you.
Linking to other sites
Truist may provide links to non-Truist companies, such as credit bureaus or merchants, and will notify you when leaving the Truist site. If you choose to link to websites not controlled by Truist, we are not responsible for the privacy or security of these sites, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability or suitability of their information. If you are asked to provide information on one of these sites, we urge you to carefully study their privacy policies before sharing.

Consumer Rights Under the CCPA
Right to Know / See Data Request
You have the right to request that Truist disclose categories or specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you over the last 12 months, the categories of sources from which that information was collected, the business or commercial purpose(s) for which the information was collected, sold, or shared with third parties for cross context behavioral advertising, and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.
Right to Correct
You have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information maintained by Truist.  In many instances, such updates are best made by logging into your online account or employee portals, calling 1-844-4TRUIST, or visiting a branch, and some corrections may require specific documentation to be provided as required by law. If you provide us documentation, it will only be used or maintained for the purpose of correcting the information and complying with our recordkeeping requirements under the CCPA. Truist also provides the
Privacy Center
and privacy request line as described below.
Right to Delete
You have the right to request deletion of personal information that Truist has collected, subject to certain exceptions. For example, we may deny your request if retaining the information is necessary for us to complete a transaction you requested or comply with our legal obligations.
Submitting a Verified Consumer Request
Consumers are welcome to submit right to know, correction, or deletion requests by visiting our
Privacy Center
, opens in new tab
or by calling
888-294-2265
, opens in new tab
.
All requests must be verified prior to receiving a response, using Truist authentication protocols. Requesters will be asked to supply certain basic personal information to enable us to verify the request against our records, such as name, Social Security number, and address. Information submitted for verification purposes will only be used to verify the requestor’s identity and/or authority to make a request on another’s behalf.
Requests made on another person’s behalf can only be accepted upon receipt of documentation that the requestor is an authorized agent, parent, or legal guardian of the consumer whose information is being requested. This will require the submission of a valid Power of Attorney, Birth Certificate, approved Truist authorization form, Guardianship Order, or other court order granting authority to receive information, as appropriate.
Upon submission of a request, consumers will receive an initial confirmation of receipt within 10 days. We will respond to your request within 45 days (unless an extension of up to 45 additional days is requested, upon which the consumer will receive notice and an explanation for the extension).
Please note Truist is also a service provider to business clients and may not fulfill requests pertaining to personal information we process on their behalf. For example, we offer payroll services to small businesses or payment processing services to retail merchants. If you are an employee, customer, representative, or otherwise associated with one of these clients, we encourage you to reach out to the business directly to exercise your rights specific to this information.
Opt Out Preference Signals
Your internet browser may give you more control over your privacy preferences via a Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. This is a setting in your browser that notifies the websites you visit of your preferences to opt out of selling or sharing your personal information under California law. If you have opted out via the GPC signal, Truist sites will recognize this signal and process your preference automatically as it pertains to tags, cookies and pixels that collect personal information when you visit Truist.com. Please note, you will need to enable the signal on each browser that you use, as the signal is processed at the browser-level and is not applied if you visit Truist.com from a different browser or device that does not have the GPC signal enabled.  When you have authenticated into Truist Privacy Center from a browser with GPC enabled, Truist will automatically apply that opt out preference to offline data that we have about you. To opt out without GPC enabled, see the section Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale/Sharing above.
Non-Discrimination
The submission of any CCPA request will have no impact on the service and/or pricing you receive from Truist. It will not result in any denial of goods or services, or different prices, rates or quality of goods or services, nor will it result in retaliation against an employee, applicant, or independent contractor.

Truist products and services are not intended for consumers under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 without consent. Truist does not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under the age of 16 or share such information for cross-contextual advertising.
