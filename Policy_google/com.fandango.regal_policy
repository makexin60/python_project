We may request additional information to support your use of the Services, such as a profile picture, username, password or identification. We also collect any information that you voluntarily enter into any postings, comments or forums within the Services, including any messages you send to other users of the Services. If you send an e-mail to us, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files and other information you choose to provide to us.

The information we obtain from such third-party services depends on your account/privacy settings with those third parties and the third parties’ privacy policies, so be sure to check those policies and to adjust your settings to meet your preferences. When you access the Services through social media networks and other third-party platforms, you are authorizing REG to collect, store and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please keep in mind that any information provided to us by a third party may also be subject to that third party’s privacy policy. When other customers buy you a gift, they may provide us with your name, email address or other personal information.

We engage service providers to perform a variety of services and functions for us, such as storing data, transmitting emails, delivering ads or marketing communications, hosting events, and managing digital content. We may share any of the information we collect with such service providers, including service providers located outside the United States, subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and on the condition that the service providers use your information only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
To comply with legal requirements and to protect you, us, and others:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to retain and disclose your information at our discretion if we believe in good faith that such retention and disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas, warrants or similar process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties; or (c) ensure the safety and security of our Services, systems and customers and of third parties.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy and that the new entity may continue to process your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
For advertising and marketing:
We may, as permitted by law, share personal information with trusted partners that may use the information to advertise products and services that may be of interest to you within all Regal’s properties and you may opt-out by submitting your request to privacy@regalcinemas.com.  (Note:  For Corporate Box Office customers who created accounts prior to 8.01.23, we disclose information for these purposes subject to your consent.)

If you do not agree or do not consent to the disclosure of your information in any manner described above, you should not use the Services or interact with us.
Text Messaging
By opting in to receive text messages on your mobile device, you consent to receive autodialed, telemarketing text messages at the applicable phone number, including Short Message Service (SMS) messages. By opting in, you accept and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the
Regal SMS Terms and Conditions
.
Augmented Reality
Our app offers Augmented Reality (AR) experiences which uses your phone’s TrueDepth camera (if your phone has this) to detect faces, on which a virtual facemask can be placed. To use this feature you will need to allow the use of your camera by the app, which you can disallow at any time. All AR images taken with your mobile phone camera are processed solely on your device, and AR data is not stored or shared by us, and is only used during that AR session.
Children's Guidelines
REG does not target the online Services to children under 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13 you may use our online Services only with the consent and under the supervision of a parent or guardian. Please note that our online Services may contain links to content providers that collect information from children under the age of 13. We have no control over such content providers and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites or applications. Because the Internet offers open access to a wide range of information, it is important that parents supervise content, e-mail and chat sessions. If you become aware that your child has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@regalcinemas.com.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
Our online Services use cookies (including HTTP cookies and flash cookies), web beacons, and pixel tags for many purposes, including to keep track of your favorite locations, deliver content specific to your interests, save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Services, learn about how you interact with the Services, and deliver targeted advertising.
Cookies
are lines of text that are transmitted to your web browser when you click on a Service. They provide a way for a server to recall a previous request or previous registration so that information does not have to be re-entered. Your browser stores the information on your hard drive and when you return to that Service later, the cookie is transmitted back only to the servers that originally sent it to you. A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other information that directly identifies you, such as phone number or address; however, we may link the information obtained through cookies to other personally identifying information to give us a better understanding of your preferences and provide a more meaningful experience to you through our Services. You can configure your browser to alert you when a site is attempting to send you a cookie. You can decline the collection of cookies in most browsers. If you set your browser to decline cookies, some features of the Services may not work properly. Consult your browser's “Help” function for more information.
We may use authorized third-party service providers to provide us with analytical data about your use of the Services. We may deploy devices, such as cookies, that enable those third parties to collect and aggregate usage information and report it back to us. We and our partners may also use third-party vendors, such as Google Display Advertising, to support our marketing efforts and those of our partners. REG, our partners, and these third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the
Google Analytics
cookie), third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie), and other web beacons and pixel tags together to inform, optimize, and serve ads across the internet. We and our partners may combine the information we collect with other information about you to show you potentially relevant and useful ads. Please note that if you
opt out
of targeted advertising, you may still see other non-targeted ads on our Services and across the web. Additionally, we may still use cookies to optimize our Services and for security purposes. Advertisers, partners and other third parties that serve ads on our Services may also use their own cookies. These cookies collect their own information independent of REG's activities. You can
disable this cookie
capability as described above.
Security
We maintain safeguards to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of any user information under our control. Please be aware that the transmission of information over the Internet is not inherently secure, and although we endeavor to provide reasonable security measures, no security systems can prevent all potential security breaches.
Your Choices
If you use one of our mobile applications, you can stop all collection of information by the application by uninstalling the application from your mobile device. You can also withdraw your consent to receive “push” notifications and/or to the collection of your physical location information from your mobile device at any time by disabling or changing the related functionality or setting in your mobile device.
You have the choice to opt out of receiving marketing communications from us. You may opt out by e-mailing our customer service department at privacy@regalcinemas.com. Please note that it may take us a few days (but no longer than 10 business days) to update our systems, and during this period you may still receive marketing communications from us. You can also opt out of receiving text messages at any time by texting STOP to 61633 from your mobile device. If you request to opt out of receiving text messages, we may send you a one-time opt-out confirmation text message. If you would like to update the personal information you have provided to us, please contact us at privacy@regalcinemas.com. (If you are a Regal Crown Club member, please note that you can update certain personal information in your account via our website or mobile application.)

PayPal Privacy Statement
Last updated on February 13, 2025
Overview
PayPal, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “PayPal”) provides this Privacy Statement to describe our use of your Personal Information when you use your PayPal account, Xoom account, visit our websites, or apply for, or use our Services, like Braintree and Zettle. This Privacy Statement does not apply to Excluded Services, such as Venmo and Hyperwallet.
We encourage you to read this Privacy Statement and to use it to help you make informed decisions.
Certain capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in the Statement are explained in the
Definitions
section below.
We revise this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes to our business, Services, or applicable laws. If the revised version requires notice in accordance with applicable law, we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the change on the "
Policy Updates
" or "
Privacy Statement
" page of our website, otherwise the revised Privacy Statement will be effective as of the published effective date. If you are a new User or are receiving this Privacy Statement for the first time and there is an upcoming change described on the
Policy Updates
or Privacy Statement page at the time you receive this Privacy Statement, such upcoming change will apply to you on the indicated effective date.
For most of our Services, we act as a “data controller” or “business”, however there are some products and features where PayPal may also act as a “data processor” or “service provider” when providing services to our Partners and Merchants.  The “data controller” or “business” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that has the control over the purposes and means by which the data processing is performed.  The “data processor” or “service provider” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that processes the Personal Information for the data controller, for the data controller’s specific purposes, and as otherwise permitted under applicable data protection laws.
Non-Account Holders and Fastlane Profile Users
Our Services may be accessed by individuals without a PayPal or Xoom account. We will collect Personal Information from you even if you are a non-account holder when you use our Services, such as when you use our Pay Without a PayPal account, use Unbranded Payment Services (e.g., Braintree and Zettle), use a Fastlane profile, or when a non-accountholder receives a payment through the Visa+ service from a PayPal account holder (“Recipient”). If you Pay Without a PayPal account, we may link your transaction information with your PayPal account, if you have one at the time you use the Service without logging in, or if you create a PayPal account later.
With a Fastlane profile, individuals can store their payment methods and other Personal Information with PayPal so that they can complete the checkout process faster,  create a store or loyalty account, or facilitate other transactions at participating Partners and Merchants with payment card, contact information, shipping data or other data they save in their Fastlane profile as relevant to the specific interaction, participating Partner or Merchant, all without having to manually input payment method details and other Personal Information each time they checkout ("Fastlane").
When you create a Fastlane profile, you are agreeing to let PayPal store your Personal Information, including your name, email, phone number, address information, billing information and payment method details, and other data that may be relevant to specific Partner or Merchant interactions, and pre-populate that information in the checkout flows or other interactive features of participating Partners and Merchants so that you can  enjoy a faster Partner and Merchant experience by not having to manually input  your payment or other information. We will also collect transaction and other Partner or Merchant data related to your purchases and other Partner or Merchant interactions when you use Fastlane. If you have a Fastlane profile, we may recognize you as a Fastlane user when you shop on the participating Partners’ and Merchants’ sites, and we may prompt you to engage in participating Partner or Merchant interactions, such as registering for a store or loyalty account using your Fastlane profile information. If you choose to interact with participating Partners or Merchants through Fastlane, you agree to let PayPal disclose your Fastlane profile information to the Participating Partners and Merchants and their service providers, and to facilitate your transaction and shopping experience on the participating Partners and Merchants sites.
The Visa+ Service enables eligible customers with a PayPal account to send and receive money to and from Venmo and third-party Visa+-enabled digital wallets (“Visa+”).
When you shop on Partner and Merchant sites, the Partner or Merchant may disclose Personal Information with PayPal that we will use in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the relevant PayPal user agreement.

Your Data Protection Rights
Your rights to access, correction, deletion, and restriction to use or share your Personal Information.
Under applicable data protection law, depending upon the jurisdiction in which you reside and subject to applicable exceptions and definitional differences among various state laws, you may have certain rights about how your Personal Information is collected, stored, used and shared.
We recognize the importance of your ability to control the use of your Personal Information and provide several ways for you to exercise your rights to access (right to know your information), right to know third-parties to which we have disclosed Personal Information, correction, deletion (erasure), and to restrict certain information (right to opt-out of sharing and right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information).
Certain state laws also provide residents of those states with the right to opt out of the “sale” (disclosing Personal Information in exchange for money or other consideration) or “sharing” (disclosing Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising) of your Personal Information or use of your Personal Information for certain types of targeted advertising.  Global Privacy Control settings is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. PayPal does not respond to the Global Privacy Control signal because we do not sell or share your data.
We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights; although, certain personalized services for PayPal customers may not provide the same level of personalization with limited data sharing. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we handle your
Privacy Rights
.

Contact Information
section.
We’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.

To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function.
For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.
Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information
If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.
You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.
Choose what we disclose with other Users
Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.
Choose what we share with Partners and Merchants for Personalized Shopping
Unless we are required by law to obtain your consent, we share Personal Information collected after November 27, 2024 (or from earlier if you consent) for personalized shopping experiences. Personal Information we disclose includes, for example, products, preferences, sizes, and styles we think you’ll like. To opt-out of Personal Information sharing with Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences, log into your PayPal account and edit your preferences in the Data and Privacy setting. If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.
Choose how we communicate with you
Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Fastlane profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.
You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal or Fastlane marketing email, opt-out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.
You won’t be able to opt-out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account or Fastlane profile's status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.
How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?
We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and account/Fastlane profile registration information and verifying that the Personal Information we maintain about you is accurate and current. We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that we share with a third-party based on a linked account connection that you have authorized.
Can Children Use Our Services?
We do not knowingly collect information, including Personal Information, from children under the age of 13 or other individuals who are not legally allowed to use our Services. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Information from someone not allowed to use our Services, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data.
Please
contact us
if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from someone not allowed to use our Services.
We do not sell to third parties for money, or share Personal Information of anyone under 16 years of age, for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising.

CCPA California Notice at Collection
Most of the Personal Information we collect is subject to federal and state privacy laws that apply to financial institutions. To the extent the Personal Information is not subject to these federal and state financial privacy laws and to the extent it is collected in California about California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may apply. The following section pertains only to Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA (“CCPA personal information”) and makes statements that reference unique definitions and requirements of law.
This CCPA California Notice at Collection describes: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “CCPA personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose CCPA personal information for a business purpose, and/or (b) “share” CCPA personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or (c) “sell” such CCPA personal information, as applicable.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the sharing or disclosure of CCPA personal information by a business to a third party, for the targeting of advertising to a consumer, based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s CCPA activity across businesses, websites, applications, or services, other than those with which a consumer uses or directs a business to internally disclose CCPA personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties. “Selling” is defined as the disclosure of CCPA personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, but does not apply to such disclosures when a consumer uses or directs a business to intentionally disclose CCPA personal information or interact with one or more third parties.
We do not sell or share your CCPA personal information, including any Sensitive CCPA personal information, outside the exceptions.
We also do not sell or share, and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any CCPA personal information of anyone under 16 years of age.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose CCPA personal information, please see the “Categories of Personal Information We Collect”, “How is Personal Information used,” and “Do We Disclose Personal Information” sections.
