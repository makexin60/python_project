The processing of personal data to respond to users who contact CIVITATIS by any means regarding their requests for information, requests, queries and complaints is based on the consent of the person concerned, unless said complaint, query, request or request for information is made by a client by virtue of the services contracted, in which case the legitimate basis will be that reflected in the general conditions applicable to them.

These providers access your data following our instructions and without being able to use them for a different purpose and maintaining the strictest confidentiality on the basis of a contract in which they undertake to comply with the requirements of the current regulations on personal data protection.

Data Privacy Framework agreement
.
CIVITATIS uses the Sendgrid platform to send transactional communications related to the services provided, as well as for communications to Accommodations, Affiliates, Agencies and Providers.

However, this entity offers adequate data protection guarantees as it has signed the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (SCC). You can find more information
here
, as well as a copy of the content of the SCC in Annex 3 of its
Data Protection Addendum

When you download the CIVITATIS mobile app, you’ll be asked for permission to access your location in order to show you activities near you. This processing is based on your consent, which you can revoke at any time by disabling location access in the CIVITATIS app. Location processing is not necessary for using the app, but without it, we won’t be able to show you nearby activities.
10.- What are your rights when you provide us with your data?
You have the right to confirm whether we are processing your personal data and to access your personal data, request correction of inaccurate data, or request its deletion when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes collected.
Under conditions provided in the General Data Protection Regulation, you may request the restriction of processing or portability of your data, in which case we will only retain it for the assertion or defense of claims.
In certain circumstances and for reasons related to your particular situation, you may object to the processing of your data. If you have consented to processing for specific purposes, you are entitled to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the legality of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. In these cases, we will stop processing the data or, if applicable, stop doing so for that specific purpose, except for compelling legitimate reasons, or the assertion or defense of possible claims.
Additionally, data protection regulations allow you to object to being the subject of decisions based solely on the automated processing of your data, where applicable.
These rights are characterized as follows:
- They are exercised free of charge, unless the requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (e.g., repetitive), in which case a fee proportional to the administrative costs incurred may be charged, or the request may be refused.
- You can exercise these rights directly or through a legal or voluntary representative.
- We must respond to your request within one month, but this period may be extended by two more months if necessary, considering the complexity and number of requests.
- We are obligated to inform you about the means to exercise these rights, which must be accessible and cannot deny you the right for the sole reason of choosing another method. If the request is made by electronic means, the information will be provided by these means when possible, unless you request otherwise.
- If for any reason, your request is not acted upon, we will inform you no later than one month after the reasons for this and the possibility of filing a complaint with a Supervisory Authority.
To facilitate the exercising of these rights, we have provided links below to the request form for each right:
-
Right of access form
-
Right to rectification form
-
Right to object form
-
Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") form
-
Right to restriction of processing form
-
Right to data portability form
-
Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing form
All the aforementioned rights can be exercised through the means of contact listed at the beginning.
In the event of any violation of your rights, especially when you have not obtained satisfaction in the exercising of your rights, you can file a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (contact details available at www.aepd.es), or other competent supervisory authority. You can also obtain more information about your rights by contacting these bodies.
11.- How do we protect your personal data?
We are firmly committed to protecting the personal data we process. We use reasonably reliable and effective physical, organizational, and technological measures, controls, and procedures aimed at preserving the integrity and security of your data and ensuring your privacy.
Additionally, all personnel with access to personal data have been trained and are aware of their obligations concerning the processing of personal data.
In the contracts we enter into with our service providers, we include clauses that require them to maintain confidentiality regarding the personal data to which they have access due to the engagement, as well as to implement the necessary technical and organizational security measures to ensure the permanent confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of personal data processing systems and services.
All these security measures are periodically reviewed to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness.
However, absolute security cannot be guaranteed, and no security system is impenetrable. Therefore, in the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a security breach, we will take appropriate measures to investigate the incident, notify the Supervisory Authority, and, if applicable, inform those users who may have been affected so they can take appropriate action.
12.- What is your responsibility as the data subject?
By providing us with your personal data, you guarantee that you are over 14 years of age and that the data provided is true, accurate, complete and up-to-date.
For these purposes, you are responsible for the accuracy of the data and you must keep it properly updated to reflect your current situation, making you responsible for false and inaccurate data that you provide, as well as damages, direct or indirect, that may arise.
If you provide data regarding third parties, you assume the responsibility of informing them in advance of all provisions set forth in Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation under the conditions established in that provision.
13.- How did we obtain your data?
In the cases in which the user registration is made through social media, the personal data that we will process will come from the social network in question, to which, previously, the interested party will have provided such data for the purposes set out in their privacy policies. The categories of data that we will collect from the social network in question are those that appear on our registration form and that you have provided to that social network. If, in order to proceed with the registration on our website, more data than those provided by the social network are essential, you must additionally complete them in our registration form, subject to the privacy conditions set forth in this Policy.
With respect to the purchase of a CIVITATIS gift card, the data of the recipient of the same, if applicable, are provided by the purchaser when filling out the corresponding form, providing the contact data indicated therein: name and e-mail address. The buyer is responsible for having the authorization of the recipient prior to providing their data to CIVITATIS.
Finally, sometimes, the data of the final customers may be provided by the agency that proceeds to the contracting of the experience offered by CIVITATIS on their behalf, so that the contracted services can be offered, as indicated in the
General Conditions of Use
