            doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
Third-party Personal Data
                    processor.
We may use service providers to process Personal Data on our
                    behalf. This processing is for several purposes, including for example sending out marketing
                    material. Third party service providers are bound by confidentiality clauses and are not allowed to
                    use Personal Data for other purposes.
Payment providers and (other) financial
                    institutions.
We may need to share certain booking details with the
                    payment service provider and the relevant financial institution to do payments or to handle the

services via third party business partners (to ensure relevant advertisements are shown

                    address. We strive to only share email addresses in a hashed form so they can be matched to an
                    existing customer database. We strive not to share email addresses for any other purpose. For more

.  Cookies
9
.1 A cookie is a small amount of
            data that is placed in the browser of the User’s computer or on his/her mobile device. So-called
            “first party cookies” (not as much fun as they sound) are cookies which are served by the entity
            operating the domain through which the cookie is served. The Service
’
own cookies are therefore “first party cookies”.
            In case we allow others to service cookies through the Service, these cookies are so-called “third
            party cookies”.
In addition, there is a difference between session cookies
            and permanent cookies. Session cookies will only exist until the User closes his/her browser. Permanent
            cookies have a longer lifespan and are not automatically deleted once the User closes the browser. We strive
            to serve cookies or allow the serving of cookies with a maximum lifespan of 5 years. Only in exceptional
            circumstances, such as for security purposes and where absolutely necessary, will a cookie have a longer
            lifespan than that.
Next to cookies, other tracking technologies are used which
            are similar to cookies. These can include web beacons (also known as pixel tags, web bugs or gifs), tracking
            URLs or software development kits (SDKs). A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that can be
            delivered to the User’s computer as part of a web page request, in an app, in an advertisement or in
            an HTML email message. Pixels can be used to retrieve information from the User’s device, such as the
            device type or operating system, IP address, and time of visit. They are also used to serve and read cookies
            in the browser. Tracking URLs are used to understand from which referring Service the Service is used. SDKs
            are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons. All these
            technologies are hereinafter together referred to in this section as
“Cookies”
.
9.2. Important information.
We allow third parties with which we have a separate
            agreement to use Cookies and other technologies to collect information about the User’s use of the
            Service. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when the User views or
            interacts with one of their advertisements on the Service; and (2) advertising networks, which collect
            information about the User’s interests when he/she views or interacts with one of their
            advertisements.
The information gathered by these third parties is used to
            make predictions about the User’s interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or
            promotional material on the Service and on other sites across the Internet tailored to the User’s
            apparent interests.
The business partners and advertising networks that serve
            interest-based advertisements have limited access to a small amount of information about the User’s
            profile and device, which is necessary to serve the User advertisements that are tailored to his/her
            apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or
            services.
We do not share with these third parties any information that
            would readily identify the User (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to
            information about the User’s device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control
            over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about the User’s
            interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Policy. Other than
            as discussed in this Policy, we have no control over these third parties.
10. Minors and children’s privacy
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially
            important. Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect
            Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 18
            years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that
            Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable
            parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or
            guardian and discover that your child under 18 years of age has obtained an Account on the Service, then you
            may alert us at pd@emergingtravel.com
and request that
            we delete that child’s Personal Data from our systems

            deletion or removal options detailed in this Privacy Policy. If you have any question regarding this topic,
            please contact us as indicated in the section “How to Contact Us” section. Please be aware that,

            accordance with GDPR requirements and within the legal time frame.
Please note that these rights are subject to certain
            exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention of crime) and our interests (e.g., the
            maintenance of legal privilege). Where such exemptions apply, we will communicate them to you along with the
            reasons for the decision.
12. Data Security and Retention
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect
            the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate
            administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful
            destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any
            other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example,
            firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to
            encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security
            features to further anonymize Personal Data.
If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform the
            User and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.
In accordance with European data protection laws, we observe
            reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access to, and the misuse of, Personal Data. Only authorized
            personnel are permitted to access personal data in the course of their work.
We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as
            long as the User’s Personal Account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we
            need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law.
13. Changes and Updates to this Policy

            changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it
            available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable
            law. The User’s continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates
            that the User has read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.
