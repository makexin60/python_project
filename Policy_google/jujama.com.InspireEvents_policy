4. Complaint Filing Procedure
4.1. Prior Good Faith Attempt to Resolve Complaint.
The Complainant must make a good faith effort to resolve his dispute directly with the Participant before filing the Complaint with VeraSafe.

If VeraSafe determines, in its sole discretion, that Complainant did not make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute before filing a Complaint, VeraSafe shall require the Complainant to try to resolve the Complaint directly with the Participant and shall advise the Complainant that he or she may re-file the Complaint using the Procedure, as outlined herein, if the attempt to resolve the Complaint with the Participant does not yield satisfactory results.
4.2. Information Required.
A Complainant must provide certain information to VeraSafe in order to successfully file a Complaint with the Procedure. Therefore, the Complaint must:
allege a Participant’s failure to comply with the Framework(s);
include the fullest possible account of facts and events giving rise to the Complaint;
seek one or more of the Permitted Outcomes (see Section 5.1);
if any damages or harm is alleged, include specific details of the harm and/or damages (where applicable, quantification of monetary damages is preferred, but not required);

include consent to share the Complaint with the Participant;
include all available documentation to support the Complaint;
include a description of Complainant’s good faith effort to resolve the dispute with the Participant, before filing the Complaint; and

Within ten business days of receiving the Complaint, VeraSafe will inform the Complainant if the Complaint fails to meet any of the requirements enumerated in Section 4.2 and will give the Complainant the opportunity to amend the Complaint to satisfy such requirement(s). As a matter of course, the Complainant will have two opportunities to amend the Complaint for failure to address any defects in the Complaint. Further opportunities to amend the Complaint to satisfy the requirements of Section 4.2 shall be given solely at VeraSafe’s discretion.

Procedure Submissions shall be considered delivered to the recipient immediately upon their electronic transmission by the sender.
5. Permitted Outcomes
5.1.
The
Parties agree that the possible outcomes that a Complainant may seek via the Procedure, and the maximum relief that VeraSafe shall assign in a Data Privacy Hearing or Appellate Hearing during the Procedure, are limited to the non-exclusive remedies described below (the “Permitted Outcomes”). Permitted Outcomes are only those that may
require:
the effects of noncompliance with the Framework(s) to be reversed or corrected by the Participant;
that future data processing by the Participant be in conformity with the Framework(s);
the Participant to cease processing PII of the Complainant;
the Participant to delete relevant PII that was processed contrary to the Framework(s);
the temporary suspension and/or removal of Participant’s license to display VeraSafe Seal(s);
the Participant to compensate the Complainant for actual, direct losses incurred as a result of Participant’s non-compliance with the Framework(s); or
the Participant to comply with any orders set forth by the Hearing Officer or Appeal Officer
5.2.
In order to ensure that any sanctions are sufficiently rigorous – in accordance with Supplemental Principle 11(e)(i) of the Data Privacy Framework – VeraSafe reserves the right to impose additional sanctions upon the Participant that are more severe than those sought by the Complainant in situations where VeraSafe determines that such requested sanctions are inadequate to ensure Participant’s compliance with the Framework(s); provided, however, that the fulfillment of the Complainant’s desired outcome(s) shall be satisfied, at minimum.
6. Complaint Response Procedure
6.1. Participant’s Response to Complaint.
Complaints that VeraSafe determines to be eligible shall be forwarded by VeraSafe to the Participant. The Participant must file its response to the Complaint (“Response”) with VeraSafe within twenty business days of Participant’s receipt of the Complaint from VeraSafe. The Participant’s Response must either:
defend the Participant’s actions as permitted under the applicable Framework(s);
dispute the validity of information presented in the Complaint and contain all available documentation to support the dispute; or
admit fault and agree to remedy the alleged violation(s) as determined by VeraSafe in its sole discretion.
6.2.
Upon VeraSafe’s receipt of the Participant’s Response, VeraSafe will forward it to the Complainant.
6.3. Participant’s Failure to Respond.
If the Participant fails to file a timely Response, the failure to comply with the Procedure will be duly noted in the next Annual Procedure Report (as such term is defined in Section 15 of the Procedure) and VeraSafe shall refer the matter to the appropriate government agency in accordance with Section 14 of the Procedure.
7. Consultative Mediation
7.1. Mediation Teleconference.
If the Complainant is not satisfied by the Participant’s Response to the Complaint, and desires to continue with the Procedure, the Complainant must file with VeraSafe a request for a mediation session to be conducted via telephone (hereinafter, a “Mediation Teleconference”) within ten business days of receiving the Participant’s Response. The Mediation Teleconference is an informal process for the Parties to reexamine the details of the Complaint and work towards a mutually agreeable resolution with the assistance of an approved mediator under the requirements set forth herein.
If the Complainant is satisfied by the Participant’s Response to the Complaint, the Complainant shall notify VeraSafe in writing that the Complaint has been resolved.
If VeraSafe receives notification from the Complainant that the Complainant is satisfied with the Participant’s Response, or otherwise receives no request for a Mediation Teleconference from the Complainant within the timeframe specified in Section 7.1, VeraSafe shall close the Complaint with an outcome of “Closed by Default” and duly notify the Parties.
7.2. Mediation Teleconference Procedure.
VeraSafe will provide and appoint a mediator to lead the Mediation Teleconference with a requisite knowledge of data privacy concepts and the issues involved in the Parties’ dispute to lead the Mediation Teleconference (the “Mediator”). VeraSafe will make a reasonable effort to schedule the teleconference with due regard for the schedules of the Parties and will notify the Parties of the scheduled time and date not less than fifteen business days before the date of the Mediation Teleconference.
Possible Outcomes of the Mediation Teleconference.
Complainant’s Failure to Comply.
If the Complainant fails to appear at the scheduled time of the Mediation Teleconference, it will be assumed that the Participant’s Response has satisfied the Complainant and the Complaint will be closed with an outcome of “Closed by Default” and the Parties duly notified.
Participant’s Failure to Comply.
If the Participant fails to appear at the scheduled time of the Mediation Teleconference, such failure to comply with the Procedure will be duly noted in the next Annual Procedure Report and VeraSafe shall refer the matter to the appropriate regulatory agency in accordance with Section 14.
Mutual Settlement Agreement.
If the Parties reach an agreement during the Mediation Teleconference, VeraSafe will record the terms of the Settlement Agreement (as decided by the Parties) and notify both Parties in writing of those terms within five business days of the Mediation Teleconference.
No Settlement Reached.
If no Settlement Agreement is reached during the Mediation Teleconference, the Complainant must file with VeraSafe a request for a Data Privacy Hearing within ten business days of the Mediation Teleconference or the Complaint will be closed with an outcome of “Closed by Default” and the Parties duly notified.
8. Data Privacy Hearing
8.1. Overview.
Upon the request of the Complainant made to VeraSafe in accordance with the requirements of the Procedure, an officer appointed by VeraSafe (the “Data Privacy Hearing Officer”) will review the Complaint and all Procedure Submissions in a fair and impartial way and determine if the available evidence does, by a preponderance of the evidence, substantiate the alleged violation of the Framework(s) made in the Complaint.
8.2. Exchange of Briefs.
The Complainant’s request for a Data Privacy Hearing should include a detailed brief supporting the allegation(s) in the Complaint (attaching evidence, if appropriate). Upon receipt, VeraSafe will forward the brief to the Participant.

The Data Privacy Hearing Officer shall not be the same individual who served as the Mediator
8.4. Data Privacy Hearing Administration and Procedure.
Data Privacy Hearing Officer’s Request for Information.
The Data Privacy Hearing Officer may request additional information or seek clarification from either Party regarding the Procedure Submissions.
Late Filings and Extensions.
If a Party submits required information after the specified time limits, the untimely information shall not be submitted to the Data Privacy Hearing Officer unless VeraSafe grants an extension for good cause. In lieu of such untimely Procedure Submissions, the Data Privacy Hearing Officer will proceed to use all other available Procedure Submissions in making its Hearing Decision.
Scheduling of Data Privacy Hearing.
VeraSafe will make a reasonable effort to schedule a teleconference for the Data Privacy Hearing with due regard for the schedules of the Parties and will notify the Parties of the scheduled time and date not less than fifteen business days before the date of the teleconference.
Data Privacy Hearing Procedure.
The Parties shall appear telephonically at the hearing, where they will be allowed to present their arguments and evidence (although no new arguments or evidence not contained in the Procedure Submissions will be allowed, unless good cause is shown as to why they were not included). Additionally, the Data Privacy Hearing Officer may ask questions of the Parties about their arguments and evidence.
Hearing Decision and Burden of Proof.
The Data Privacy Hearing Officer shall, based on the Procedure Submissions and Data Privacy Hearing, decide if the available evidence does, by a preponderance of the evidence, substantiate the allegation(s) made in the Complaint and, if so, whether or not the alleged action or inaction of the Participant does violate the Framework(s) (the “Hearing Decision”).
Sustained Complaints.
If, after weighing the arguments and evidence presented in the Procedure Submissions and Data Privacy Hearing, and in due consideration of the totality of the circumstances, the Data Privacy Hearing Officer determines that the available evidence does, by a preponderance of the evidence, substantiate the allegation(s) made in the Complaint, and that the action or inaction of the Participant does violate the Framework(s), the Data Privacy Hearing Officer shall require the Participant to comply with one or more Permitted Outcomes, as appropriate under the circumstances (a “Reparation Order”). The Parties will be duly notified of the Reparation Order.
No Action Taken.
If, after weighing the arguments and evidence presented in the Procedure Submissions and Data Privacy Hearing, and in due consideration of the totality of the circumstances, the Data Privacy Hearing Officer determines that the available evidence does not, by a preponderance of the evidence, substantiate the allegation(s) made in the Complaint, or that the alleged action or inaction of the Participant does not violate the applicable Framework(s), the Complaint shall be closed with an outcome of “Closed – No Action Taken” and the Parties duly notified.
9. Right to Appeal
9.1. Appeal of Data Privacy Hearing Outcome.
Within ten business days of receiving notification that the Complaint has been closed with an outcome of “Closed – No Action Taken,” the Complainant may submit an appeal to VeraSafe, if the Complainant reasonably believes that VeraSafe or the Data Privacy Hearing Officer failed to adhere to the Procedure and such failure materially affected the Hearing Decision.
9.2. Exchange of Briefs.
To be considered, the Complainant’s appeal brief must include a detailed briefing of the alleged failure to adhere to the Procedure, as well as any supporting evidence. Upon receipt of the appeal brief, VeraSafe will forward the appeal brief to the Participant. The Participant must provide a brief in rebuttal (including any supporting evidence) to VeraSafe within ten business days of receiving the Complainant’s appeal brief. The briefs are the “Appellate Procedure Submissions”.
9.3. Appellate Hearing Officer.
VeraSafe will appoint an impartial officer to administer the Appellate Hearing (the “Appellate Hearing Officer”) using the eligibility criteria described in Section 8.3. The Appellate Hearing Officer will not be the same individual who served as the Mediator or the Data Privacy Hearing Officer.
9.4. Appellate Hearing Administration and Procedure.
Consideration of Appeal.
The Appellate Hearing Officer will accept an appeal when the Appellate Procedure Submissions demonstrate that there is a reasonable likelihood that VeraSafe or the Data Privacy Hearing Officer failed to adhere to the Procedure and that such failure materially affected the Hearing Decision. If the Appellate Hearing Officer accepts the appeal, he or she will execute the Appellate Hearing Procedure. If the Appellate Hearing Officer declines to accept the appeal, he or she will provide a written explanation of the decision, which will be provided to Complainant and Participant.
The Appellate Hearing Officer may request additional information or seek clarification from either Party regarding the Appellate Procedure Submissions, either when considering the Appeal or when carrying out the Appellate Hearing Procedure.
Appellate Hearing Procedure.
The Appellate Hearing Officer will duly examine the Appellate Procedure Submissions, as well as the Procedure Submissions, and shall decide if the available evidence does, by a preponderance of the evidence, substantiate the allegation(s) made in the Complaint and, if so, whether or not the alleged action or inaction of the Participant is in violation of the applicable Framework(s) (the “Hearing Decision”).
Sustained Complaints.
If, in due examination of the Appellate Procedure Submissions and Procedure Submissions, and in due consideration of the totality of the circumstances, the Appellate Hearing Officer determines that the available evidence does, by a preponderance of the evidence, substantiate the allegation(s) made in the Complaint, and that the action or inaction of the Participant does violate the applicable Framework(s), the Appellate Hearing officer will issue a Reparation Order requiring the Participant to comply with one or more Permitted Outcomes, as appropriate under the circumstances.
