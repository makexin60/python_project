In order to protect and respect user privacy while ensuring the best user experience, we request permissions from users with the user's knowledge. Users can choose whether to agree to the authorization. Some of our applications (such as Volume Booster) require permissions as follows:
Microphone Permission: After the user turns on the microphone permission, the music spectrum can dance with the rhythm of the music. We require this permission only to optimize the user's visual experience of listening to music, and will not obtain other user information.
Draw over other apps permission: After the user opens the Draw over other apps permission, the two product functions can be used more completely - Ã¢â€˜  The edge lighting effect can still be displayed on the mobile phone after the user leaves our application, satisfying the user's personalized decoration needs for the mobile phone screen; The floating window control can still be displayed on the mobile phone screen after the user leaves our application, so as to adjust the volume, sound effect and switch songs more quickly. This permission does not obtain other user information.
Notification permission: After the user enables the notification permission, our application will appear on the notification bar. This permission helps to meet the user's needs for increasing the volume and adjusting sound effects. If the permission is not enabled, the application may be closed by the system after the user exits, resulting in the failure of volume-related functions. This permission does not obtain other user information.
