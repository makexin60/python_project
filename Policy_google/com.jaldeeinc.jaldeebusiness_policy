CLIENT TESTIMONIALS
Some of our Happy Clients
Congratulations, Team Jaldee, for developing such apt software for the current pandemic scenario! I'm impressed by the continuous support I'm receiving from the Jaldee Team. Jaldee Health Platform is helping me to convert my practice into a digital one too.
Dr Nisha
Kerala, India
Jaldee has greatly supported my hospital’s online consultation. Using Jaldee, we can cater to patients from over 21 countries. During COVID, Jaldee came to our village and implemented their system for free to help those who could not afford healthcare at that time.
Dr. Basil
Homeopathy Hospital
Their application helped us to manage our online classes systematically and professionally. In this situation of COVID-19, we were very anxious about giving proper online courses to our Degree students. Jaldee Business Suite was a complete solution for our problem.
Professor Martin
VIBGYOR Education
Jaldee Business Suite has helped me greatly in my business. I was managing my classes manually earlier. After using Jaldee, I began saving a lot of time, and I can focus solely on managing my classes. They also provide excellent support. Wishing Jaldee all the best!
