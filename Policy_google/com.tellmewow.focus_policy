We may supplement the information you provide to us with additional information gathered from other sources, such as publicly available information, or from third parties, such as marketers, partners, researchers and others. We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other product or service we provide.

Legal Bases For Use Of Your Personal Data
The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them. For example, we handle personal data on this basis for our premium users.
Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent. Where you have provided consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out prior to withdrawing your consent. To withdraw your consent, please contact us at hello@tellmewow.com
No Disclosure to Third Parties for Their Own Marketing Purposes
We believe in protecting your privacy, and therefore do not provide your personal data to third parties for their own marketing purposes.
When We Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties
We may share the categories of personal information for business purposes (as defined by applicable law) or as required by applicable law. More specifically, we may share your personal information in the following situations:
Service providers and agents
We may share your information with certain third parties selected by us to help support our operations. These include, for example, services that help us process payments, analyze web traffic, send emails, and track customer support requests.

Compliance with law and law enforcement requests, and protection of our rights.
We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief we are required to do so by law, or in response to a court order, or other legal mechanism. We may also disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure may prevent fraud and abuse of Focus - Train your Brain or its users or protect our property rights.
Consent
We may disclose your information when we believe we have your consent to do so, such as when you contact customer support and ask us about your Account, or when we have the consent of someone we believe is authorized to consent on behalf of you, such as the individual associated with the payment method for your Account. If you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal data collected by Focus - Train your Brain, we also may disclose your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented.

These service providers use technology to help us analyze how users use Focus - Train your Brain, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, how often you use our app, the events that occur within our app, where the app was downloaded from, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of Focus - Train your Brain.
