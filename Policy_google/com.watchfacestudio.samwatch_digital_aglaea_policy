Samsung Developer Privacy Policy
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Data Controller) ("
Samsung
") knows how important privacy is to its
customers and their employees and partners, and we strive to be clear about how
we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information. This Privacy Policy provides an overview of our information practices with respect to personal information collected through the Samsung Developer Portal and related events (the "
Business Services
").
This Privacy Policy may be updated
periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices with
respect to the Business Services or changes in the applicable law. We will
indicate at the top of this Privacy Policy when it was most recently updated.
If we update the Privacy Policy, we will let you know in advance about changes
we consider to be material by placing a notice on the Business Services or by
emailing you, where appropriate.
What information do we collect?
We will collect various types of personal information in connection with the Business Services.
For example:
We will collect personal information that you provide, such as your Samsung
Account ID, name, email address, country, language, job-related information,
  and topics you’re interested in;
We will collect your question details and any communications you send or deliver
  to us;
We will collect data about your use of the Business Services, including the time
and duration of your use, information stored in cookies that we have set on
your device (such as your IP address and device type), information related to
any downloads you make on the Business Services (such as apps and download
  count), and information about bookmarked pages and shared pages; and
We will collect information about your participation events, including attendance
  of events and activities within events.
You can choose not to provide us with certain types of information, such as interested topics, company name, occupation and job level. In some cases, this may limit your ability to use the Business Services. We’ll do our best to explain these limitations when we’re asking for your information so you can make an informed decision.
How do we use your information?
We may use information we collect for the following purposes:
to identify and authenticate you so you may use the Business Services;
to provide you with the Business Services;
to respond to your questions or requests made through or about the Business Services;
to offer better and more customized services that take into account your service usage record and other relevant information you provide;
subject to your separate consent where required by applicable law, to inform you about new products and services;
for assessment and analysis of our market, customers, and services (including asking you for your opinions on our products and services and carrying out customer surveys);
to understand the way companies use the Business Services so that we can improve them and develop new services;
to provide maintenance services and to maintain a sufficient level of security on the Business Services;
to link your Samsung Account to connected features or services, such as the Remote Test Lab service;
to deliver advertising on the Business Services;
to protect the rights, property, or safety of Samsung, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, employees or customers, for example, in legal proceedings, internal investigations and investigations by competent authorities; and
other purposes with your separate consent where required by applicable law or as described at the time your information is collected.
We use and combine
the information we collect about you from our Business Services, devices, or
other sources to provide you with a better experience. For example, you can use
your Samsung Account details not only on the Business Service you registered
with, but other services which use Samsung accounts. We also use the
information you provide directly or through other sources as described above to
provide content you may like or that you’ve personalized.
Samsung processes
personal information for the purposes described above. Samsung’s legal basis to
process personal information includes processing:
So that we can keep our promises to you, such as providing you with the Business Service (performance of a
contract (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)));
To promote our business interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you) (legitimate interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)));
To comply with the law, regulatory obligations and legal processes (GDPR Article 6(1)(c)); and
With your consent (GDPR Article 6(1)(a)).
To whom do we disclose your information?
We will disclose your information internally within our business and the following entities, but only for the above purposes.
Affiliates: Other Samsung Electronics Group companies which we control or own.
Service Providers: Carefully selected companies that provide services for or on behalf of us. These providers are also committed to protecting your information.
Other parties when required
by law or as necessary to protect our business: For example, it may be
necessary by law, legal process, or court order from governmental authorities
to disclose your information. They may also seek your information from us for
the purposes of law enforcement, national security, anti-terrorism, or other issues that are related to public security.
Other parties in connection with corporate transactions: We may disclose your information to a third party as part of a merger or transfer, acquisition or sale, or in the event of a bankruptcy.
Other parties with your consent or at your direction: In addition to the disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties when you separately consent to or request such sharing.
Submissions
that you make to public areas of a website, mobile application, or other online
service, such as bulletin boards may be viewable to other users of the Business
Services. We do not control, and are not responsible for, how other users of
the Business Services may use this information. For example, personal
information that you submit in public areas could be collected and used by
others to send you unsolicited messages or for other purposes.
How do we keep your information secure?
We take data
protection seriously. We’ve put in place physical and technical safeguards to
keep the information we collect secure. However, please note that although we
take reasonable steps to protect your information, no website, Internet
transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure.
Where do we send your data?
Your use or
participation in the Business Services may involve transfer, storage and
processing of your information outside of your country of residence, consistent
with this policy. Such countries include, without limitation, the Republic of
Korea, the United States of America, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Poland. Please note that the data protection and other laws
of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as
comprehensive as those in your country. We will take appropriate measures, in
compliance with applicable law, to ensure that your personal information
remains protected. Such measures include the use of Standard Contractual
Clauses to safeguard the transfer of data outside of the EEA or UK. For more
information on the safeguards we take to ensure the lawful transfer of your
data to countries outside of the EU or UK, or to obtain a copy of the
contractual agreements in place, please contact us by the methods outlined in
the
Contact Us
section of this Privacy Policy.
What are your rights?
Your personal
information belongs to you. You can ask us to provide details about what we’ve
collected, and you can ask us to delete it or correct any inaccuracies. You can
also ask us to restrict or limit processing, sharing, or transfer of your
personal information, as well as to provide to you your personal information
that we’ve collected so you can use it for your own purposes. To exercise your
rights, please contact us by the methods outlined in the
Contact Us
section of
this Privacy Policy.
However, requesting
the deletion of your personal information may also result in a loss of access
to the Business Services.
If
you request deletion of personal information, you acknowledge that you may not
be able to access or use the Business Services and that residual personal
information may continue to reside in Samsung's records and archives for some
time in compliance with applicable law, but Samsung will not use that
information for commercial purposes. You understand that, despite your request
for deletion, Samsung reserves the right to keep your personal information, or
a relevant part of it, in line with our data retention policy and applicable
laws, if Samsung has suspended, limited, or terminated your access to the
website for violating the Samsung Terms of Use or any other applicable Samsung
policy or applicable law, when necessary to protect
the rights, property, or safety of Samsung, or any of our respective
affiliates, business partners, employees or customers
How long do we keep your information?
We won’t keep your
personal information for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it
was collected. This means that information will be destroyed or erased from our
systems when it’s no longer required.
We take appropriate steps
to ensure that we process and retain information about you based on the
following logic:
At least the duration for which the information is used to provide you with a service;
As required under law, regulatory obligation, a contract, or with regard to our statutory obligations;
Only for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, is processed, or longer if required under any contract, by applicable law, or for statistical purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards.
