Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you use the Garmin Explore™ website, create an account, activate and use your inReach® device, utilize inReach® satellite subscription services, and/or use a compatible app, such as the Earthmate™,  Garmin Explore™, Garmin Messenger™ or Alpha Hunt apps.
What personal data does Garmin collect?
While exploring the outdoors with Garmin, you might save your favorite routes and waypoints, send messages or your location to friends and family, or — in the case of an unforeseen issue — communicate with Garmin Response℠ and emergency service personnel. We ask for personal data — such as your name, email address, location, and other information — so you can sign in to your account, receive personalized support, receive important safety information about your devices and services, and get the most out of our products.

When You Get an inReach Subscription
inReach® service plans provide off-grid communication, interactive SOS, tracking and more via the Iridium® satellite network. Due to the comprehensive nature of inReach® service plans, additional information is required to be collected. For example, we process your phone number and email address so we can communicate with you as necessary and relay your billing information.
When You Use inReach Services
Our inReach® products and satellite communication services enable you to send an interactive SOS alert in an emergency. To appropriately respond to an SOS activation, we may need to use the location of your inReach® device, emergency information from your account, and text, SMS, and email messages sent to and from your inReach® device.
When You Sync Devices
When you sync devices, data such as your IP address, sync time and date, and battery level will be uploaded to Garmin.
When You Upload Activities From the Garmin Explore App
If you choose to upload recorded activities or tracked routes from the Garmin Explore™ or Earthmate® app to your Garmin account, we collect data from those activities so you can view and analyze it. You can even share it with others — but you don’t have to. You can withdraw your consent and delete activities or tracked routes at any time.

Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you use the Garmin Connect website, mobile app, and compatible Garmin devices.
What Personal Data Does Garmin collect?
Garmin Connect was created to help you track your fitness and wellness and pursue your personal goals. We ask you for personal data — such as height, weight, and sleep times — to help you reach those goals and provide you with personalized insights and stats.
Learn more
When You Make a Garmin Account
Garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in. It also helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
When You Add a Device
When you add a Garmin device to your Garmin Connect account, we ask for information such as your height, weight, gender, and birthdate so we can personalize your stats and goals. We store information such as your sleep and wake times so we don't send you "get moving" notifications while you're sleeping. We also store your recorded activities and heart rate, so you can tell when you beat that PR or lower your fitness age.
When You Sync Devices
When you sync your device, we collect data such as your IP address, sync time and date, and battery level to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues and to provide better customer support. We also collect usage and trend data to help us improve our features and apps.
When You Use Location Features
Services such as GPS tracking during a run or weather updates on your device require that Garmin collect your location at that time. Your GPS data during activities does get uploaded to Garmin Connect, but you have control over who sees it from there.
When You Contact Garmin
We know you might want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact, device, or subscription information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.

DO YOU HAVE TO UPLOAD YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO GARMIN?
You can still use your device without uploading data to Garmin. However, most of the features of the Garmin Connect app or website will be limited or unavailable.
View Full Privacy Policy
Why does Garmin ask for your personal data?
From providing product support to offering motivation to reach your goals, the information we ask for is used to improve your Garmin Connect experiences.

To Give You Personalised Stats and Insights
We use personal data, such as height, weight, gender and age, to provide you more accurate stats, such as how many calories you burn during an activity, and insights, such as how you compare to similar users.
To Help You Track Your Activities, Competitions and Goals
If you choose to upload data from your Garmin device to Garmin Connect, we collect recorded data from those activities so you can analyse it and track your progress toward your goals. If you want to, you can even share your activity data with others. Plus, you can withdraw your consent and delete activities at any time.
If you’re opted-in to product improvement, we internally process activity data to help us improve on our products and services. Again, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
To Keep You Informed
When we have something important to tell you about your products, apps, subscriptions, or account — such as vital safety information, app updates, new products or deals, and updates to our privacy policy — we use collected contact information to reach you.

Activity Data
Your activity data is set to private by default. If you want others to see your daily runs and cheer you on, you can adjust your privacy settings to allow that. You can also like or comment on other activities in your news feed, and those likes and comments will be visible to others.
Competitions and Challenges
When you join a Leaderboard or Challenge, other participants will be able to see your activity data and any comments you submit to the Leaderboard or Challenge. This includes anyone who is part of your Garmin Jr. family account — even if they aren’t part of that Challenge and your account is set to private.
When you participate in Garmin Sports competitions, the people you’re competing with will be able to see activity data for that competition.
Connections
When you join groups or make connections, depending on your privacy settings, some or all of your profile and activity data may be visible to those groups or connections.
Third-party Apps
We will not share your activity data with third parties unless you tell us to. For example, you can instruct Garmin Connect to share your activity data with a third-party wellness program provider or apps such as MyFitnessPal and Strava.
LIVETRACK
You can share a link to your device’s real-time location with your friends and family so they can follow along as you run.

Garmin Jr.
Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store you and your child’s personal data when you use the Garmin Jr. application ("Garmin Jr. app").
What personal data does Garmin collect?
The Garmin Jr. app was created to help your child track their activities, chores, and even gain rewards — all while exploring new adventures. We ask for personal data — such as your name, email address, family name, your children's names, location, and other information — so you can sign in to your account, receive personalized support, monitor your children's activities, receive important safety information about your devices, and get the most out of our products and apps.
Learn more
When You Make a Garmin Account
Garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in. It also helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
When You Create a Garmin Jr. App Family Profile
We use your Garmin Connect name as your admin name for your profile. We also ask for your family name and names for the children you add to your profile. However, you don’t have to use any real names. If you want to be the Smiths, that works for us. If you want your children’s names to be Thing 1 and Thing 2, no problem. We also ask you to provide display text for each of your children's devices, which can be any text you wish. You can add photos of your children, their birthdays, and their genders to your family profile, but you don’t have to.
We set default sleep and wake times so you can monitor your children's sleep. You have the option to change it if you want, but you don’t have to. It’s the same with your location and your children's birthdays and genders. It’s all optional, based on how you want to use the app.
When Your Child Uses the Toe-to-Toe Challenge Feature
When your child engages in a Toe-to-Toe step challenge, the display text you chose for your child’s device will be displayed on the device of the child they’re competing with and in the app of that child's parent or guardian.
When You Challenge Other Families
We use your admin name and family name to help you find Connections and other families you want to compete with. During a challenge, your name, the names you use for your children in your profile, and the total steps for you and each family member will be displayed in the app of the other family’s admin.
When You Invite a Second Parent or Guardian
You may choose to invite another parent or guardian to help monitor your children's activities, chores, and rewards. We’ll ask for that guardian’s name and email so they can be invited to join your family.
When You Use Location Features
If your child’s device is configured to use location-based features such as live tracking and geofencing, your child’s location data is transmitted to the Garmin Jr. app, but you have control over who sees it from there.
When You Sync Devices
When you sync your child’s device with the Garmin Jr. app, your child’s activities, chores, rewards, and sleep times will be uploaded to Garmin, and you can monitor their progress. If you don’t want to do that, just refrain from syncing with the app.
We also collect data such as your IP address, sync time and date and battery level to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues and to provide better customer support.
When You Contact Garmin
We know you might want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact, device, or subscription information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.

Steps and Activities
Your children's activity data is automatically set to private when you upload it to Garmin. When your child engages in a Toe-to-Toe step challenge, their display text and total steps during the challenge will be displayed on the other child’s device and in the app of that child's parent or guardian. Your name and steps and those of the family members in your profile will be shown to other families when you engage in challenges with them.
Garmin Jr. App Community
Other Garmin Jr. app users will be able to see your family name, admin name, the names of any added parents or guardians, and the number of children on your profile. Your Connections will be able to see the same information plus the names you provided for the children in your profile.

When You Participate in the ActiveCaptain Community
Interacting with the ActiveCaptain Community, through the website or app, gets you the best fishing and boating information from people like you. When you add reviews and comments or earn points, we use data such as your captain name or email address to make sure you get the credit you deserve and the points you’ve earned.
When You Participate in the Quickdraw Community
We can all agree that location plays a big role in the survey data you use and upload to Quickdraw Contours within the Quickdraw Community. We collect that data, but we add it anonymously to the Quickdraw Contours database. Your personal information is not associated with it at that point — just the location.
When You Use the OnDeck Service
We may collect the names, email addresses, or phone numbers for the people you want to have access to the service. That way, they’ll get notifications when you set up or make changes to the account. If you don’t add them as a contact or owner, we won’t collect anything. We just want to make sure you and the people you add get the most out of the service.
When You Sync to Your Garmin Account
When you sync your device, we process your saved waypoints and routes. That way, your data will stay the same across all your devices.
When You Purchase a Subscription
Subscriptions require a little more information to make sure we can deliver the services you’re purchasing. So, when you get an OnDeck or ActiveCaptain Business Program subscription, we collect your name, business name, email address, billing address, and telephone number, which are used to deliver the services you’re paying for and to send you the billing information you need.
We have a third party process your payment information, but Garmin does not store your payment card details.
When You Buy, Register, or Update Charts and Devices
We use your credentials and device information to get downloaded maps or map cards onto your devices, to register new devices to your Garmin account, and to provide quality customer service.
We have a third party process your payment information, but Garmin does not store your payment card details.
When You Add or Are an Emergency Contact
If you set up emergency contacts on your Garmin device, your location and other emergency information will be sent or communicated to that contact in the event of an incident.
If a Garmin user adds you as an emergency contact to their Garmin account, they provide us your phone number or email address so you can be reached in the event of an incident.

When You Use the Position Reporting Feature
When you use Garmin avionics products with the position reporting feature, we process your aircraft’s tail number, latitude, longitude, estimated time en route, and associated flight details. If you use a Garmin avionics wearable, this data is uploaded to your Garmin Connect account. We use this information to help you keep track of important flight details and so you can share your aircraft’s position with others during your flights.
When You Use the Pilot Logbook Feature
When you use the pilot logbook feature on the flyGarmin website or desktop app or in the Garmin Pilot app, we process information about your flights, such as the takeoff and landing airports, dates and times, and other notes, so you have a tool to maintain your required records in your pilot logs.
When You Buy Products or Subscriptions
When you buy products, like aviation databases, or subscriptions from a Garmin website or through the Garmin Pilot app, we ask for information such as your name, address, and phone number so we can process and fulfill your order. We have a third party process your payment information, but Garmin does not store your payment card details.
When You Use Connext Satellite Services
When you use Connext phone and text messaging, we process the to-and-from phone numbers and time and date for incoming and outgoing calls and text messages, as well as phone call duration and payment information for billing purposes.

When you add reviews and comments or earn points, we use data such as your captain name or email address to make sure you get the credit you deserve and the points you’ve earned.

We can all agree that location plays a big role in the survey data you use and upload to Quickdraw Contours within the Quickdraw Community. We collect that data, but we add it anonymously to the Quickdraw Contours database. Your personal information is not associated with it at that point — just the location.
When You Use the OnDeck Service
We may collect the names, email addresses, or phone numbers for the people you want to have access to the service. That way, they’ll get notifications when you set up or make changes to the account. If you don’t add them as a contact or owner, we won’t collect anything. We just want to make sure you and the people you add get the most out of the service.
When You Sync to Your Garmin Account
When you sync your device, we process your saved waypoints and routes. That way, your data will stay the same across all your devices.
When You Purchase a Subscription
Subscriptions require a little more information to make sure we can deliver the services you’re purchasing. So, when you get an OnDeck or ActiveCaptain Business Program subscription, we collect your name, business name, email address, billing address, and telephone number, which are used to deliver the services you’re paying for and to send you the billing information you need.
We have a third party process your payment information, but Garmin does not store your payment card details.

We use your credentials and device information to get downloaded maps or map cards onto your devices, to register new devices to your Garmin account, and to provide quality customer service.

Garmin Dive App
Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you use the Garmin Dive mobile app and compatible Garmin devices.
What personal data does Garmin collect?
The Garmin Dive app was created to help you track your dives and improve your diving experiences. We ask you for dive data — such as dive type, water type and temperature, depth, heart rate, pulse oximetry, ascent and descent time, and more — to help you get the most out of your dives and provide you with personalized insights and stats.
Learn more
Account Information
We collect a name and email address when you create a Garmin account. The name you associate with your account doesn’t even have to be your full name. It could just be your first name or a nickname. We use it to personalize your experience and help you interact with the dive community. We collect your email address so you can actually sign in to your account and get all the helpful dive data you’ve built up.
Device Information
When you add a Garmin device to your Garmin account, we ask for your preferred display settings and dive preferences — such as your favourite dive spots — so you can have the experience you want.
When You Sync Devices
When you sync your device, we collect data such as your IP address, sync time and date, and battery level to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues and to provide better customer support. We also collect usage and trend data to help us improve our features and apps.
Contact Information
We know you want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your name, email address, and phone number during support calls to ensure you get the help you need.
Location-based Services
GPS services you use on your device during a dive — such as entry and exit points and surface interval — require that Garmin collect your location at that time. When you sync dive activities containing GPS data to the app, you have control over who sees them.
View Full Privacy Policy
Do You Have to Upload Dive Activity Information to Garmin?
Nope. You can use your device for all your dives without uploading dive data from your device to the app. However, you won’t be able to use some Garmin Dive features such as interacting with the dive community or getting dive insights and trends.
View Full Privacy Policy
Why does Garmin ask for your personal data?
From providing product support to analyzing your dive performance, the information we ask for is used to improve your Garmin Dive experience.
Learn more
To Help You Track and Analyse Your Dives
If you choose to upload dive data from your Garmin device to the Garmin Dive app, we collect recorded data from those activities so you can log your dives and get dive analysis information. If you want to, you can even share your data with other divers in the dive community. Plus, you can withdraw your consent and delete activities at any time.
If you’re opted-in to product improvement, we internally process dive data to help us improve our products and services. Again, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
To Keep You Informed
When we have something important to tell you about your products, apps, subscriptions, or account — such as vital safety information, app updates, new products or deals, and updates to our privacy policy — we use collected contact information to reach you.
To Improve Our Sites and Apps
When you visit our sites or use our apps, we collect information — such as your IP address, location, times that you visit, and more — to let us know how people navigate our sites and apps and how we can improve them.
View Full Privacy Policy
Does Garmin sell your personal data?
No! We don’t sell your data to anyone. And we only share it with others in specific situations.
Learn more
Data Shared Within Garmin
Garmin is global, which means your personal data may be stored locally or in another country or transferred between Garmin companies. No matter where your information is within Garmin, it is still secured under this privacy policy.
Data Shared with Service Providers
We share personal data with third parties who provide services — such as analytics and hosting services and sending emails to customers — for us.
With Others
Garmin will share your personal data when you ask us to or when required to by law enforcement and in other legal matters.
View Full Privacy Policy
How can you share your personal data?
Your dive activity data belongs to you, and you control what you share and with whom you share it.
Learn more
Dive Activity Data
Any time you upload a dive, you get to determine how private or public it is. If you want others in the Garmin Dive community to see a dive and cheer you on, just set that dive to public when you upload it.
Dive Community
You can choose to share your dive data, including pictures you take, with members of the dive community. If you ever change your mind, you can make that information or those photos private at any time.

Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:
When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish. We may also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We process your email address and password because you use your email address and password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address and password for this purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you enable two-factor authentication, we process your mobile phone number or email address to send the security code via SMS or email. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you reside in mainland China, we process your mobile phone number for purposes of real name authentication.
(b) We also process your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on our websites or apps or engage with other users. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is our legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other users.
(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receive direct marketing information from us, we will also process your email address or other account identifiers for the purpose of sending you marketing communications (e.g., emails, push notifications) about our products, services, and apps, as well as newsletters. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your
preferences
in your account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from us are based on the preferences you provide in your account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your  account, and any subscriptions included in your account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is our legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails. If you reside in mainland China, we may use your mobile phone number to send you marketing communications via SMS.
(d) We also process your email address to associate it with your account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.
(e) We also process your email address to notify customers when they have violated our terms. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in ensuring a quality experience for all customers and ensuring adherence to our terms.

If you choose this method, the first time you sign in, you will be asked whether you agree to the social media provider delivering certain information to us, such as your identifier, nickname, email address, profile photo, and other information associated with your social media account.
All of this information is made available to us by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-on configuration works. However, the only information we retain and process is your email address. If you do not want your information to be shared with us by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your account using your account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
We associate the email address provided by the social media provider with your account so you can use your email address to sign in to your account in the future if you no longer wish to sign in using your social media account credentials. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is our legitimate interest in providing you an alternative sign-in method and in securing your account.
Personal data that is processed if you choose to provide it:
You can add additional information to your profile or upload photos or other content when you use our apps. The categories of personal data depend on the app but may include details concerning activities you participate in (e.g., equipment), photos, gender, birthdate, height, and weight.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
This information is used to personalize your profile or to enable you to post content to the app (e.g., photos of your activities). In some apps, we may use this information to facilitate your use of the app, such as to calculate the calories you burn during an activity or to calculate your performance during indoor cycling activities. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is your consent. You can withdraw your consent by deleting this information from your account profile.
Personal data that is processed when you choose to upload or add your data to your Garmin account:
You can choose to upload from your device or, in some cases, manually add activities (e.g., runs, walks, bike rides, indoor cycling, swims, hikes, gym activities, golf rounds, dives, etc.) and activity, health, and wellness data (e.g., steps, distance, pace, activity time, calories burned, heart rate, sleep, location, golf stats, menstrual cycle information, hydration, music played, etc.) to your account. You can use your device without providing your consent to upload your activities to your account. If you choose to add your activities to your account, you control whether others can see your activity data by managing the privacy settings in your account. Your activity data is set to "Private" by default.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We process this data, if you choose to upload or add it to your account, to enable you to analyze this data, identify any devices used to collect data during the activity, see your location on your activity course and segment maps, see your heart rate related metrics such as stress score, Body Battery energy monitoring, or pulse oximetry, track your fitness goals, and, if you wish, share this data with others. If you reside in the EEA, U.K., or Switzerland, the legal ground for this processing is your explicit consent, which you can withdraw at any time within your account.
(b) For apps that have an Insights feature, if you choose to upload or add this data to your account and you choose to participate in Insights, then you will be presented with an Insights section in your account in which you  can view a comparison of your uploaded data with aggregated activity data of others in the Garmin Connect community. If you reside in the EEA, U.K., or Switzerland, the legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is your explicit consent, which you can withdraw at any time within your account.
(c) We also process this data, if you choose to upload or add it to your account, in an aggregated manner to analyze usage and trends and develop or improve features and services. Our use of this data, once aggregated, may include publishing statistics and trends of interest to you or other members of our user communities. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing relevant and quality features and services.
(d) If you choose to upload or add this data to your account and you are opted in to product improvement, we will process this data for research and development purposes internally to help us build better and more relevant products and services. If you reside in the EEA, U.K., or Switzerland, the legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is your explicit consent, which you can withdraw at any time within your account.
Personal data that is processed when you add a Garmin device to your Garmin account:
When you add certain devices to your account, we collect device information such as device identifiers and settings. We also ask you to provide additional information, such as your gender, height, weight, birthdate, activity level (low, medium, or high), and normal bed and wake times.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process your device information to associate your device to your account. Settings information is processed to update your device with your preferred settings. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is our legitimate interest in allowing you to easily customize your settings and keep them synced. We also process the additional information you provide to calculate the calories you burn during an activity, provide you insights about your activities and sleep (if you give your explicit consent to be presented with insights), to set your wearable device to "do not disturb" mode during your normal sleep hours, and to provide other features specific to the app or device you use. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time by removing your device from your account and deleting this information from your profile.
Personal data that is processed when you enable email notifications:
If you enable email notifications, we process your email address in accordance with your notification settings.

The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You can withdraw this consent at any time by changing your email settings to opt out of receiving such notifications or by disabling email notifications
Personal data that is processed when you sync your Garmin device:
When you sync your device directly or through a compatible Garmin app, we log data about the transmission, such as the IP address used when syncing, the sync time and date, crash/diagnostic logs, geographic location of the device, information about your device, information about the network used to sync (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular), and device battery level.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process this information to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is our legitimate interest in resolving errors or syncing issues and providing quality product support. We also process this information to analyze usage and trends and develop or improve features and services. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing relevant and quality features and services.
Personal data that is processed when you connect your Garmin account to a third-party app if you choose:
If you choose to enable your account to access accounts you have with other app providers, such as your MyFitnessPal, Strava, or TrainingPeaks account, we will obtain information about you from such account, such as the number of calories consumed in a particular day based on information from your MyFitnessPal account or courses and segments from your Strava account.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
This information is used to supplement your activity information in Garmin Connect™ with information you have provided to such third-party apps. The legal ground for this processing is your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disconnecting your account from the third-party app within your account.
Personal data that is processed when you communicate with Garmin:
When you interact with our customer support representatives by email or telephone, online, or in person, we collect personal data, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences, and information about the products you own, such as their serial numbers and dates of purchase, and subscriptions you've purchased. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues and capture information relating to the support or service issue. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys. With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process this information to provide you with customer and product support, to monitor the quality and types of customer and product support we provide to our customers, and to facilitate repairs, returns, or exchanges. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is our legitimate interest in providing quality product support. The legal ground for signing in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue is your consent, which you may withdraw.
Personal data that is processed when you use our live location-based services:
If you choose to use location-based services, such as weather, on your device or app, then the physical location of your device or connected mobile device will be collected in order for us or our providers to provide you with such location-based services.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
The purpose of processing the location of your device is to provide you the location-based services you wish to use. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is legitimate interest.
Personal data that is processed when you are a real-time tracking (e.g., LiveTrack) invitee or emergency contact on someone's Garmin account:
If a Garmin user sends you an invitation to track their location or activity in real time (e.g., via the LiveTrack feature) or adds you as an emergency contact to their Garmin account, they provide us your phone number or email address.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
We use this information to send you the real-time tracking information or to notify you of an incident involving the Garmin user. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is our legitimate interest in enabling our users to send real-time tracking information to their friends and family, and in enabling our users to notify their emergency contacts if they are involved in an incident and need assistance.
Personal data that is processed when you use the Assistance Plus service:
When you use the Assistance Plus service, we process your email address, mailing address, telephone number, and contact information for your chosen emergency contacts.

PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We process text messages sent to and from your device and the location of your device when your device communicates with Garmin Response℠ in order for Garmin and its service providers to perform the Assistance Plus service. The legal ground for this processing is performance of a contract.
(b) We process your mailing address and telephone number to determine if Garmin Response℠ has been activated inadvertently by a subscriber at their residence. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in minimizing the number of false alarms.
Personal data that is processed to address fraud and abuse:
We take steps to identify, detect, and mitigate fraud and abuse on our services, websites, and apps. If we suspect a fraudulent request or claim has been made relating to your account or device, we may process data relating to the device(s) associated with your account, basic account information such as email address, name, phone number(s), and mailing address(es), or our communication history with you in order to adequately investigate the request or claim. We may process content that you have contributed to your account, such as activities, photos, comments, and reviews, to develop and test measures to help identify, detect, and mitigate disruption and damage to our services, websites, and apps potentially caused by or related to such content, to enforce our terms of use, to identify and remove inappropriate, harmful, or abusive content, and for related purposes.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
We perform these processing activities to protect the interests of Garmin, its customers, and other stakeholders against fraud, breach of contract, and other harmful or unlawful actions.  The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in reducing fraud and abuse perpetuated through the use of, or in connection with, our products and services.
Personal data that is processed when you purchase a product, service, or subscription:
When you purchase a product, service, or subscription, we collect your name, email address, mailing address, billing address, and telephone number. We do not view or store your payment card information, which is handled by third-party service providers. When you purchase a subscription through your app store provider (e.g., Apple, Google), they will collect certain personal data, such as your name, email address, and payment information. Garmin will receive personal data such as your name and email address, but we do not view or store your payment card information, which is handled by the applicable app store provider.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We collect your name, mailing address, and telephone number so we can process your order and fulfill your purchase. The legal ground for processing your name, mailing address, and telephone number for these purposes is performance of a contract.

.
Personal data that is processed to display personalized content in a Garmin app:
We will occasionally display information (e.g., offers) in our apps about Garmin products and services that are compatible with the app you are using. To limit this information to only that which is likely relevant to you, we may process personal data such as your gender, existing Garmin devices that you have paired to the app, and information from your activity (e.g., average daily step counts). Personal data is not shared with third parties for this purpose.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
We process this personal data to help display relevant information to users of our apps. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is our legitimate interest in reducing the amount of information displayed to each particular user by selecting which users will see certain information based on relevance rather than displaying the same information to every user.
Categories of Recipients of Personal Data
OTHER  GARMIN USERS OR THE PUBLIC:
Your activities and activity data associated with your Garmin account are set to "Private" by default. You may decide to make your activity data public or allow others to view your activities and activity data by changing the privacy settings in your Garmin account. When you choose to interact with other users in the app, you will be displaying your data relating to that interaction (e.g., aggregate number of steps during the duration of a steps leaderboard or challenge) even if your privacy settings in your Garmin account are set to "Private."
FAMILY MEMBERS OF GARMIN JR. CHALLENGE PARTICIPANTS:
When you choose to participate in challenges that include participants who are part of a Garmin Jr. family account, challenge participants and anyone in their family account may view your data relating to the challenge and its leaderboard, even if they are not participating in the challenge and even if your privacy settings in your Garmin account are set to "Private."
YOUR REAL-TIME TRACKING INVITEES:
Some Garmin devices include features, such as LiveTrack, that enable you to send a link to people of your choice that allows them to see the real-time location of your device. Because anyone with access to the link will be able to see the real-time location of your Garmin device, you should use caution in determining to whom you want to send the link and be sure that you trust them to not send the link to others whom you do not want to be able to view the location of your Garmin device.
EMERGENCY CONTACTS, SEARCH AND RESCUE AUTHORITIES, AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS:
If you setup and use certain services such as Assistance Plus, Garmin may provide information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, the message content, time sent, and the identity and location of the message sender and recipient, to your emergency contacts or competent search and rescue authorities and emergency responders.
THIRD-PARTY APP, PLATFORM, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH WHOM YOU ASK GARMIN TO SHARE YOUR DATA:
If you choose to authorize us to permit a third party, such as your wellness program provider, or an app, such as MyFitnessPal, Strava, or TrainingPeaks, to access your activity data in your Garmin account, then we will share such data with the third party. We will not do this without your explicit consent. Once you direct us to share data with a third party, the third party's handling of your personal data is the responsibility of that third party, and you should carefully review the third party's privacy policy. You can choose to stop sharing data with the third-party app, platform, or service provider at any time within your Garmin account.
