These Services help the Service to provide services (for example, they can assist the Service in providing customised advertising or they can assist the Service with the prevention, detection, mitigation, and investigation of potentially illegal acts). These service providers will only have access to the information necessary to perform the relevant functions. These third parties are obligated not to disclose or use User’s information for other purposes.
