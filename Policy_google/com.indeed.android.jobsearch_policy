Indeed does this for a reason: we want you to have as much knowledge about what we do for you at Indeed as is possible. We do not want you to wonder about any of our processes or procedures or guess as to what your interaction with Indeed means. We want you to understand it, which is why we must explain it in detail. We urge you to read these terms or any section of interest to you. You are agreeing to proceed under them.

A. Terms of Service for Job Seekers
For purposes of this Section A of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as a Job Seeker. As a Job Seeker, you are permitted to use Indeed’s Site and its content solely for non-commercial purposes. You further agree that the
Terms of Service for All Users
also apply. For the avoidance of doubt where the Terms of Service for All Users overlap or conflict with the Terms of Service for Job Seekers, you agree that the Terms of Service for Job Seekers will govern.
1. Job Ads or Job Listings
Indeed may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through the Site’s search results or otherwise through the Site. Searching for Job Ads on the Site is free for Job Seekers. The Site displays Job Ads based on a combination of compensation paid by employers to Indeed and relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted on the Site. While Indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Indeed job search free for Job Seekers, all Job Ads are considered advertising.
Job Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that Indeed has no control over the content of Job Ads, links to or from Job Ads, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site. For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Indeed endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site. If you leave the Indeed Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party. Except for sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner. Indeed has no obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job Ads, in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Ads from the Site or your search result without any obligation to provide reasoning for removal or exclusion. You understand and agree that Indeed has no obligation to present you with any or all Job Ads. We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Ad or other information submitted by any Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user. Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Ads, or other information submitted by any Employer or other user.
When you initiate a job application on a website operated by an Employer or its applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as via Application Programming Interfaces (API), cookies, pixels and web beacons. The information collected includes, for example, information about job listings you viewed and job applications you started and completed. An Employer who uses tracker functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law. Indeed has no control over such an Employer or its website. Indeed’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such tracker functionality will be according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed may provide independent functionality to assist you. For example, Indeed may provide search options to help you narrow down Job Ads search results by job type categories (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the Job Ads. In some cases, Indeed may automatically apply search options to your Job Ad search results, which may be based on information from your Profile or your activity on the Site, but you can turn off any automatically applied search option at any time. Indeed may reformat Job Listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile phone. Indeed may also promote Job Ads by select Employers on certain pages or websites dedicated to a specific topic, such as inclusive hiring, or military-friendly job posts. The placement of a Job Ad on a dedicated page or website is not a representation regarding the nature of the role for legal purposes (for example gig economy postings are not necessarily limited to contractor status jobs and may also include engagements for employment relationships) or a representation regarding the attributes of an Employer. Indeed does not guarantee that applying to jobs through a dedicated page or website will lead to a better job application experience, a job interview, or a job offer. The dedicated pages or website do not contain an exhaustive list of Job Ads, and no  inferences can be drawn with respect to Job Ads or Employers that are not displayed on dedicated pages. Indeed may also provide functionality to call a telephone number contained in a Job Ad using the phone app on a mobile device. Indeed cannot guarantee that the extracted phone number is the correct phone number for the Employer or for the Job Ad you are viewing.
2. Resume and Profile
By creating or adding information to a profile through the Site or uploading a file resume on the Site (collectively, “Your Profile” or “Job Seeker Profile” or “Indeed Profile”), you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available Your Indeed Profile to anyone accessing our Site, such as Employers that Indeed believes may have an interest in Your Profile, users of Indeed’s Resume Search Program or Smart Sourcing, or anyone with access to the URL associated with your searchable Profile. We offer you the option to make Your Profile searchable on the Site to help you find a job. You are responsible for keeping Your Profile accurate and up-to-date. Any information that you submit through the Site, including information in Your Profile, is subject to this Agreement (including Sections D.3 and D.4.) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
When you create or add information to Your Profile on the Site, Your Profile is set to searchable on the Site (“Searchable”) by default. If you do not want Indeed to make Your Profile available to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Indeed Profile and uploaded file resume to not searchable or “cannot be found” through the Site (“Not Searchable”). This can be done by going to your “Profile” page and changing the settings to “not searchable” or “employers can’t find you on Indeed.” Profiles that are not searchable on the Site are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker has submitted an application or provided their resume. Applying to jobs or otherwise sharing Your Profile with Employers may result in Your Profile being copied and published even if it is set to Not Searchable. While you may change Your Profile privacy settings at any time, setting Your Profile to Not Searchable will not affect your previous applications or prevent employers you responded to from contacting you. Profiles set to Searchable, including yours, can be copied by search engines and other third parties accessing the Site, who can then make those Profiles publicly available elsewhere. Indeed does not control such third parties. If Your Profile is copied in this manner, then setting it to Not Searchable on the Site will not affect those third parties or the copies they have made of Your Profile. Changes to Your Profile on the Site may or may not be reflected on copies made by third parties. Even if your Profile is set to Searchable, we may hide your Profile from your current or prior employers, but cannot guarantee that you will not be found by these employers. If you do not want Your Profile to ever be publicly visible or copyable, you must keep it set to Not Searchable. Indeed may set any Searchable Profile to Non-Searchable, or otherwise make it unavailable, if it contains content prohibited by this Agreement or for any other reason in Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Your Profile, your information, or application information that you share with Employers or otherwise make public. You can read more about privacy on Indeed
here
.
Do not include sensitive or confidential information, such as a background check, credit report, medical or health information, social security number or other identification numbers, in your Indeed Profile that you do not wish to be viewable by employers or others. If Indeed discovers or determines that data contained in your Indeed Profile is sensitive or confidential, we may hide that data from employers. We cannot guarantee that this data will not be shown to employers or others.
In the United States, Indeed may make publicly available information aggregated from various sources searchable by third parties (like Employers) through our Indeed Resume Search or Smart Sourcing offering. We make that information available on a limited basis and for a limited time to help connect you to potential Employers about their Job Listings or job opportunities, and such information is not used for apply purposes. You may remove your publicly available information from our Indeed Resume Search or Smart Sourcing offering and unsubscribe from receiving potential job opportunities from Employers by following the unsubscribe link in our messages. To delete your publicly available information from our Site, submit this
form
.
As we continue to improve the Site, you may see phrases like ‘Employers can find you’ and ‘Employers can’t find you’. For the purposes of the Terms, these phrases are synonymous with the previously employed terms ‘Searchable’ and ‘Not Searchable,’ respectively. These phrases are only a rephrasing for the purpose of enhancing user understanding, and they in no way alters the substantive rights, obligations, or protections provided under our Terms.
By creating or adding information or a resume to Your Profile, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed, or an Indeed vendor, to review or scan Your Profile and resume(s) and provide you feedback (at Indeed’s discretion), including suggested changes, other jobs you may consider applying to because your qualifications may match their requirements, and suggestions for additional information you may want to include with your application to a particular job. We may also provide you with feedback through additional resume review services, such as helping you understand how your resume or profile may be parsed by applicant tracking system software, feedback on ways to build a more effective resume or profile, or a personalized resume review video. We provide this feedback directly to you, and may give you the ability to access it within your account. It is not made available to Employers. You agree that your use of any feedback or other information provided through resume review services is at your sole discretion. You are the only one responsible for deciding which jobs to apply to and what to include in your applications. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any actions you take based on any provided feedback. Indeed does not guarantee that any recommended jobs are suited for you.
By creating or adding information to an Indeed Profile or uploading a file resume on the Site, Indeed may share with you Job Ads that match the contents of Your Profile. Indeed may also highlight to you items in Your Profile that may match qualifications from the Job Ad, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Ad and may be missing from Your Profile. These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it. Applying for such Job Ads does not guarantee job interviews or hiring. Even where Indeed highlights items or a Job Ad is shared with you, Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Ads or highlights. By uploading a file resume on the Site, you agree that Indeed may convert your file resume to a different file type. It is your responsibility to review Your Profile and resume to ensure that the content appears as you intend, and that it contains the right information or any information you intend to include or update. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so. It may take a few days for updates to your account or Your Profile to be reflected. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Your Profile or other application information you post, send or receive through the Site.
If you have an Indeed account, Indeed Resume, or an uploaded file resume, you agree that Indeed may associate any of this data with your Indeed Profile.  Your Indeed Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Profile” section of your account. This includes your Indeed Profile, your uploaded file resume or Indeed Resume, and any information that you choose to provide on the Site, such as your desired job title, job types, work schedule, qualifications, preferences, whether you are ready to work, or pay.
As we continue to improve the Site, you may be presented with the option to apply for a role using your Indeed Profile. Information in your Indeed Profile, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers. If you do not want Indeed to make your Indeed Profile available to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Indeed Profile to Not Searchable or remove information and resumes from Your Profile. When you create or upload a new version of your resume as part of an application, Indeed may automatically save that copy to your Indeed Profile. We may also offer you the option to save multiple versions of your resume to your Indeed Profile. Indeed will store the multiple versions of your resume at our discretion, and we reserve the right to discontinue storage or remove your resume from the Site for any reason, including for purposes of updates, improvements, or bug fixes without liability or notice. You are responsible for keeping your own copies of your resume. You can enable the ready to work feature on your Profile to let Employers know that you can start work immediately. Indeed may disable that feature from your Profile after a certain time, but you can manually enable it again.
To mitigate fraud, Indeed may mask or hide your contact information, for example, we may mask or hide your name, email address and/or phone number, from Your Profile, your resume, or application, and may substitute those with an alias (for example, your current or last job title in Your Profile). Indeed makes no promise to you about whether all or part of your contact info will be masked or hidden, and the decision to mask or hide such info is in Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed may also mask some or all of the Employer’s contact information, or an Employer may choose to mask their contact information when they contact you. In either case, you agree to an Employer contacting you from a masked phone number or email, and that you may not be able to return their call unless they provide their real number to you. Indeed reserves the right to limit your ability to set Your Profile to Searchable, and may toggle Your Profile to Not Searchable, at any time, to prevent illegal conduct, for fraud mitigation, or for any other reason in Indeed’s discretion. Indeed makes no guarantee that Your Profile will be shown to any particular Employer or that any portion of the Indeed Profile database will be available to an Employer at any particular time.
In certain markets, Indeed works with organizations who are involved in helping Job Seekers find opportunities. Notwithstanding the possible use of the term “partner” or “partnership,” Indeed’s engagement with these organizations does not create or imply a joint venture, partnership, principal-agent relationship, or any other form of joint enterprise between the “partner” organization and Indeed. In some instances, Indeed shares limited information back to these organizations about Job Seekers if Job Seekers agree to such sharing. For example, confirmation that a Job Seeker has created an Indeed account or used one of our Sites successfully (for example, by applying to a certain number of jobs or utilizing our career guides). These organizations may advertise their career services in partnership with Indeed. Indeed is not responsible for, and disclaims all responsibility and liability for the activities of these organizations and their career services. Indeed does not guarantee the quality or effectiveness of any advice, recommendations, guidance or services you may receive from these third parties. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Indeed will have no liability arising from any interactions you have with such a third party organization.
In connection with Indeed’s work with these organizations, Indeed may offer Job Seekers opportunities to present particular skills and qualifications on their Indeed Profile in connection with training programs or courses they have taken. Job Seekers are ultimately responsible for the contents of their resumes or Profiles, as well as their job searches and applications. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Indeed Profiles or application information that Job Seekers share with Employers or otherwise make public. Indeed makes no guarantees regarding your job application experience, that your Indeed Profile or resume will be shown to a particular Employer, that Employers will contact you, or that you will receive job interviews or job offers.
3. Applying to Jobs Through the Site
Any profile, resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application or responses to screener or other questions (“Indeed Apply”), is subject to this Agreement (including Sections D.3 and D.4.) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy (all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Indeed”,  “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references mean  “Indeed Apply.”). To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Indeed in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Indeed services.  Use of any automation, scripting, or bots to automate the Indeed Apply process outside of Indeed’s official vendors and tooling is prohibited.
Prior to submitting your application through Indeed Apply, you will be given the opportunity to review the information. It is important that you review this information carefully, including all attached files, to ensure that what is being submitted is accurate and complete, and that you are applying to your desired Employer and submitting the desired information to that Employer. You are solely responsible for the contents of the application that you submit, including all attached files. Once you provide information to an Employer (whether in the form of a job application, Indeed Profile data, resume, email, interview material or otherwise), Indeed does not have control over the Employer’s use or disclosure of that information. If you want to request the Employer delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must make such a request directly to the Employer. Unsubscribing from calls from Employers through the Site does not apply to interviews you have already scheduled. If you require alternative methods for applying, you must approach the Employer directly to request such alternative method, as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process.
When you ask Indeed to submit your application or other information through Indeed Apply, you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for the indicated Job Listing(s). You further agree to Indeed’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such processing is an essential part of this Agreement. When you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Indeed Apply or the Site’s relay system, or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message. Additionally, your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through the Site will be processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
You acknowledge and agree that Employers may request that Indeed assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, and other information you provide to Indeed into one document, and you agree that in doing so, Indeed assembles these application materials on your behalf. When you apply to a job using Indeed Apply, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent, which may include sending your application to an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or other service provider selected by the Employer. You agree that Employers can enable such service providers to access and manage their Indeed accounts, including by connecting to and integrating with APIs provided or used by Indeed. By applying for a job through the Site, you agree to Employer’s use of such service providers, and acknowledge that such use may involve an intermediary’s access to job applications sent to its Employer client. We cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. Indeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. Indeed depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Indeed with the correct destination for all applications, and we cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by Employers. If the electronic destination provided to Indeed is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application. Further, Indeed does not guarantee that its integrations or the interface will be error-free. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
Job Ads may expire or otherwise be removed between the time you submit your application and the time it is received, in which cases your application will be void. Employers and third-party sites (including but not limited to ATSs) may reject applications for other reasons, such as duplicate applications, in which cases your application will be void. Indeed has no responsibility for expired or removed Job Ads, for delivering applications prior to a Job Ad’s expiration or removal, or for delivering applications that an Employer or third-party site, including but not limited to an ATS has otherwise rejected. Indeed and its third-party providers may store your application and related information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer available on the Site. We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third-party sites, including but not limited to ATSs. Third-party sites, including ATSs used by Employers, may disclaim liability for technical malfunctions, including the failure in the delivery of applications. We are not responsible if an ATS rejects or fails to deliver an application to an Employer for any reason. If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored by Indeed on Indeed’s or third-party providers’ servers, do not use the Indeed Apply or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public mail system. You may contact the Employer directly to find alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through the Site.
By using the Site, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s job application, requirements, messages, screener questions, skills assessments or their format or method of delivery, and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer. Please note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers. Employers are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar laws, anti-discrimination laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and any applicable data protection or privacy laws.
Employers are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law.
You must contact the Employer if you require alternative methods of screening. Some questions may be labeled as Optional, indicating only that the application may be submitted to the Employer without providing an answer. Indeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will consider such an application or make a particular determination with regard to such an application. Employers may ask applicants to voluntarily self-identify certain demographic information such as race, ethnicity, sex, disability and/or veteran status along with their job applications. Some Employers are required by law to ask these questions and you may see these questions when applying to jobs on the the Site. That is a separate process from Indeed’s collection of demographic data (see section 11, “Your Job Seeker Data,” below). Indeed is not responsible for these questions. If you have questions or concerns about an Employer’s application materials, please contact the Employer directly or refer to their privacy policy. Indeed does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs. Indeed cannot make any guarantee regarding health and safety measures in an Employer’s hiring or interviewing process. Indeed recommends Job Seekers follow personal health and safety best practices as recommended by the World Health Organization or similar institution.
Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations. Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.
By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought by the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections. Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist. Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application. These notices are automatically sent after a period of time selected by the Employer, unless the Employer indicates to Indeed their interest in your application. You acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer’s decision to activate Employer Assist and to not take an action on your application on the Site within the time period selected by the Employer. Any interactions the Employer has directly with you and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and would not by themselves prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent. Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Employer Assist notices.
By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to schedule interviews with Job Seekers who meet criteria (based on information the Job Seeker has provided to Indeed, such as answers to screener questions, resume or other information) that the Employers have selected, and based on the Employers’ availability. You agree that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these interview invitations (which are purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the availability or criteria the Employer provided to Indeed may not be accurate. Indeed may request that Job Seekers confirm their interest in the position before scheduling an interview. It is ultimately your and the Employer’s responsibility to confirm whether any interviews were scheduled, or to reschedule or cancel interviews if necessary. The decision of who to interview is decided solely by the Employer, who can choose to interview any Job Seeker at any time.
Indeed may offer Employers functionality that groups applicants based on whether they meet or may meet Employers’ criteria, based on text in their resumes or answers to screener questions. In all cases, Employers can view any applicant at any time, and Indeed makes no decisions about any applicant. You agree that such functionality does not constitute or contribute to a decision, and is not a substitute for human discretion and review. The Employer is solely responsible for its screening and hiring decisions.
When you search for jobs on the Indeed Job Search app and proceed to apply for a job, including jobs on third party sites, the Site may suggest information from your Indeed profile to include in your application. It is your responsibility to review suggestions before accepting them and including them on your application.
For Job Seekers located in Japan, you acknowledge that when Indeed is presented as Indeed Agent (hereinafter referred to as “Indeed Agent Japan”), Indeed is acting as an employment placement business provider (as defined under applicable law). Indeed Agent Japan offers the services in accordance with these terms and the rules set forth in
its website
. Indeed Agent Japan will only send you Job Listings that Indeed Agent Japan determines may be of interest to you. You may also end your relationship with Indeed Agent Japan at any time.
You acknowledge that as part of its efforts to combat fraud and spam, Indeed may require that users verify their email address. When you apply to a job through the Site, you agree that you may be required to verify your email address, and that failure to verify may lead to your application being rejected.
4. Job Matching and Recommended Jobs
Job matches are recommendations which may be presented to both you as a Job Seeker and to Employers in various formats on the Site. For example, Indeed may recommend Job Ads which are similar to jobs to which you recently applied, highlight certain aspects of Job Ads to you, or recommend Indeed Profiles to Employers which match Job Ads they post. Job matching is provided to you on a beta basis and is subject to our Beta Program (see section 9 of the Terms of Service for All Users).
To generate matches, Indeed uses data collected through our Site from both Employers and Job Seekers. This includes Job Ads, Your Profile information, information from your resume(s), your application materials (including responses to screener questions), and your activity on the Site (such as searches you run and Job Ads you click on and apply to). Indeed may use this information to present potential matches to you and to potential Employers.
Indeed may automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to apply to a job or the email that is associated with your Indeed account.
If you do not want to receive alerts for jobs that Indeed recommends to you, you can turn off ‘recommended jobs’ in your communications settings within your Indeed account.
If you do not want Your Profile, including your resume, to be matched by an Employer on the Site then you can set your information to ‘Not Searchable’ in Your Profile settings.
5. Communications and Other Actions on the Site
When you view, send, store or receive communications or materials (including Job Listings, resumes, messages, text messages, chats, emails, applications, questions and responses in applications, interview or other voice recordings or transcripts, and any other information)  to, on or through the Site, you agree to your activities, communication and materials being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service. To achieve these purposes, we use this data to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Indeed also uses vendors as an extension of the Site to collect, record, process, analyze, and store communication data. If you disagree with any part of these terms, do not use the Site.
When an Employer views, sends, stores or receives communications or materials to, on or through the Site, Indeed may inform you about such actions. Additionally, we may also inform you that an Employer has taken other actions with regards to a Job Ad, Your Profile, or your application, such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening Your Profile or application, viewing Your Profile or application, responding to Your Profile or application, and making a decision with regards to your application or Job Ad. As part of this functionality, you may receive notifications via the app, SMS, email or platform corresponding with your or an Employer’s (in the event you applied for a job) activity on or use of the Site, Indeed Apply, Indeed Messaging, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site. In all cases, such notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them. For example, if you accept an interview request, it is your responsibility to follow up with the employer separately to ensure they know your response, do not rely on notifications through the Site. Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message interview reminder from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled interviews with you. In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your phone number and that you have the right to accept text messages at the number. Indeed will only send you text message reminders for your interviews, and you agree to accept such text message reminders on your cell phone, including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system. You acknowledge that if the words “automated,” “automatic,” or similar words are used on the Site in connection with calls or text messages, these words do not refer to the generation or storage of a phone number. Indeed only calls the number that you generated and stored when you provided your number to Indeed. In the event you change your phone number, you agree to promptly update your Indeed account with the new number. You agree that by providing your phone number or using the Site, you are establishing a business relationship with Indeed and that Indeed may send you text messages in connection with that relationship.
Indeed may enable in-app messaging services (“Indeed Messaging”), as well as text messaging relay, email relay, and/or call relay services through our Site directly or through vendors to help facilitate contact between Employers and Job Seekers about a Job Listing. Indeed may also enable you and/or Employers to connect with each other on Indeed Messaging via third-party providers. You understand that communicating through Indeed Messaging and/or other communication options on or through the Site shall be limited to the purpose of applying for a Job Listing. Indeed reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to turn off or disable Indeed Messaging or other communication options for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice and for any or no reason. Please note that since relay services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays and other errors on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to send or receive communications, such as text messages, emails or calls.  We also do not guarantee that Indeed’s integrations with these third-party providers or interface will be error-free. Further, we do not guarantee that communications sent to or through Indeed Messaging will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.  In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
Indeed may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Employer. Once an Employer has your contact info, you agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the manner in which the Employer uses the info. When you or an Employer send a message to an Indeed provided alias, Indeed and its vendors will process the message to offer you services, display your message on the Site, and for other purposes as provided in this Agreement. For example, when you send or receive a message to an Indeed alias via email, Indeed will decide how and what to extract and display  on Indeed Messaging. Some messages related to the same conversation may not be grouped together. Indeed may also group messages together as part of a conversation on Indeed Messaging.  This is done as a courtesy, and some messages related to the same conversation may not be grouped together. When communicating with an Employer through the Site, the Employer sender’s information and any other conversation participant’s information may be displayed in different ways depending on the platform (browser or mobile) and whether the participant has an Indeed account. For example, you may see their Indeed account user name or company name, “Employer” or “Employee #”, “Guest (added from email)”, or as the email account sender display name of the person sending the message, if available, but you may not see all that info in all circumstances. You agree to not use Indeed Messaging to send bulk messages, unless specifically authorized in the Indeed interface. You agree to not circumvent this limitation through using your email service provider for this purpose, for example by sending email messages through your email service provider (e.g. your Gmail or third party email provider) to multiple Indeed aliased e-mail addresses. If a user, such as an Employer, sends an email to multiple recipients (e.g. by adding additional aliased email addresses to the cc field in a third party email client), this may affect the way messages on the Site are displayed. In this case, it is best to view the email conversation in the third party email client. Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you are communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias. You agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the content of any message or call from you or Employers. You further agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the manner in which you or Employers use Indeed Messaging or other communication options.
Indeed may offer you the opportunity to link a third-party email client to the Site for Indeed to scan your emails in your third-party email account and add job application updates to the “My jobs” page within your Indeed account. If you choose to use this feature, Indeed will automatically scan your emails and extract data that it identifies as being relevant to application statuses. The updates will not be limited to applications submitted on or through the Site, and will include applications submitted outside the Site as well. You agree to your extracted data being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Site’s rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service. Indeed does not guarantee that the updates to the job applications listed on the “My jobs” page within your Indeed account will be accurate or complete. You may turn off this feature at any time via your email settings.
Indeed may also insert functionality into messages relating to your application allowing you to place calls directly to third parties. Please note this functionality is provided solely as a courtesy. Your standard calling rates with your phone provider will apply.
Indeed may enable chatbots and other interactive experiences, which allow you to take certain actions on the Site, such as apply to a job, schedule an interview, or otherwise interact with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (“Chatbots”). You acknowledge and agree that Indeed collects, records, processes, analyzes, and stores any and all communications that you have with a Chatbot or other interactive features on the Site for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Site’s rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service. To achieve these purposes, we use this data to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Indeed uses vendors as an extension of the Site to collect, record, process, analyze, and store this data.
Chatbots are automated services that do not involve human interaction. Our Chatbots are also AI-Generated Content subject to our Beta Terms (see the “Other Services” section of our Terms of Service for All Users). For example, Indeed provides an AI interactive experience aimed at helping Job Seekers get personalized job recommendations and explore new career opportunities. Indeed uses data from your Indeed Profile and other data you choose to share with it to generate responses and suggestions. To the extent that AI-Generated Content contains personal information, it will be handled by Indeed in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy. Indeed does not act as an employment agency by providing such services.
It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information submitted through a Chatbot. Use of AI-Generated Content may in some situations result in incorrect output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You should evaluate the accuracy of any AI-Generated Content as appropriate. Indeed is not responsible for any loss, damage or inconvenience arising as a consequence of the use (or inability to use) a Chatbot, from the information you submit via a Chatbot, or from any outputs by a Chatbot.
Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify you that chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer. For example, you may see an option to chat with an Employer before applying to certain jobs. Whether or not you see that option depends on many factors, including whether the Employer turned on that functionality and the Employer and/ or Job Listing meet certain requirements. Indeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice.
If you have turned on browser push notifications and wish to turn them off, you may do so by visiting the settings on your browser. If you have turned on mobile push notifications and wish to turn them off, you may do so through your mobile device.
It is possible to create an Indeed account with a phone number only and no email address (“PNO Accounts”) in certain countries. If you create a PNO Account, you understand and agree that there are limitations to using such an account. Such limitations include the following: (i) if you forget your password, you may not be able to recover it or regain access to your PNO Account and the data contained in your PNO Account, (ii) if you change your phone number, you will lose access to your PNO Account if you do not change the phone number on your PNO Account before you lose access to your old number and (iii) you can only create a PNO Account if you have a WhatsApp account. If you forget your password, you may be given the option to regain access to your PNO Account in some limited circumstances (“Forgot Password Option”). If you want to proceed with the Forgot Password Option, you must ensure that you have access to the phone number associated with your PNO Account. If the phone number associated with your PNO Account has been recycled or a third party has access to it, there is a risk that a third party could access your PNO Account.
To unsubscribe at any time from non-transactional WhatsApp messages connected to your PNO Account, reply STOP by WhatsApp to the relevant message. DUE TO THE UNSTRUCTURED CONVERSATIONAL FORMAT OF THIS SERVICE, WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OTHER UNSUBSCRIBE ATTEMPTS. Please note that since PNO Accounts depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical issues on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to send or receive WhatsApp messages. You represent and warrant that you are the subscriber and primary user of the telephone number registered on your PNO Account. Indeed accepts no liability regarding phone numbers in PNO accounts being recycled or Job Seekers losing access to such phone numbers.
Short Code Text Messages
If you have consented to receiving text messages (i) about employer messages and upcoming interviews scheduled on the Site (“Employer Responses and Interview Updates”) or (ii) from Employers interested in Your Profile (“Recruiter Invites”), the terms in this paragraph apply to you. Employer Responses and Interview Updates may include employer messages, confirmation messages, messages reminding you about upcoming interviews and messages regarding interview cancellations. You can cancel the Employer Responses and Interview Updates and Recruiter Invites at any time by texting “STOP” to the relevant short code or by opting-out via Communication Settings. If you want to unsubscribe from both categories of messages you must text “STOP” to both short codes. After you send the text message “STOP”, we will send you a text message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive Employer Responses and Interview Updates or Recruiter Invites messages (as applicable). If you want to join again, sign up as you did the first time or opt-in via Communication Settings and we will start sending the relevant messages. Please note if you want to receive Recruiter Invites, your Resume must also be set to Searchable. If you are experiencing issues with the messaging program you can reply with the keyword “HELP” for more assistance, or you can visit our
Help Center
. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. Message and data rates may apply for (i) any messages sent by you to Indeed, and by Indeed to you and (ii) any calls to or from Indeed. Message frequency varies. If you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, it is best to contact your wireless provider.
6. Virtual Communications
Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in virtual, pre-recorded, and remote communications using Indeed products, including but not limited to, Indeed Interview, Indeed Hiring Platform, Virtual Evaluations, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”). You understand that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider and that Indeed is only providing the option for you to communicate with Employers via services that may be offered by third-party providers. Please note that since these telecommunication services may depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays or malfunctions on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive, transmit, or support such phone or video communications. Indeed does not guarantee any aspect of your Virtual Interview experience including transmission of phone or video communications, quality of audio/visual content, data security, or data usage and restrictions.
Indeed is not liable for any claims arising out of your use of Virtual Interviews and you release Indeed from any such claims.
You understand that Indeed does not guarantee the Employer’s schedule or availability for conducting Virtual Interviews and cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us. You also understand that the Employer is responsible for any and all questions, comments, or hiring decisions made. Further, Employers are responsible for any accommodations you need during Virtual Interviews.
NOTICE – Virtual Interviews May be Recorded: You understand that an Employer may enable the recording of a Virtual Interview or you may be given the option to pre-record an interview to provide to the Employer. You agree to respect any notification (visual, audio, or otherwise) which may indicate that recording is enabled by or on behalf of an Employer on Virtual Interview. If you do not agree to be recorded, you must refrain from pre-recording an interview or you must immediately leave the Virtual Interview. By using Virtual Interviews, you agree that the Virtual Interview may be recorded and that Indeed and third party providers can store, access and analyze the recording.  Also, you agree that an Employer that receives pre-recorded interviews or activates the recording function, can access, store, use, analyze, and share the recording, and that this activity is outside of Indeed’s control. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT INDEED IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE RECORDING OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS, AND YOU RELEASE INDEED FROM ANY SUCH CLAIMS.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE OR DATA THAT YOU TRANSMIT WHILE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT, INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, OR YOUR IMAGE OR LIKENESS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, INDEED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OR PROTECTING ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT DURING YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. INDEED ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR THE MISUSE OF ANY DATA YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT THROUGH USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INDEED DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR AVAILABILITY OR RETENTION OF ANY RECORDINGS OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
7. Screening Tools
Indeed may make screening tools available to Employers for Employer use in the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and assessments. Indeed is licensing these tools for Employers’ use as determined by Employers. As a Job Seeker you agree that the Employer has made the determination to use these tools as part of its application process, and the questions asked are solely determined by the Employer, and are not being asked by Indeed. The Employer is the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate and is solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact”.
Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering screening tools. By using screening tools, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers. Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Job Seekers to exchange information as they determine. The sole responsibility for the content of any screening tools, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of screening tools, is solely with Employers or Job Seekers as applicable.
You further acknowledge that only the Employer is responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law. While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, each disability is unique and Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.
8. Career Services
Indeed may offer you resume review, resume scan, offer coaching, live video consulting sessions, writing services, general career guidance, or other consultation services (collectively, “Career Services”). By using Career Services, you request that Indeed, or an Indeed vendor, provide you with the service you select according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy. You may only use Career Services for advice concerning your own resume, offer, or employment situation and not another person’s.  As a user of the Site, Indeed may also, from time to time, provide you career or hiring guides via blog posts, email, chatbots, AI-Generated Content, or other channels as part of its services to you. For example, Indeed may provide tips on improving your resume or how to use your resume effectively in the job application process, commonly asked interview questions, next steps after you have submitted an application, how to prepare for a new job after you have been hired, or assist you with exploring new career opportunities. Indeed offers these Career Services as optional guidelines for its users and all liability with respect to actions taken or not taken based on the contents of such Career Services are hereby expressly disclaimed.
When filling out forms associated with Career Services, you agree to provide complete and accurate information. Any information you upload through the forms, including a resume, constitutes User Content and shall be treated in accordance with any User Content sections herein. Any career-related or hiring-related information, feedback, guides, AI-Generated Content, or other content provided by Indeed, or Indeed’s vendors, through Career Services or otherwise, is for informational purposes only, and is in no way to be construed as professional career counseling or staffing services (unless otherwise expressly noted by Indeed in services such as Indeed Agent in Japan). You understand that Indeed may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search. You further understand that in providing any such career or hiring guides, Indeed is not acting as a job placement agency or staffing firm (unless otherwise expressly noted by Indeed in services such as Indeed Agent in Japan). You are responsible for reviewing any career or hiring-related information provided to you, for example, for accuracy and completeness. You are also responsible for editing the information before you use it, for example, for an employment application. Indeed is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information that Indeed or its vendor provides you.  You understand that by using Career Services or referring to or using any career or hiring information, you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement, assurance of being hired, or a higher salary or increased benefit,  and you take full responsibility for use of these services or information.
Indeed owns all rights in Career Services and other career and hiring-related material that Indeed provides you, such as video feedback and hiring tips. By using Career Services, Indeed grants you an express, non-exclusive, non-assignable, and non-sublicensable right and license to use materials developed by Indeed or Indeed vendors for you. This license is limited to personal and non-commercial use and any further use is prohibited.
Indeed may offer, as part of Career Services, the opportunity for you to engage with third parties, sometimes referred to as career coaches or professional writers, to discuss job search, resume writing, or career strategies, either through the Site or in person. Regardless of how you interact with them, you acknowledge that these third parties are not employees of Indeed and that Indeed is not responsible for the content of any such discussion or any actions taken or not taken based on the contents of such discussion. Do not share any information you consider confidential or personally sensitive with these third parties. Indeed does not guarantee the quality or effectiveness of any advice, recommendations, or guidance you may receive from these third parties. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Indeed will have no liability arising from any discussion you have with such a third party. Further, the live video service functionality in Career Services utilizes a video platform created by the third party, Whereby. By using any feature of Career Services that involves live video services, you agree to Whereby’s
privacy policy
.
Career Services Payment, Cancellation, and Termination
. To the extent that you use a paid Career Services offering, you shall be charged as indicated on the Site. Subject to the limited cancellation rights described below, refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form Indeed finds appropriate in its sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card, bank account, and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors.
Consumer’s Right to Cancel
The following cancellation provision is applicable only to Job Seekers who are residents of British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and who have purchased a Career Services offering:
You may cancel your purchase of Career Services from the day you enter into the contract until ten (10) days after you receive the services. You do not need a reason to cancel. If you do not receive the services within thirty (30) days of the date stated in the contract, you may cancel the contract within one (1) year of the contract date. Any acceptance of delivery beyond the thirty (30) day threshold forfeits such rights. You lose that right if you accept delivery after the 30 days. There are other grounds for extended cancellation. For more information, you may contact your provincial consumer affairs office. If you cancel your purchase of Career Services, Indeed shall have fifteen (15) days to refund your money. To cancel, please contact Indeed, Inc. at career-services@indeed.com.
Termination
Indeed may cancel all or part of Career Services or we may suspend your access to Career Services at our sole discretion, at any time, with or without prior notice. If you wish to terminate your use of Career Services, you may do so at any time. Indeed may also, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer Career Services to anyone, without providing a reason.
9. Salary and Other Information Provided by Indeed
Indeed may provide salary and other information and content to users for informational purposes only. For example, Indeed may provide you with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, number of applies to a Job Listing, responses to certain screener questions for a Job Listing, or the likelihood that a particular event will occur such as being selected for an interview. This information provided by Indeed is based on estimates given for informational purposes only and without warranty, and is subject to change or varying levels of accuracy. Please note that all salary figures displayed on the Site are approximations based on different criteria, including AI-Generated Content or multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates. These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only. Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, “Responsive Employer” or “Active Employer” or “Hired on Indeed” or “Verified”. Employers may also request that Indeed add such labels. Indeed shall determine the method by which such labels or badges are determined or which Employers qualify. The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies. Some of the data may be provided by the Employer and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such data. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge that is added to Employer names or Job Ads. Indeed may add labels or badges to Job Ads – such as pay types, specialties, benefits, or union associations – based on data contained within the job description for informational purposes only. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge that is added to Employer names or Job Ads, including data on Job Ads.
Indeed may also display publicly available information about employers on Company Pages. Information on Company Pages is presented for informational and promotional purposes only, is subject to change, and may be gathered from or generated by third parties. Please contact the Employer for the most accurate and up-to-date company information.
10. Your Job Seeker Data
As a Job Seeker, you take a variety of actions on our Site and you provide various information. For example, you search for jobs, and Indeed knows and stores the titles of jobs you search for and click on, where those jobs are located, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (if indicated on the Job Listings), the Job Listings you apply to, your amount of activity or time of most recent activity on the Site, and any other information you provide directly to Indeed including desired salary, past experience, any information in your Indeed Profile, and any of your other behavior on the Site. You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who provided the information or undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity. By using the Site, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed collects, records, processes, analyzes, and stores any and all information you provide and activities you take on the Site, and any and all interactions and communications you have with, on, or through the Site. You further acknowledge and agree that Indeed may inform the Employer about activities you take on the Site or your use of the Site, for example, whether you are online, recently active, or active on Indeed, and whether you are responsive to Employer messages on Indeed.
When you initiate a job application on a website operated by an Employer or its applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as via API, cookies, pixels and web beacons. The information collected includes, for example, information about Job Listings you viewed and job applications you started and completed. An Employer who provides tracker functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law. However, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no control over such an Employer or its website. You agree to Indeed’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such tracker functionality.
You agree that any data contained in or associated with Your Profile may be used to suggest jobs to you and to suggest you or your Profile to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on the Site.  You also agree that Indeed may contact you based on this observed behavior or provided info on behalf of Employers or Indeed itself. Please note, the aforementioned actions do not include information sent to you by a third party, however, Indeed may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Indeed Site to correspond with a third party. In addition, if Your Profile is set to Searchable, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with third-party Employers. If you do not wish to share such information, you may set Your Profile to Not Searchable. When you make changes to your Indeed Profile, including, but not limited to, updating, deleting, or changing settings, it may take a few days for the changes to be reflected.
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Job Seeker profiles, such as “Responsive Candidate” or “New Applicant.”  Indeed determines the method by which such labels or badges are added or which Job Seekers qualify based solely on Job Seeker activity on Indeed. The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if a Job Seeker qualifies. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge, and reserves the right to change or remove such label or badge features at any time and in Indeed’s sole discretion.
You may have the opportunity to provide Indeed with certain demographic information about yourself, such as your race and ethnicity, gender, age, LGBTQ+ community membership, and disability status, as well as whether you have an arrest or conviction record (“demographic data”). By choosing to provide your demographic data you agree that Indeed may use it to evaluate and improve our products, and share aggregate summaries of job seeker information with employers. If you do not want your demographic data to be used in this way, do not provide it to Indeed (or, if you have already provided your demographic data to Indeed, you can request it be removed). You further acknowledge and agree that another Job Seeker’s demographic data is personal information, and to the extent permitted by law you waive any right to request or view demographic data pertaining to any other Job Seeker.
Please note that Indeed may be required to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. This means, for example, that Indeed may receive legal process from courts or law enforcement to reveal user data, including demographic data.
Please also note that some Employers may ask applicants to voluntarily self-identify certain demographic information such as race, ethnicity, sex, disability and/or veteran status along with their job applications. Some Employers are required by law to ask these questions and you may see these questions when applying to jobs on Indeed. That is a separate process from Indeed’s collection of demographic data, and Indeed is not responsible for these questions. If you have questions or concerns about an Employer’s application materials, please contact the Employer directly or refer to their privacy policy.
11. Indeed Hiring Platform
Indeed Hiring Platform is a platform designed to streamline Employer hiring and employment decision- making processes by allowing users access to various products such as Indeed Interview and related services (“Indeed Hiring Platform”). Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in hiring activities that might be supported by Indeed Hiring Platform. You acknowledge and understand that Employers select the method and manner that Indeed Hiring Platform will be used for its job openings and that the Employer determines the job requirements and specific needs of its hiring efforts. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT EMPLOYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE LAW REGARDING ITS EMPLOYMENT AND HIRING PRACTICES, INCLUDING TITLE VII, AND THAT EMPLOYER INDEMNIFIES INDEED AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM EMPLOYER’S USE OF INDEED HIRING PLATFORM OR SIMILAR PRODUCTS. INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT EMPLOYER’S USE OF THE SERVICES COMPLIES WITH TITLE VII OR ANY SIMILAR LAW. Indeed has no control nor participates in the hiring or decision-making process regarding Employer hiring efforts. Further, you understand that Indeed is not an employment agency by offering Indeed Hiring Platform and related tools. By using Indeed Hiring Platform, you understand that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employer or opportunities for Job Seekers. Indeed merely provides Indeed Hiring platform as a tool that enables Employers and Job Seekers to exchange information as they determine.
12. Indeed Hire
Indeed Hire provides recruitment services to its clients. When you apply to a job supported by Indeed Hire, or otherwise engage with Indeed Hire as a Job Seeker, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed Hire may use the Site and its tools as an agent to Employers, such as Indeed Apply, Virtual Interviews, and other screening tools. You further agree that Indeed Hire may use information you provide to Indeed Hire and data collected through the Site to present potential job matches to you and to potential Employers.
Employers retaining Indeed Hire are solely responsible for determining their job requirements, the specific needs of their hiring efforts, and their hiring decisions. By engaging with Indeed Hire, you understand that you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement, suitability for a particular position, or assurance of being hired, and you take full responsibility for your own decisions and actions during the recruitment process, including the acceptance or rejection of job offers.
13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or related in any way to the Site (“Dispute”) will be governed as to all matters, including, but not limited to the validity, construction and performance of this Agreement, by and under the laws of the State of Texas, United States of America, if you are located in the United States, or the laws of the Republic of Ireland, if you are located elsewhere, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles thereof. Any and all actions, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings related to such Dispute shall be filed only in courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A., if you are located in the United States, or Dublin, Ireland, if you are located elsewhere. Each of the parties hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A, if you are located in the United States of America, or Dublin, Ireland, if you are located elsewhere. Despite the application of Irish law, if you are a consumer resident in the EU, you also enjoy the protection of the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you have your habitual residence. The application of mandatory provisions limiting the choice of law and in particular the application of mandatory laws of the country in which you have your habitual residence, such as consumer protection laws, shall remain unaffected.
You also hereby waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to your use of the Site or these terms of service, if you are located in the United States.
14. Class Action Waiver

As partial consideration for your use of the Site and the Publisher Program, you agree not to sue Indeed as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against Indeed regarding your use of the Site. Additionally, as a Job Seeker, you acknowledge that your use of job search, Indeed Apply, and other free services on the Site is not purchased. Your acceptance of this Agreement, including this Class Action Waiver, is an essential part of the bargain allowing your free use of the Site. If you do not agree to any part of these terms, do not continue your use of the Site.

B. Terms of Service for Employers
The following terms and conditions apply to all Employers and other users who access or use the Site as intended for individuals and/or organizations seeking to make available information regarding employment openings, on their behalf or other’s behalf, including but not limited to agencies purchasing for multiple parties, or otherwise indicate their acceptance to this Agreement. You further agree that the
Terms of Service for All Users
also apply. For the avoidance of doubt where the Terms of Service for All Users overlap or conflict with the Terms of Service for Employers, you agree that the Terms of Service for Employers will govern.
For purposes of this Section B of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as an Employer or other user as described above.
1. Employer Accounts
When you create an Indeed account, a Company Page or post job listings advertising employment opportunities and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”) on the Site, whether as part of the Indeed Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement (including the
Data Processing Agreement
), the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using, and all of Indeed’s policies, including the
Indeed Privacy Policy
and
Cookie Policy
, apply to you.
When you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity. You may be presented with different options for verification, including verification via a third party service such as ID.me or Persona (“Third Party Verification Services”). When using Third Party Verification Services, you will be providing your information to our Third Party Verification Services, and engaging with them directly. You agree that ID.me is solely responsible for any collection, use, storage, processing, or loss of data you provide to them, and any legal obligations related to such activities, including the capture or storage of any biometric identification or biometric identifiers. You also agree that Persona is responsible for any collection, use, storage, processing, or loss of data you provide to them, and any legal obligations related to such activities, including the capture or storage of any biometric identification or biometric identifiers. Indeed does not collect any biometric information or biometric identifiers, or receive any biometric information or biometric identifiers from the Third Party Verification Services.
When you access or use the Site in your capacity as an employee or other representative of an Employer, or if you create an Indeed account on behalf of an Employer, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Employer to this Agreement. When you create an account on behalf of an Employer, the account belongs to the Employer, and you acknowledge that any and all information that you provide Indeed through the account, such as the actions you take and when you take them, will be visible to the Employer. As part of this account you may have an individual profile (“Employer Profile”). Your Employer Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Account Settings” and “Employer Settings” section of the account.
As an Employer, your account is for business use and not for personal use. Indeed is not responsible for and disclaims all liability if your email is used improperly or falsely by a third party. By registering for an Indeed account, you agree to receive mandatory email updates regarding account activity to your Indeed account. If you attempt to send an email from a name or email address that is not true, accurate, current or complete, we reserve the right to drop such email, and attempting to send such email is a violation of our terms. Employers may request that Indeed disable an account at any time by contacting the
Employer Help Center
. Please note that Indeed may be required to preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law. Alternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in the “Your Personal data rights” section of this
Privacy Policy
.
In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (“a Linked Account”). A Linked Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (“Admins”) of an Employer account invites other users to the same account. Admin(s) and other designated users can provide these other users varying levels of access and functionality (“Roles”) within the account, as described on the site, such as accessing account data, including candidate Personal Data, contained in the account of the user who initiated the invite, or purchasing services from Indeed under such account. If you are an Admin or another designated user adding a user to a Role or several Roles, you represent to Indeed that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have the authority to allow this data and access to be shared. You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Indeed from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs) that result from the sharing of this data, access to your account, and any purchases made under your account. When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may have access to any or all account information, such as: communications and actions of all other users and applicants within the Linked Account, resume contacts, and billing information, and you consent to such access. When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may also have the ability to purchase Indeed products under your account, and you agree that you are responsible for the payment of all such purchases made. If you accept another user’s invitation to link your Employer account to their Employer account, you acknowledge that any and all information about your activity in your Employer account, such as the actions you take and when you take them, will be visible to all linked users. Administrators of Linked Accounts may retain certain information Linked Account users provide, such as an email address used to receive applications. Linked Account users will not be able to see your activity, such as your job searches, applications or preferences or your Indeed Profile information, contained in your Job Seeker account.  You may visit your account settings at any time to unlink your account.  The Admin assigned to an Employer account may also unlink any user from that Employer account at any time, and may be notified if your Linked Account is used to login from too many devices.
If your Indeed employer account has a credit card or other payment method on file, such as bank account information for Automatic Clearing House (“ACH”) payment, Indeed may charge that payment method for any products or services you order and for any outstanding payments, including to correct billing errors.
You agree that Indeed may send notices to Job Seekers informing them that an Employer account has been compromised, including if such account is associated with you. Indeed cannot and does not guarantee that such notices will always be sent or received, and you therefore agree that Indeed bears no responsibility for doing so. Indeed makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices.
Indeed may offer suggestions, recommendations, or information to users that may support or improve their experience on Indeed Sites. You understand that these offerings are provided as a courtesy and without warranty, and your use of such information is at your sole discretion. As an Employer, you are responsible for your use of the Site and any tools offered therein, including your decisions regarding your job description, the requirements for your job, compliance with applicable laws, including relevant federal, state, and local laws related to job postings, and whom you interview or hire. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any actions you take based on any information provided by Indeed. Indeed may limit your ability to post a job, or the visibility of your job, if it does not appear to indicate a salary above minimum wage, wage transparency laws, or does not comply with other applicable law; however Indeed is not responsible for, and you are solely responsible for, compliance with minimum wage, local language and other legal requirements.
If you are an Indeed agency partner, you may be eligible to participate in an Indeed partnership program. Agency partners in this program may attain the rank of “Gold”, “Silver”, or “Bronze” based on their Indeed usage and engagement, measured by revenue. Indeed’s determination of an agency’s rank is made at Indeed’s full discretion and may be revoked at any time.
Indeed may offer you the ability to delete candidate and application information stored in your candidate dashboard. If you delete this candidate and application information, you acknowledge that you will no longer be able to access it through Indeed and that the deletion cannot be undone. You agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing employment records, job application materials or data on your behalf, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements or other applicable law.
2. Employer Services Including Indeed Apply and Screener Questions
You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Indeed may activate its Indeed Apply relay function for use in connection with your Job Listings, and that any Job Seeker may indicate interest in Job Listings through Indeed Apply, and that Indeed will send applications to the email address you provide. You also agree that Indeed may activate a chatbot, which enables Job Seekers to apply to your Job Ad by answering questions. The answers a Job Seeker submits are presented to you as a job application. When you use Indeed candidate management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may make available functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate. You agree that if you use such candidate management tools, Indeed may assemble the candidate’s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, and other information the candidate provides to Indeed into one document or webpage. You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention, reporting requirements or other applicable law. By using these tools any information shared through the Site will be processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Indeed may store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled. Candidate Summaries may be provided by Indeed for certain Job Seekers in the Candidate Details page. These Summaries are populated with information from the Job Seeker and information provided by you in the Job Description. Candidate Summaries are not a recommendation for employment. Employers agree to review the full application and not to use such summaries as the basis for employment decisions.
In a Candidate Summary or other product or service on the Site, you may see a verification of a Job Seeker’s skills, certifications, or other qualifications.  Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such verifications or information, and you are solely responsible for verifying information on the Site.
Whether you are using the Site directly or any ATS you are responsible for the contents of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, criteria you set for inviting candidates to interview, Company Pages that you create, update, or manage, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Indeed Apply or otherwise, and agree that Indeed is not responsible for such content and disclaims all liability for such content, including as to whether such content is legal. You agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with applicable law for all content on the Site, including minimum wage requirements, wage transparency laws, or any other law. If you include voluntary self-identification questions for Job Seekers along with your application materials, you are solely responsible for compliance with applicable laws related to such questions, including the content and format of the questions and your use of the Job Seekers’ responses. You are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements related to collecting and reporting demographic information about applicants.
If you close or change any Job Listings that you post, you agree to promptly update such Job Listings on the Site or otherwise notify Indeed.  Indeed may provide you with a mechanism for responding to requests for accommodations from Job Seekers.
You are responsible for ensuring that your selection criteria are job-related, that you do not pose “disability-related inquiries” or medical inquiries in violation of the law, and that you do not screen out people with disabilities or members of any protected category under the law. You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law. You are responsible for clearly indicating that reasonable accommodations are available, engaging with and responding to any requests for accommodation, and providing information about how to request an accommodation to Job Seekers.
You agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason. For example, Indeed may remove any Job Listing or question that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers. Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing, requirement, or question specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability. Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing, requirement, or question implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing, requirement, or question that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers or otherwise violates applicable law.
You understand and agree that you are responsible for ensuring that your Job Listing requirements and criteria are job-related and in compliance with applicable law.
Indeed does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. You are solely responsible for checking your Employer dashboard to view job applications and other information. Any notifications, such as emails, you may receive about applications or other activities, are provided solely as a courtesy to you and you should not rely on them.
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable. If you do not feel comfortable sending a message, such as an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Indeed’s relay functions, do not use the Indeed relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via another method. When using the Indeed Apply function, Indeed will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Indeed by you, however, Indeed has no ability to verify the contact information provided by you. In the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Indeed for any damages resulting therefrom.
Should you post any Job Listings for Job Seekers in any country (including but not limited to Japan) where the cross-border transfer of personal data is regulated (such as requiring user consent), you warrant and agree that you will not cause or allow a cross-border transfer of personal data from the Site to you that violates or is contrary to the applicable data protection laws. For example, you will take such actions to ensure that any resultant job applications and other personal data to be sent or directed to your designated contact information (including an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or other service provider selected by you) either through Indeed Apply or other relay functions shall be accessed or received by you at your business location in such country.
When Job Seekers apply or RSVP to your Job Listing, Indeed may give them the opportunity to provide certain demographic information to Indeed, such as race and ethnicity, gender, age, LGBTQ+ community membership, and disability status, as well as whether they have an arrest or conviction record (“demographic data”). This Indeed demographic data survey is separate from any voluntary self-identification questions provided by Employers. By using the Program, you agree that Indeed may collect demographic data from Job Seekers applying to your Job Listing using Indeed’s demographic survey, and that Indeed may use information from that survey to evaluate and improve our products. You further agree that you as an Employer have no ability, right, or entitlement to view or access demographic data collected via the Indeed demographic data survey pertaining to any Job Seeker or related to any employer by any means including civil discovery, subpoena, or any other legal process without their permission. You agree you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable nondiscrimination laws. Indeed disclaims any warranty regarding the demographic composition of Job Seekers applying to any particular job.
When you use Indeed Apply for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may add functions into the corresponding Indeed Apply emails. In addition, Indeed may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview. Indeed may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume. When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction. If you choose such option, such candidates will receive rejection notices and will be set to rejected in your candidate dashboard. You further acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately. When you use Indeed’s candidate management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to candidates whose status you set to “rejected.” If you choose such option, you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices.
Similarly, you may be given the option to use candidate management tools that schedule interviews on your behalf with Job Seekers who meet criteria you have selected. If you choose such option, Job Seekers will be scheduled for interviews and invited to interviews on your behalf via email based on whether information the Job Seeker has provided to Indeed (e.g., answers to screener questions, resume) matches criteria you have set.
You are responsible for ensuring that your selection criteria are job-related, that you do not pose “disability-related inquiries” or medical inquiries in violation of the law, and that you do not screen out people with disabilities or members of any protected category under the law. You are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law.
You further agree that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these interview invitations (which are purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the information the Job Seeker provided to Indeed may not be accurate. Indeed may request that Job Seekers confirm their interest in the position before scheduling an interview. It is ultimately the Employer’s responsibility to confirm whether any interviews were scheduled, or to reschedule or cancel interviews if necessary. The decision of who to interview is decided solely by the Employer, who can choose to interview any Job Seeker at any time, and by scheduling such interviews, Indeed does not warrant that a Job Seeker is qualified, meets the criteria the Employer has set, or that the information provided by the Job Seeker to Indeed is accurate. Indeed candidate management tools are intended to allow Employers to more efficiently connect with Job Seekers as they determine, and the sole responsibility for the content of any screener question, any decision to proceed or not proceed with interview or offers, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of candidate management tools is solely with the Employer. By using this and other candidate management tools, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers, and that Indeed does not act as your employment agency by offering these candidate management tools.
Indeed may highlight to Job Seekers qualifications required for your position in order to help the Job Seekers assess whether to apply for your role. Indeed does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Indeed know a Job Seeker’s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker’s qualifications or interest in your job listing. You agree that Indeed Apply and Indeed’s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are your and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.
By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions. You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed. You also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions. This includes Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Indeed’s Privacy Policy, as well as Indeed providing the recording to third parties to aid in analysis or quality of the product. Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such phone screens and responses, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Company Page created or claimed by you, or any Job Listing, application materials, voluntary self-identification questions, or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you. Indeed may make Job Ad analytics data available on a Company Page or elsewhere on the Site, and may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Indeed’s discretion. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product as set out in the IO for that product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance. Indeed may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per the maximum interest permitted by law and (ii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting such late payments.
When you view, send, take action on, make a decision regarding, store, or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, applications, pre-recorded interviews, and messages) through or using the Site or any Applicant Tracking System (“ATS”), Indeed may, for any purpose, use any data of such materials or action for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other Job Listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise. Indeed may also inform the Job Seeker of your  actions or activity related to such materials through or using the Site or any ATS.  For example, Indeed may notify the Job Seeker about your activity or action related to a Job Ad (such as pausing or closing it), or Job Seeker’s application or Resume (for example, that you viewed or responded to it, or that you made a decision with respect to it). Indeed may inform Job Seekers about activities you take on the Site, for example, whether you are online, recently active, or active on the Site. You hereby consent to Indeed informing the Job Seeker about such actions and activities.
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, “Responsive Employer” or “Active Employer” or “Hired on Indeed” or “Verified”. Employers may also request that Indeed add such labels. Indeed, in its sole discretion, may also add explanatory content to Job Ads, which may be AI-Generated Content (as defined below), about an Employer’s likelihood to respond to a particular Job Seeker. Indeed shall determine the method by which such labels, badges, or explanatory content are added or which Employers qualify. The lack of a label, badge, or explanatory content may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies or if the explanatory content would apply. Some of the data may be provided by the Employer and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such data. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label, badge, or explanatory content that is added to Employer names or Job Ads. Indeed reserves the right to change or remove such label, badge, or explanatory content features at any time and in Indeed’s sole discretion.
If you access or use any Indeed Application Programming Interface (API), including accessing and using the Site or any of the Indeed Apps or any Applicant Tracking System (ATS) through an API, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, the
Indeed API Terms
,
Indeed Privacy Policy
, the Site Rules, and any additional rules and policies made available by Indeed. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE ANY API AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF ANY INDEED API.
It is your responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App or the Site for the most up-to-date information (including, but not limited to, explanations about how features work, disclaimers and disclosures regarding the services provided, method for charging) about Indeed’s products and services. By using an API, rather than directly using the Site or an Indeed App, you agree to all information provided on the Site or an Indeed App. Use of an Application or ATS via an API, rather than direct use of the Site or an Indeed App, shall not excuse any lack of information or understanding about Indeed’s products and services where that information is otherwise provided on the Site or an Indeed App.
Your use of a third party developer to build an integration with an ATS:
Should you appoint or otherwise utilize a third party developer to develop an integration with an ATS , you shall ensure that you and the third party developer comply with all applicable Data Protection laws (including, inter alia, the execution of data processing agreements) in the development of the ATS integration. When you use the Indeed API through a third party developer to develop an integration with an ATS you shall be fully liable for the actions / omissions of the third party developer and the ATS you choose to use. You shall also ensure that all personal data (including disposition data) transferred to Indeed via the integration takes place in compliance with applicable Data Protection laws, for example, obtaining consents from and providing notices to data subjects (as applicable) as well as implementing relevant agreements where required by such laws. You shall indemnify and hold harmless Indeed against any claim or actions brought by a data subject arising from or related to Your use of the API and/or your use of a third party developer and their use of the API.
You acknowledge that as part of its efforts to combat fraud and spam, Indeed may require that users verify their email address, including Job Seekers applying to your job. However, email verification is not guaranteed. You are responsible for your use of any software that rejects applications from unverified email addresses.
Indeed may offer functionality permitting you to request demographic information, including disability status, from applicants to your Job Ad. If you use such functionality, you represent that you are a federal contractor or subcontractor who is required to seek disability status information from job applicants for the purpose of complying with the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“OFCCP”) requirements. You acknowledge that this functionality is presented without warranty, and compliance with any OFCCP or other governmental record-keeping requirements remains your sole responsibility.
3. Job Match
Job matches are recommendations which may be presented to both you as an Employer and to Job Seekers in various formats on the Site. For example, Indeed may recommend Resumes which match Job Ads you have posted, or recommend Job Ads to Job Seekers which are similar to jobs to which they have recently applied. Job matching is provided to you on a beta basis and is subject to our Beta Program (see section 9 of the Terms of Service for All Users).
To generate matches, Indeed uses data collected through our Site from both Employers and Job Seekers. This includes Job Ads, Resume, application materials (including responses to screener questions), and user activity on the Site (such as searches run and Job Ads clicked on and applied to). Indeed may use this information to present potential matches to you and to potential Job Seekers. Indeed’s matches uses the ESCO classification of the European Commission.
4. Salary, Applies or Other Information Provided by Indeed
Indeed may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only. For example, Indeed may provide Job Seekers with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, number of applies to a Job Listing, responses to certain screener questions for a Job listing, or provide you with estimated applies to your Job Listing. All such figures provided by Indeed are estimates given for informational purposes only, may come from AI-Generated Content or a third party, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy. If you are participating in the Indeed Ads Program and your Sponsored Job advertising budget is set on a per-apply basis, you will be charged based on Indeed’s determination of Apply count as reflected in your employer dashboard and not based on the number of applies that may be provided to Job Seekers for informational purposes only. Indeed may add labels or badges to Job Ads – such as pay types, specialties, benefits, or union associations – based on data contained within the job description. These are for informational purposes only and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge. Indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site.
Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates. These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only. Indeed may also provide data regarding impressions in relation to your Job Ad. Such figures are provided for informational purposes only, are subject to change at any time, and Indeed does not guarantee their accuracy. Indeed reserves the right to change the method of measuring such figures at any time.
Indeed may offer job post templates for informational purposes only. By using any of this content, you adopt it as your own and are responsible for making it true, appropriate and compliant with all applicable laws. All content provided by Indeed, including template job post information and estimated applications for a given job posting, is for informational purposes only, may comprise or be based on information provided by third parties, is provided without warranty, and is subject to change and varying levels of accuracy. Estimated applications are not a guarantee of future performance.
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Job Seeker profiles, such as “Responsive Candidate” or “New Applicant.”  Indeed determines the method by which such labels or badges are added or which Job Seekers qualify based solely on Job Seeker activity on Indeed. The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if a Job Seeker qualifies. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge, and reserves the right to change or remove such label or badge features at any time and in Indeed’s sole discretion.
5. Screening Tools
Indeed may make available to you screening tools for your use for candidates who apply to your job, including screener questions, and phone screen tools. Indeed is licensing these tools to you for your use as you determine. By using any screening product, made available to you by Indeed, you agree that you have made the determination to use these tools as part of your application process, and the substantive questions you ask or choose are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed. You agree you are solely responsible for the use of such screening tools in compliance with the law, such as: the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state statutes; applicable employment, equality or anti-discrimination laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other similar federal, state, and local laws; and any applicable data protection or privacy laws, or laws regulating use of “automated employment decision tools”.
You are responsible for ensuring that your selection criteria are job-related, that you do not pose “disability-related inquiries” or medical inquiries in violation of the law, and that you do not screen out people with disabilities or members of any protected category under the law. You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law. You are responsible for clearly indicating that reasonable accommodations are available, engaging with and responding to any requests for accommodation, and providing information about how to request an accommodation to Job Seekers
. Indeed shall direct Job Seekers who reach out to Indeed with an accommodation request to you via the contact information you provided to Indeed, and you are responsible for monitoring your inbox for such requests.While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, each disability is unique and Indeed does not warrant compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law. You agree to indemnify Indeed for any and all claims arising out of your use of a screening tool, including any claims that any screening tool does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar law, or that your use of any screening tool results in a “disparate impact.”
Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist. Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application. To prevent a rejection notice from being sent, you must indicate your interest in the application on the Site. Any interactions you have directly with a Job Seeker and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing a Job Seeker directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and will not prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent. If you activate Employer Assist then you must interact with a Job Seeker through a tool provided by Indeed to prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent. If you activate Employer Assist, candidates with whom you do not interact within your chosen time frame will receive rejection notices, and you agree to indemnify Indeed from any claims arising therefrom. You further agree that Indeed may notify Job Seekers about the estimated time frame during which they may expect to hear back from you based on the time frame you choose in Employer Assist.
Indeed may offer functionality that groups candidates based on whether they meet or may meet Employers’ criteria, based on text in their resumes or answers to screener questions, and we offer Employers the ability to automatically schedule calls with applicants who meet their criteria as well. In all cases, Employers can view any applicant at any time, and Indeed makes no decisions about any applicant.
You agree that such functionality does not constitute or contribute to a decision, and is not a substitute for human discretion and review. You agree not to use such functionality as the sole factor, as a factor weighted more than other factors, or to modify or overrule conclusions derived from other factors, in your decision-making or hiring processes.
6. Communication through the Site
You may receive notifications via the app, email, SMS or your Indeed dashboard corresponding with your activity or use or a Job Seeker’s activity on or use of the Site, Indeed Apply, Indeed Messaging, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site. In all cases, such notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them. For example, if you wish to interview a Job Seeker, it is your responsibility to follow up with the Job Seeker separately to ensure they know about the interview, do not rely on notifications through the Site. Further, if you post a Job Listing directly on the Site, applications are sent to your Indeed dashboard; any other notifications you may receive are provided solely as a courtesy to you. For example, you may not receive application email notifications if a Job Seeker has not answered screener questions correctly, although these applications will be sent to your Indeed dashboard.  Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
Indeed may enable Indeed Messaging, as well as text messaging relay, email relay, and/or call relay services through our Site directly or through vendors to help facilitate contact between Employers and Job Seekers about a Job Listing. Indeed may also enable Employers and/or Job Seekers to connect with each other on Indeed Messaging via third-party providers. Job Seekers may be notified of messages you send on Indeed Messaging by multiple mechanisms, including within the app, email, or SMS, depending on the Job Seeker’s choice and our discretion. You understand that communicating through such Indeed Messaging and/or other communication options on or through the Site shall be limited to the purpose of hiring for a Job Listing. Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable Indeed Messaging and/or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify Job Seekers that Indeed Messaging or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer. For example, you may be eligible to enable Indeed Messaging pre-apply to certain Job Listings. To remain eligible for Indeed Messaging pre-apply, you must respond to Job Seeker communication in the amount of time identified on the Site. Indeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Indeed Messaging for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice and for any or no reason. Please note that since messaging relay services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays and other errors on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to send or receive communications, such as text messages, emails or calls.  We also do not guarantee that Indeed’s integrations with these third-party providers or interface will be error-free. Further, we do not guarantee that communications sent to or through Indeed Messaging will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.  In the event a message  being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
Indeed may mask or hide contact information, such as phone numbers and email addresses, and substitute it with an alias. For example, Indeed may mask Job Seeker contact information from resumes or applications. Indeed may also mask your email address or phone number, and Job Seekers may see an alias email address or phone number when they communicate with you. You agree to a Job Seeker contacting you from a masked phone number or email. If you contact a Job Seeker from a masked phone number and you do not leave your contact information, after the masked number expires, the Job Seeker may not be able to contact you by phone unless you have provided your actual contact information to them. Once a Job Seeker has your contact info, you agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the manner in which they may use the info.
When you or a Job Seeker send a message to an Indeed provided alias, Indeed and its vendors will process the message to offer you services, display your message on the Site, and for other purposes as provided in this Agreement. For example, when you send or receive a message to an Indeed alias via email, Indeed will decide how and what to extract on Indeed Messaging. Some messages related to the same conversation may not be grouped together.  Indeed may group messages together as part of a conversation on Indeed Messaging. This is done as a courtesy, and some messages related to the same conversation may not be grouped together. When communicating with a Job Seeker through the Site, the Employer sender’s information and any other conversation participant’s information’ may be displayed in different ways depending on the platform (browser or mobile) and whether the participant has an Indeed account. For example, it may be displayed as their Indeed account user name or company name, “Employer” or “Employee #”, “Guest (added from email)”, or as the email account sender display name of the person sending the message, if available, but you or the Job Seeker may not see all that info in all circumstances.
Indeed’s messaging system is not intended for sending one message to multiple Job Seekers. You agree to not use Indeed’s messaging services to send bulk messages, unless specifically authorized in the Indeed interface.
You agree to not circumvent this limitation through using your email client for this purpose, for example by sending email messages through your email client (e.g. your Gmail or third party email provider) to multiple Indeed aliased email addresses.
You agree that any email that you address to more than one Job Seeker on the To, CC, or BCC line is separated into different emails and conversations by Job Seeker; you will see Job Seeker responses in their own email threads and their own conversations on Indeed Messaging. If a user sends an email to multiple recipients (e.g. by adding additional aliased email addresses to the cc field in a third party email client), this may affect the way messages on the Site are displayed. In this case, it is best to view the email conversation in the third party email client. Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you’re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias.
If you, or anyone on your behalf, , view, store, send or receive communication or materials, (including messages, text messages, chats, emails, interview or other voice recordings or transcripts, and any other information) to, on or through the Site, you agree to the communication or material being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.  To achieve these purposes, we use this data  to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Indeed also uses vendors as an extension of the Site to collect, record, process, analyze, and store communication data.  If you disagree with any part of these terms, do not use the Site.
7. Virtual Communications
Indeed may offer you the option to manage virtual and remote communications with Job Seekers within Indeed products, including but not limited to, Indeed Interview, Indeed Hiring Platform, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”). Services may include giving you access to scheduling, video conferencing, web conferencing, meeting rooms, pre-recorded videos, pre-recorded audios and other collaborative services offered by third-party telecommunications service providers. You understand that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider. Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission of virtual communications. Indeed does not guarantee (1) availability of such services at the time You attempt to initiate them (2) the quality of such services, or (3) the dates or times you’ve arranged with Job Seekers for your Virtual Interview. Further, Indeed does not verify the identities or qualifications of Job Seekers with whom you arrange Virtual Interviews.
You are solely responsible for offering alternative methods of communicating or interviewing for individuals with disabilities, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE OR DATA THAT YOU TRANSMIT WHILE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT, INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, OR YOUR IMAGE OR LIKENESS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, INDEED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OR PROTECTING ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT DURING YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.

YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INDEED DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR AVAILABILITY OR RETENTION OF ANY RECORDINGS OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
Upon your request, Indeed may extend invitations to additional representatives at your company to join Virtual Interviews. You understand and agree that Indeed will extend such invitations on your behalf based on the email addresses you provide for those representatives but Indeed is not responsible for inaccuracies in the contact information you provide. Further, Indeed is not responsible, and you are solely responsible for the conduct or actions of your representatives. You represent that you have the authority to bind your additional representatives to Indeed’s Terms, and by extending invitations to your representatives, you are binding them to Indeed’s Terms.
You understand that Indeed is only providing the option for you to communicate with Job Seekers via services that may be offered by third-party providers. Indeed is not a party to your Virtual Interviews and is not a participant in any arrangements you make with Job Seekers. You are responsible for any requests for accommodations from Job Seekers. For example, if a sign language interpreter is requested, it is your responsibility to provide one if you are legally obligated to.
Recording Virtual Interviews: As an Employer, you may be presented with an option to enable recording of Virtual Interviews. You acknowledge and agree that you will not record, store, or analyze Virtual Interviews without permission from Job Seekers and all participants. By recording a Virtual Interview, you represent and warrant to Indeed that you have secured all necessary consent and will comply with all applicable laws, including state and federal law regarding consent to record interviews and phone calls. By choosing to record Virtual Interviews through the Site, you agree that third-party providers and Indeed can store and access the recording. However, you agree that Indeed is not obligated to store or retain any recording of a Virtual Interview. YOU FURTHER AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD INDEED HARMLESS FROM ANY ALLEGATIONS, CLAIMS, ACTIONS, SUITS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, SETTLEMENTS, JUDGMENTS, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS) THAT ARISE FROM THE RECORDING OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
Virtual Evaluations: You shall only use the recordings and other information obtained through Virtual Evaluations for your internal hiring purposes. You shall not use Virtual Evaluations for any illegal, discriminatory or fraudulent purpose. As part of Virtual Evaluations, you will submit or approve interview questions which Indeed will share with candidates. You agree that the interview questions are part of your application process and determined solely by you. Indeed may provide you with the ability to directly invite candidates to participate in Virtual Evaluations or you may instruct Indeed to automatically invite candidates who meet your selection criteria, for example, all candidates who submit an application through the Site. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of Virtual Evaluations, including how you decide which candidates shall be invited to participate in Virtual Evaluations, who you decide to contact after the Virtual Evaluation has been completed and any employment related decisions that you make. Indeed does not act as your employment agency by offering you the Virtual Evaluations service. A candidate’s Virtual Evaluation video will only be deemed complete and submitted to you when the candidate approves the submission through the Virtual Evaluations tool. Indeed reserves the right to not submit a candidate’s response if a candidate or Employer uses the tool in an abusive manner, which shall be determined in Indeed’s sole discretion. You agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing any candidate submissions through Virtual Evaluations, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements. You acknowledge and agree that the video recordings and transcripts associated with Virtual Evaluations will only be retained for a period of one year from the date that the recording is completed by the Job Seeker (“One Year Period”).  After the relevant One Year Period, the video recording and transcript will be permanently deleted and you will no longer be able to view or access them. You acknowledge that the Virtual Evaluations video recordings contain personal and confidential information, and you confirm that those you’re sharing the Virtual Evaluations video link with have permission to view the recording. The term User Content as defined in these Terms of Service shall include the content of the interview questions, as well as the content of the Virtual Evaluations video recordings, transcripts and any other information that you or a Job Seeker sends through Virtual Evaluations.
8. Company Pages, Enhanced Profiles, Employer Branding Hub
When you post a Job Ad directly on the Site, Indeed and/or Glassdoor may automatically generate for you a Company Page and/or a Glassdoor Profile Page. You understand that Indeed may display publicly available information about your company on the Company Page, in accordance with applicable law. You authorize Indeed to claim such Company Page for you on your behalf, which will be marked as a “Claimed Profile” (or similar wording) and allows you to edit and add information to the Company Page. Company Pages allow User Content (as defined below) to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Company identified on the Company Page. Additionally, Indeed may include all of your Job Ads posted on the Site on your Company Page, including those posted directly on the Site as well as those indexed by Indeed from other sources. You agree that you are solely responsible for any content you edit or put on a Company Page, whether generated by or for you, including photograph(s) or videos you provide, and third-party websites reachable from content you put on a Company Page.
Indeed may offer Indeed Company Pages Premium (“CMPP”) and Glassdoor Enhanced Profile (“EP”) (collectively, “Employer Branding Hub”), which include features accessible only on a subscription basis and may be charged as indicated in an insertion order (“IO”). An IO is a separate agreement between you and Indeed that incorporates these Terms. Access to features accessible only by subscription is limited to one Company Page per subscription. Indeed reserves the right to change or remove Company Page, CMPP, or Employer Branding Hub features at any time, in Indeed’s sole discretion. Employer Branding Hub features may include analytics, insights, or other figures, which Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of, and you are responsible for determining their suitability for your intended use or purpose. Use of EP (including Company Structures) and analytics and review analysis provided by Glassdoor are subject to the

You may continue to be charged for your Company Structures until you either renew your EBH or cancel your Company Structures. Indeed is a reseller of Glassdoor products and services, and all invoice and payment processing for such products and services shall be undertaken by Indeed and subject to Indeed’s
Privacy Policy
.
Please note that Indeed and Glassdoor host User Content submitted by our users. User Content includes salaries, company reviews, interview reviews, company photos, answers to Q&A questions on Company Pages or Employer Branding Hub, and other materials and content provided by users to Indeed and Glassdoor. We moderate User Content using the same standard of review for all employers and do not provide preferential treatment for our customers. You understand and agree that our application of User Content moderation policies, and our decision of whether or not to remove a piece of User Content, is within our sole discretion and cannot form the basis of a violation of this Agreement.
You may cancel your participation in CMPP, EP, or Employer Branding Hub at any time by notifying Indeed. Such cancellation is generally effective at the beginning of the next calendar month; except as otherwise indicated on your IO for any EBH annual subscription that automatically renews, if you have prepaid for an annual subscription then cancellation is effective immediately and Indeed will provide a prorated refund of the unused subscription term, which may include any discounts as applicable. Except as otherwise indicated on your IO, annual subscriptions will not automatically renew, and need to be renewed each year through an IO. If you purchase an EBH annual subscription that automatically renews, you acknowledge and agree that your subscription will automatically renew and Indeed will charge you on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription and such cancellation goes into effect, which may not be until the next billing cycle.

You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate.
Indeed may offer some Employers the opportunity to be displayed more prominently, or in an enhanced way, on the Site (“Featured Employer”). Featured Employer is awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion. The ability to receive a Featured Employer designation, generally, is a function of the number of Ads and amount you spend on eligible Sponsored Job campaigns. The Featured Employer program may be changed or removed by Indeed at any time, at Indeed’s sole discretion and without notice.

This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of the Site or any Indeed product, program, or service.
14. Extended Campaign Tools
Indeed may offer a service to facilitate the coordination of Job Ads within geographically distributed businesses, such as franchises or large companies with many locations, such as Indeed Central or Groups (“Extended Campaign Tools”). You acknowledge and agree that using Extended Campaign Tools involves sharing a franchisee’s account information with the franchisor, or sharing a local office’s account information with the corporate headquarters, as applicable. This information may include items such as the number of your business locations or accounts, information about your Job Ads (content, clicks, impressions, etc.), your contact information, and your spend levels. The franchisor or corporate headquarters may request that Indeed contact its franchisees or local offices, respectively, by providing Indeed with contact information, and may provide the content of Job Ads to Indeed for use in connection with Extended Campaign Tools. By using Extended Campaign Tools, you agree to this information being shared, and you represent and warrant that i) all information you provide to Indeed is accurate, and ii) you have all necessary right and authorization to provide such information to Indeed and to permit Indeed to share it in connection with Extended Campaign Tools. You may request that Indeed grant access and control of your Extended Campaign Tools account to additional users. You understand and agree that by submitting such requests, Indeed will contact the users based on the information you provide (name, email address, and job title) and that Indeed is not responsible for verifying the users prior to completion of such requests.
15. Candidate Import
Indeed may offer a platform that allows you, or someone acting on your behalf or authority (such as a recruitment management service), to upload information about job applicants to Indeed and to interact with these individuals and direct Indeed to interact with these individuals on your behalf (hereafter “Candidate Import”). To the extent that any information you provide or otherwise make available to Indeed through our Candidate Import service includes Client Personal Data (as defined below), you instruct Indeed to process such information on your behalf pursuant to this Agreement and any applicable Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”); Client Personal Data and Indeed as used in this Section shall have the meanings given to them in the Data Processing Addendum in this Agreement. By using Candidate Import, you instruct Indeed to display information about the interactions (including Virtual Interviews which are currently scheduled or were previously conducted) between you or Indeed and the job applicants within their Indeed accounts, and you represent and warrant that you, and any third party who you have authorized to upload Client Personal Data to the platform, have obtained all necessary rights and permissions from, and provided all necessary information and disclosures to, job applicants as required under applicable data protection or other relevant law for you to provide or otherwise make available Client Personal Data to Indeed using Candidate Import, and, without limiting the foregoing, (a) no individual whose Personal Data you provide or otherwise make available to Indeed using Candidate Import has exercised any right or made any request to you that would prevent or otherwise limit your ability to share such individual’s Personal Data with Indeed for processing in connection with this Agreement and (b) all job applicants have consented that their data will be shared with Indeed (in accordance with Indeed’s Terms and Privacy Policy) and that Indeed may contact them over email as part of your hiring process, including asking them to create an account with Indeed. You agree to defend and indemnify Indeed for any breach of the foregoing sentence. You also agree that Indeed is only responsible for such Client Personal Data, in accordance with the DPA, once it is received by Indeed and you are responsible for such Client Personal Data up until such receipt by Indeed and thereafter with respect to your use of such Client Personal Data.
C. Terms of Service for Publishers
The following Indeed Publisher Program Terms (“IPP Terms”) apply to any Publisher that accesses, participates, or uses the Indeed Publisher Program (the “Publisher Program”), that accesses or uses an Application Programming Interface created or maintained by Indeed (“API”) related to publishing jobs (such as Indeed’s Publisher API or Publisher Job Search API), or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these IPP Terms, and set out the terms and conditions applicable to your participation in the Program. Any references to “Indeed” shall mean Indeed, Inc. For purposes of this Section C of the Indeed General Terms of Service, “You” or “Publisher” means any entity identified in an enrollment form,application, or questionnaire response submitted by the same or affiliated persons, and/or any agency or network acting on its (or their) behalf, which shall also be bound by these IPP Terms.
1. Indeed Publisher Program
Indeed’s Publisher Program is offered on a limited basis, in limited quantities, in limited locations, and for a limited time. Indeed shall have absolute discretion as to whether or not it accepts a particular applicant or site for participation in the Publisher Program or any part thereof. Publishers are ineligible to participate if their web properties do not conform with the terms of the
Indeed Affiliate Acceptable Use Policy
(the “AAUP”). To participate as a Publisher in the Publisher Program, all participants must be at least eighteen years of age. Participants represent and warrant that all information submitted to Indeed shall be true, accurate and complete.
Publisher acknowledges that by accessing the Site, any Indeed API, or participating in the Publisher Program, Publisher may come into contact with content (including User Content, as defined below) that it finds harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and Publisher acknowledges that Indeed shall have no liability with respect to such content.
2. Publisher Obligations
Any job search results, JobrollTM, pay-per-click, pay-per-apply, or pay-per-started-apply advertisements, and any Indeed logos or other elements supplied by Indeed for use on Affiliates’ websites or websites co-branded by Indeed and Affiliate (collectively, “Program Elements”) may only appear on URLs that Indeed has reviewed and accepted for participation (“Accepted URLs”). Publisher shall advise Indeed of any changes in the type of content accessible at any such accepted URL. Publisher agrees to comply with the specifications provided by Indeed from time to time to enable proper delivery, display, tracking and reporting of Program Elements.
Publisher shall label each displayed Program Element with the phrase “Jobs by Indeed”, wherein the word “Jobs” shall be hyperlinked to
http://www.indeed.com
or other Indeed website as agreed with Indeed and the word “Indeed” shall be the Indeed Logo Image and shall also be hyperlinked to
http://www.indeed.com
or other Indeed website as agreed by Indeed. We provide the
Indeed Logo Image
online for your convenience.
Publisher accepts and agrees to abide by all terms of the
https://www.indeed.com/legal?co=US#aaup
and
Indeed API Terms
. Publisher is permitted to use Indeed’s Site and its content solely pursuant to the terms of the Publisher Program. Publisher shall comply with the terms of this Agreement including the Site Rules. Publisher agrees that it is solely responsible for (and that Indeed has no responsibility or liability to it or to any third party for) any breach of Publisher’s obligations under these IPP Terms and for any consequences (including any loss or damage which Indeed may suffer) of any such breach.
As Indeed wishes to prohibit automated entities from following any individual links posted by Publisher, all hyperlinks to Indeed’s site should include the use of rel=”nofollow”. This applies to editorially placed links, links generated by Indeed’s API, or other link mechanisms.
Publisher hereby grants Indeed permission to refer to Publisher and its websites in Indeed’s marketing materials, wherever such marketing materials shall appear.
3. Payments to Publisher
PUBLISHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT SHALL NOT RECEIVE ANY MONETARY COMPENSATION, INCLUDING COMMISSION PAYMENTS, FOR ACCESSING, PARTICIPATING, OR USING THE INDEED PUBLISHER PROGRAM.
Publisher agrees that it shall not be compensated for any clicks received or transactions generated by Publisher or any party acting on Publisher’s behalf. In addition, Indeed shall not be obligated to pay for any artificial and/or fraudulent impressions or clicks as determined by Indeed or if Publisher is in breach of these IPP Terms. No dashboard or any other view of any click count shall be considered as contractually binding on the Site.
4. Termination
Indeed may suspend or terminate the Publisher Program at our sole discretion, at any time, with or without notice, and for any or no reason. Either party may terminate these IPP Terms and participation in the Publisher Program at any time for any or no reason with or without notice and without liability. If you wish to terminate agreement to these IPP Terms, you may do so by sending a notice by email to support-at-indeed dot com or other email address specified by Indeed. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including without limitation, confidentiality, warranty disclaimers, indemnifications, and limitations of liability.
Upon termination of a publisher from the Publisher Program, for any reason and by either party, Publisher’s API access shall cease and Publisher shall immediately remove all insertion codes and other Program Elements from all pages of its websites.
5. Confidentiality
Publisher shall not disclose Indeed Confidential Information without Indeed’s prior written consent. “Indeed Confidential Information” includes without limitation: (a) all Indeed software, technology, programming, specifications, materials, guidelines and documentation relating to the Publisher Program; (b) click-through rates or other performance statistics relating to the Publisher Program provided to Publisher by Indeed; and (c) any other information designated in writing by Indeed as “Confidential” or an equivalent designation.
6. Indemnification
Publisher shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, licensors, and partners from any third party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of Publisher’s Program use, Publisher Property, site or Publisher Services, or breach of these IPP Terms.
7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These IPP Terms and any dispute arising out of or in connection with these IPP Terms or related in any way to the Site (“Dispute”) will be governed as to all matters, including, but not limited to the validity, construction and performance of these IPP terms and this Agreement, by and under the laws of the State of Texas without giving effect to conflicts of law principles thereof. Any and all actions, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings related to such Dispute shall be filed only in federal or state courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A.. Each of the parties hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A..
You also hereby waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to your use of the Site, the Publisher Program, or these terms of service, if you are located in the United States.
8. Class Action Waiver
By using the Site or any Program Elements and in return for the services offered by Indeed, Publisher acknowledges that Indeed can only offer Publisher these services under the terms and conditions as presented herein. As partial consideration for Publisher’s use of the Site and the Publisher Program, Publisher agrees not to sue Indeed as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against Indeed regarding Publisher’s use of the Site or the Publisher Program. Additionally, as a Publisher, the use of the Site and the Publisher Program is at no charge and Publisher acknowledges that part of the price it is paying to use this Site and the Publisher Program is its acceptance of these terms of service including this Class Action Waiver. If Publisher does not agree to any part of these terms, Publisher should not continue use of the Site, the Publisher Program, or any Program Elements. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits Publisher’s rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff, including in small claims court, subject to the jurisdiction requirements found in Section 7 above.

For information on Indeed’s compliance with the Digital Services Act, please see Section E Digital Services Act (“DSA”).
1. When You Use Our Site
By using the Site, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed collects, records, processes, analyzes, and stores any and all activities you take on the Site, and any and all interactions and communications you have with, on, or through the Site. This includes: which areas of the Site you visit (including URLs), which content you view, which info you input, whether and where you click, scroll, hover-over, mouseover, or otherwise interact with or communicate with or through the Site, the timing of each activity, and time spent on each activity. For example, when you search for Jobs on the Site, send or open an email to or from Indeed or an Indeed email alias, message another user on the Site, chat with a customer support representative or bot, speak with Indeed personnel, submit an application on the Site, participate in an interview on the Site, or otherwise engage with us or others through the Site, Indeed collects, records, processes, analyzes, and stores your activities, interactions and communications. Indeed collects this data from everyone using the Site, including users of private browsing mode, “incognito mode,” or similar modes. Indeed uses vendors as an extension of the Site to collect, record, process, analyze, and store this data. We use this data for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to offer and improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service. You authorize Indeed to use this data, User Content (defined below to encompass items such as resumes) and AI-Generated Content (defined below) to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models, and no compensation in any form shall be due or payable to you in connection with Indeed’s exercise of its rights granted under this Section.
When you use the site, you are requesting that Indeed send data, text, and images which may be stored in temporary or permanent storage in your device. You may delete this data by clearing third-party cookies from your browser and device. For more information on controlling tracking technology, please visit our
Privacy Policy
. You authorize Indeed to make any connections with wires, lines, cables, or instruments, including with communication systems, that it may decide to make from time to time in connection with operating the Site. You further authorize Indeed to use processes that record or decode dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information. You acknowledge that the foregoing is necessary to the operation of the Site.
Occasionally, Indeed tests improvements and updates to our Site and services (including for fraud and bot control), which may affect various aspects of the Site such as job applications (including delivery of test applications), the ad delivery system, audience, ad performance, ad placement, profiles, resumes, resume search, job search, recommendations, alerts, or formatting. You agree that Indeed may conduct such tests without notice to you. Indeed’s services and their availability may differ by location, and you should check the Site in your location to see which services are available to you.
Indeed may offer suggestions, recommendations, or information to users that may support or improve their experience on the Site. These offerings are provided as a courtesy and without warranty, and are based on information provided by other users, and your use of such information is at your own risk. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any decisions you make, or actions you take, using information obtained through the Site.
2. User Content
Some parts of the Site, or our APIs, allow users to post content or data such as Job Ads, resumes, reviews, information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials. This functionality helps users find information and communicate about potential jobs, schools and certifications, employers, and candidates. Any data that a user or other party submits, posts, publishes, displays, or makes available on or through the Site, or otherwise provides to Indeed, is called “User Content.” User Content includes Job Ads, Resumes, reviews, school reviews, certification or license reviews, and messages sent through the Site.
Indeed is not responsible for User Content, which may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or deceptive. Indeed does not know whether User Content is true. Any opinion, fact, advice, information, or statement in User Content is the sole responsibility of its original author, who may use anonymous identifiers. You may come into contact with content that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent, or objectionable. User Content may not be reliable or suitable for use in a legal proceeding. You acknowledge that Indeed has no obligation or liability with regard to publishing, monitoring, or removing User Content. Indeed also has no obligation or liability regarding the accuracy of User Content which may be translated on our site through a Google Translate API.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy including the translation of any user generated content which is translated using Google Translate API, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Company Page.
Content Moderation:
If you provide User Content, it must comply with the Site Rules (below),
Indeed’s policies
, and Indeed’s Terms of Service. These rules, policies, and terms include but are not limited to the following: Your User Content must not be unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, irrelevant, or unconstructive. Your User Content must not contain sexual, ethnic, or racial or other discriminating slurs. Your User Content must not contain proprietary information, trade secrets, intellectual property of another person, or confidential information. Your User Content must not contain spam, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or any other commercial communication besides Job Ads under this Agreement. Your User Content must not be harmful to anyone, especially minors.
In order to be eligible for visibility on the site, job postings must offer open jobs (not training opportunities, expired positions, etc.), provide a detailed and accurate description of the role and be free of vulgar or illicit content, in addition to meeting other criteria outlined
here
.
You may not post official identification information, such as a social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier, or any background check information. Posting such identification information on the internet may lead to identity theft for which Indeed cannot be responsible. You may not post highly confidential personal information, such as medical or health information, or other categories of personal data subject to data breach notification requirements in any country.
By submitting a review or otherwise providing information, ratings, or answers to questions about your former or current employer, you agree that such User Content may be shown publicly on or through the Site and may include your job title, job location, whether you are a current or former employee, and the date on which you provided the User Content. You agree that Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for such User Content, including for any content that you include that may personally identify you. If you do not want your User Content to be publicly visible through the Site or to personally identify you, do not provide such User Content.
Indeed may monitor and screen User Content and may use it to prevent potentially illegal or tortious activities, or any other activities that are detrimental to other users. In some cases, if we determine that your User Content or actions have violated our Terms or any Indeed policy or are detrimental to other users, we may place restrictions on other accounts that we suspect are affiliated or associated with you. If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please
contact Indeed
. However, detection methods are not perfect and false positives or false negatives may occur. Indeed has no obligation to monitor any particular user or User Content, and Indeed makes no guarantee that any particular User Content will be removed. You agree that any reporting feature or moderation functionality that Indeed may implement or make available, in its sole discretion, is not a commercially available product. You also agree that any reporting feature Indeed may make available is not a first response hotline and Indeed has no obligation to remove any User Content reported to Indeed.
Indeed reserves the right to disclose all User Content, and any other relevant information and circumstances, to any third party in connection with operating the Site; to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. This means, for example, that Indeed may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to disclose User Content you have provided. Your identity may be discoverable via such legal requests, even if you post confidentially or anonymously.
Indeed is an interactive computer service, has no obligation to host or remove any particular User Content, and may exclude or remove any User Content from any part of the Site or services for any or no reason. Indeed has no obligation to include any User Content in any part of the Site (for example, Job Ads in search results). Whether any User Content violates any Indeed policy, whether to publish or to withdraw from publication any User Content, and whether to exclude any material that any party seeks to post on the Site, will always remain within the sole discretion of Indeed. You agree that Indeed has no liability or obligation to you or anyone else arising from its editorial decisions.

(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
(2) Civil liability
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of-
(A)
any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or
(B)
any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).
3. License to User Content and Feedback
When you provide User Content you grant Indeed a license to use it. Specifically, you grant Indeed a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, (revocable only as described below), fully paid, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple layers of sub-licensees) right and license to make, use, sell, sublicense, reformat, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, prepare derivative works from and otherwise exploit all User Content you post or submit, for the purpose of publishing material on the Indeed website or its publishers or third party sites, maintaining or improving the Indeed website (including without limitation for the purposes of training a model that recommends content to other users), and promoting Indeed and such User Content without restriction. No compensation in any form shall be due or payable to you in connection with Indeed’s exercise of its rights under the license granted under this Section. To the extent any compensation may be due under applicable law as a result of, or in connection with, Indeed’s exercise of these rights, you hereby waive any and all rights to such compensation to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Indeed shall terminate this licensed use within a commercially reasonable term after User Content has been removed from the Indeed website. Indeed reserves the right to refuse to accept, post, display or make available any User Content at its sole discretion.
Furthermore, you grant to Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees a license to use your name, user name, and/or trademarks and logos in connection with (i) any such User Content, (ii) any Indeed marketing materials containing or incorporating such User Content, or (iii) any actions by Indeed to promote or publicize such User Content (e.g. Job Listings), such as the use of keywords in third-party internet search engines. To any extent that such User Content contains your name, likeness, voice or image, you hereby irrevocably waive all legal and equitable rights relating to claims for violation of your rights of publicity (or any similar claims) arising directly or indirectly from Indeed’s exercise of its rights pursuant to the license granted hereunder.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the User Content that you provide, or that you have the right to grant this license, (ii) your User Content, and Indeed’s use of it, will not violate applicable law or the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or other rights of any person, and (iii) use of your User Content will not result in any breach of contract between you and any third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, damages, and any other monies owed to any person by reason of such User Content. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Indeed and its affiliates from any claims resulting from any such User Content. If you wish to request to revoke the license granted by you in this Section for any such User Content, please send a certified letter of request to the postal address listed above with a copy of your passport or national identity card (for identity verification purposes) and request removal of such User Content. Your certified letter of request must include (a) the signature of the applicable rights holder for such User Content or a person authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder; (b) identification of the User Content for which the license is to be revoked, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate and remove such User Content on the Site; (c) your name, address, telephone number, and email address; (d) a statement that you have a good faith belief that you are the rights holder or authorized by the rights holder to revoke the license for the designated User Content; and (e) a statement that the information in the request is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rights holder or are authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder with respect to such User Content.
At your discretion, you may provide feedback or opinions about Indeed or the Site, such as identifying potential errors, improvements, modifications, bug fixes, or enhancements (“Feedback”). Indeed is free to use such Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and free to disclose such Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.  If you provide Feedback to Indeed, you hereby grant to Indeed a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple layers of sublicensees) right and license to make, use, sell, sublicense, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, prepare derivative works from and otherwise exploit all such Feedback for any purpose without restriction. Indeed may disclose any or all Feedback to any third party in any manner, and may sublicense any or all Feedback in any form to any third party without restriction. Accepting any Feedback does not constitute a waiver of any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Indeed, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

The Site links to other sites on the internet which are owned and operated by third parties (“External Sites”), for example Employer websites, Applicant Tracking Systems, or promotional websites. Links to External Sites may be found in User Content available through the Site (for example, Resumes or Job Ads). Indeed is not responsible or liable for any External Site, including availability or content. Links to External Sites may be removed at any time. Any concerns regarding an External Site should be directed to the responsible third party.
Indeed has no control over what happens on External Sites. If you visit an External Site and complete a transaction outside Indeed, you are entering into an agreement with a third party, alone and at your own risk. You are giving the third party your data directly, and your rights and their obligations are determined by its privacy policies and terms of service. Indeed disclaims all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize or transact with such third parties. We are additionally not responsible for any payment that may be asked of you by such third party.
Indeed may provide you with access to a link on Indeed to services or products offered and performed by a third party (“Third-Party Service”). For example, this service may be offered in the form of permitting a Jobseeker to request their own background check or permitting an Employer to request a background check of a Jobseeker.  Indeed operates solely as a technical conduit, allowing the transmission of background checks sent by a background check Third-Party Service to you. Please note (and you acknowledge) that Indeed cannot and does not assemble, access, view, analyze, manipulate, alter, evaluate or store the background check reports provided by any background check Third-Party Service to you or to any other Indeed user.
If you choose to use the third-party link and its services or products, you are contracting directly with the Third-Party Service, and Indeed is not a party to this contract. Further, you agree to fully indemnify and defend Indeed for any claims arising out of your use of a Third-Party Service’s services or product provided to you by a Third-Party Service.
The Site may include information provided by third-party APIs, which is subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by those third parties. For example, the Site may include Google Maps features and content, which is subject to the current versions of: (1) the
Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service
; and (2) the
Google Privacy Policy
. Company Page data from Japan may come from Toyo Keizai Shinpo Inc.
6. Creating and Accessing Your Account
Some areas of the Site require you to register, provide and verify an email address or phone number, or create an account. You agree to provide information that is true, accurate, current, and complete. You may not create multiple accounts, or create accounts by automated means.
Indeed encourages you to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account where available.
If you do not enable 2FA, you proceed at your own risk. You are responsible for the confidentiality and use of your username and password, which may not be shared. Your account is accessible by anyone with your username and password and who can answer your verification questions. If someone obtains unauthorized access to your account, they could contact users or take other actions through your account, and Indeed’s ability to respond is limited.
If you change your phone number provided for 2FA or verification, the change may not be reflected everywhere on
Indeed.com
, such as the phone number and opt-ins provided through a Job Seeker Profile. An Employer may still be able to contact you at the number in your Profile, if you have opted in to be contacted on that page.
Indeed may send you a notice relating to account security, such as informing you that you may have recently interacted with a compromised account. Indeed cannot and does not guarantee that such notices will always be sent or received, and you therefore agree that Indeed bears no responsibility for doing so. Indeed makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices.
You may be given the option to use a Passkey (such as a face scan or fingerprint) to sign in to your Indeed account. Passkeys are stored locally on your device, and their management are subject to your control. Indeed does not receive any biometric data or other information related to your Passkey.  Indeed is not responsible for any collection, use, storage, processing, or loss of Passkey data nor is it responsible for any legal obligations related to such data. If you do not wish to use Passkey, you may use another method to sign in to your Indeed account.
7. Your Contact Information
As part of the Services, Indeed may contact you through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including with contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party sources.
By providing Indeed with a phone number, you confirm that you are the primary user and subscriber to the telephone number entered, and you expressly agree to receiving calls and texts at that number, including if it is a mobile number.
To stop receiving text messages at any time, reply to the text with STOP or
contact Indeed Customer Support
. DUE TO THE UNSTRUCTURED CONVERSATIONAL FORMAT OF THIS SERVICE, WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OTHER UNSUBSCRIBE ATTEMPTS. Texting STOP in response to an Indeed SMS alert will unsubscribe you from Indeed SMS alerts. However, you may continue to receive texts related to some offerings to which you have subscribed, such as Hiring Events. In order to unsubscribe from these, you must respond STOP within the specific text flows of those offerings. Please note that replying STOP to any text message would unsubscribe you from text messages only, but you may still receive other communications from Indeed.
You may also revoke your consent to receive text messages by terminating the Agreement through closing your Indeed account. Indeed cannot be responsible for third parties to whom you have provided your phone number.
To stop receiving marketing or commercial emails from Indeed, or to manage your email preferences, you may do so by updating your email settings on your Indeed account. You may also opt out of marketing or commercial emails from Indeed by following the unsubscribe link in our messages.
In the United States, Indeed may make publicly available information aggregated from various sources searchable by third parties (like Employers) through the Indeed Resume Search Program or Smart Sourcing. We make that information available on a limited basis and for a limited time to help Employers find and connect with potential job seekers about an Employer’s Job Listings or job opportunities, and such information may not be used for any other purpose. You may remove your publicly available information from the Program and unsubscribe from receiving potential job opportunities from Employers by following the unsubscribe link in our messages. To delete your publicly available information from our Site, submit this

8. Payment
You will be charged as indicated by the Site, as well as any separate Insertion Order or other contract with Indeed.
By providing your credit card, bank account, or other payment method information to Indeed, you authorize Indeed to charge or debit that payment method for fees owed to Indeed for services purchased, pursuant to the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using and any other agreement with Indeed for purchase of services.
By providing your bank account information and signing up for direct debits from Indeed, you authorize Indeed to use ACH to debit the bank account specified for any amount owed for charges arising from your use of Indeed’s services and/or purchase of products from Indeed, pursuant to these terms, until this authorization is revoked.
Advertising
Advertising you purchase may be measured by clicks, RSVPs, applies, impressions, or a subscription or platform fee.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s measurements (such as click count). Indeed’s measurements (such as click count) shall be binding.
Indeed’s measurements may be derived from data from third-party vendors, such as publishers.
Subscriptions
Details regarding the subscription or plan are available on the Site at the time of purchase. If you purchase a subscription plan, you acknowledge and agree that your subscription will automatically renew and Indeed will charge you on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription plan and such cancellation goes into effect, which may not be until the next billing cycle. These charges to your credit card or debits to your bank account will be made to the payment method chosen by you.
Pausing your subscription does not cancel it. Your subscription will continue to automatically renew after being unpaused.
THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED BILLING CYCLES UNDER THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION PLAN. AMOUNTS FOR FUTURE PREPAID UNUSED BILLING CYCLES MAY RESULT IN A PRORATED REFUND OF THE UNUSED BILLING CYCLES, WHICH SHALL BE DETERMINED IN INDEED’S SOLE DISCRETION.
Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.
Billing Policies
Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail, unless otherwise specified by Indeed. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 120 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card or bank account dispute rights).
Any credit card, bank account information, and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, for the purposes of verifying your account, checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed, and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed may obtain updated payment information for credit and debit cards through payment card networks, card issuers or other third party sources. Indeed may use the updated card and bank account information to charge amounts you owe. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. If your Indeed account has a credit card or bank account on file for one Indeed service, we will charge that same payment method for other purchases unless otherwise indicated by you. You may not delete a credit card from your Indeed account if it is the only payment method on file and you have outstanding invoices or charges to your Indeed account.
Change of Address: If you have provided a billing address to us, and you change such billing address from an address within the United States to an address outside the United States, or from an address outside of the United States to an address inside the United States, you will continue to be bound by this Agreement with the same Indeed party for the remainder of the calendar month in which you made the change. Beginning on the first day of the next calendar month, you hereby agree that you will be bound by this Agreement with the applicable Indeed party identified in the first paragraph of this Agreement with respect to such new territory.
If your Indeed account has a credit card or other payment method on file, such as bank account information for ACH payment, Indeed may charge that payment method for any products or services you order, and for any other outstanding payments, including to correct billing errors.
Currency
If you are located in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US dollars. If your billing address is in India, you shall pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you shall pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the
Asia-Pacific Region
*, you shall pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, or US Dollars.
If your billing address is anywhere else, you may be able to pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euros, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, Mexican Pesos, or Japanese Yen. This choice of currencies is subject to Indeed’s approval, which may be withheld in Indeed’s sole discretion.
Taxes
Charges are exclusive of all taxes and VAT.  You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefor. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services.
Regulatory Fees
You may be charged fees to cover the increased operating costs of complying with certain local legislation in certain countries. Fees will be added to your invoice subtotal, included as a line item on invoices, and paid or charged to your payment method in the normal course and in accordance with Indeed’s billing policies and practices.
Refunds
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Indeed may offer refunds for Indeed services for a period of four (4) months from the date of purchase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indeed will not provide refunds in case of abuse of our policies, and any and all refunds are ultimately at the sole discretion of Indeed.
You agree to pay (i) penalties for late payment as per contemporaneous US Federal Reserve interest rates plus 10%, or the maximum interest permitted by law, whichever is lower, and (ii) a statutory lump-sum indemnity for recovery cost, if provided for under applicable laws, and (iii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late payments.
9. Other Services
Indeed Apps.
“Indeed Apps” means our downloadable applications available in device application marketplaces, such as the Indeed Job Search, Indeed Resume Search/Smart Sourcing, Indeed Employer, and Indeed Job Spotter. This Agreement applies to your use of any Indeed App. The legal entity responsible for the Indeed App is the one specified in this Agreement, even if the entity identified as the developer on an application marketplace is Indeed, Inc.
If you allow an Indeed App to use your device’s location service, the Indeed App may collect information based on your device’s geographic location. Some location data is linked to your account (for example, “coarse” location data collected by an iOS app). Other location data the Indeed Apps collect is not linked to your account (for example, “precise” location data collected by an iOS app) but is still used by Indeed.
Apple-Specific Terms.
In addition to your agreement with the foregoing terms and conditions, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the following provisions apply with respect to your use of any mobile application version of the Site compatible with the iOS operating system of Apple Inc. (“Apple”, and such mobile application, the “App”). Apple is not a party to this Agreement and does not own and is not responsible for the App. Apple is not providing any warranty for the App except, if applicable, to refund the purchase price for it. Apple is not responsible for maintenance or other support services for the App and shall not be responsible for any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses with respect to the App, including any third-party product liability claims, claims that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation, and claims with respect to intellectual property infringement. Any inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the App, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to Indeed in accordance with the “Questions or Complaints” section above. The license you have been granted herein is limited to a non-transferable license to use the App on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple’s iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by you, or as otherwise permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Service. In addition, you must comply with the terms of any third-party agreement applicable to you when using the App, such as your wireless data service agreement. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof; notwithstanding the foregoing, Indeed’s right to enter into, rescind or terminate any variation, waiver or settlement under this Agreement is not subject to the consent of any third party.
E-Signature.
The Site may offer e-signature options, which may be powered by a third-party service provider. By using e-signatures on the Site, you agree that your e-signature is intended to authenticate the document you are signing, and your e-signature will have the same force and effect as a manual signature. Indeed is not a legal record keeper. Your use of e-signatures is at your own risk, and it is your responsibility to ensure that your document is received and to retain your own copies.
Beta Program.
Indeed may offer beta products or features on our Site, identified by the word “Beta” or “Test” (“Beta Products”). Beta Products may be offered in limited quantities, in limited locations, and for a limited time. Indeed may discontinue or cancel all or part of a Beta Product at any time without prior notice to you.
ANY BETA PRODUCT IS IN TESTING PHASE AND IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND IS BELIEVED TO CONTAIN DEFECTS. A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF TESTING A BETA PRODUCT IS TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK ON PERFORMANCE. YOU ARE ADVISED TO SAFEGUARD IMPORTANT DATA, TO USE CAUTION, AND NOT RELY IN ANY WAY ON THE CORRECT FUNCTIONING OR PERFORMANCE OF THE BETA PRODUCT.
If you have been invited to test a Beta Product, you agree that, unless otherwise specifically provided herein or agreed by Indeed in writing, any Beta Product constitutes confidential proprietary information of Indeed. You shall permit only authorized users to access the Beta Product. You agree not to transfer, copy, or disclose such confidential information without the prior written consent of Indeed.
AI-Generated Content.
Indeed may make available content created in whole or in part by an algorithm (including “artificial intelligence” and machine learning algorithms), which may be generated in response to information you provide through the Site (“AI-Generated Content”). AI-Generated Content may include chatbots, draft cover letters or resumes, career recommendations, template job descriptions, messages or highlights/summaries. AI-Generated Content is a Beta Product under this Agreement. The use of AI-Generated Content is a rapidly evolving field of study and we are working to improve our use of AI-Generated Content to make it more accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. AI-Generated Content may be generated in whole or in part by third-party service providers such as OpenAI. The AI-Generated Content is owned by or otherwise licensed by Indeed and is subject to Indeed’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You agree that you do not have any intellectual property rights in any AI offering, any models, or AI-Generated Content on the Site. Given the variable nature of this type of content, AI-Generated Content is provided “as is” and Indeed makes no warranty that AI-Generated Content is appropriate, accurate, inoffensive, unbiased, non-infringing, legal, or safe, and disclaims all liability for AI-Generated Content.
Use of AI-Generated Content is entirely at your own risk. AI-Generated Content may not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You must evaluate AI-Generated Content for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including using human review as appropriate, before using or sharing AI-Generated Content generated through the Site. By generating or using AI-Generated Content (for example, by providing content to the Site for the purpose of generating AI-Generated Content, or by adding AI-Generated Content to a job description or resume), you adopt, confirm, and ratify it. You agree that Indeed is not the author of AI-Generated Content, which may be provided by a third party.
You acknowledge and agree that none of Indeed’s AI-Generated Content, such as chatbots, are empowered to enter into, or make any changes to, any agreements on behalf of Indeed and that any decisions or actions taken by such offerings are not legally binding. Further, Indeed may not honor any benefits provided by AI-Generated Content if they are inconsistent with our policy and are not also provided elsewhere on the Site.
You agree not to use AI-Generated Content for adversarial, abusive, or other harmful purposes, including but not limited to misusing outputs to create misleading, illegal, or harmful content or testing the functionality to exploit vulnerabilities. You agree to take full responsibility for the AI-Generated Content and its use or misuse, including any inaccuracies, non-compliance with these Terms or the Site Rules, and any harm caused to you or anyone else. You agree to defend and indemnify Indeed from any claim arising from your generation or use of AI-Generated Content.

15. Claims of Infringement
U.S. Copyright Infringement. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC. § 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, Indeed Tower 200 West 6th Street, Floor 36, Austin, TX 78701, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email). We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

In no event may you frame any portion of the Site or any materials contained therein.

17. Miscellaneous
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Indeed, and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings, and agreements, written or oral. If the Job Seeker Terms, Employer Terms, or Publisher Terms apply to your use of the Site, those terms shall control in the event of an inconsistency or conflict with these Terms of Service for All Users.
Each provision of this Agreement is a separately enforceable provision. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the extent necessary in order for this Agreement to remain in effect.
This Agreement cannot be modified or amended, except by a document signed by an authorized representative of each party. Your use of our Site through an agency or reseller arrangement does not exempt you from these Agreement terms. Written or phone communication between you and an Indeed employee is not a modification or amendment of this Agreement.
Any notices to Indeed must be sent to the applicable Indeed entity identified above via certified first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt. Notice to you may be effected by sending email to the email address specified in your account, or by posting a message to your account interface, and is deemed received when sent (for email) or no more than fifteen (15) days after having been posted (for messages posted to your account interface).
You may not assign or delegate any of your rights or obligations hereunder without Indeed’s prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. Indeed may freely assign or delegate its rights and obligations hereunder without notice to you. Indeed and you are not in a legal partnership, agency relationship, or employment relationship. When Indeed provides the Site or any related services to you, it is solely as an information service provider.
Indeed does not act as an employment agency by providing the Site or its tools. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing, nothing in the terms should be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationships between us and third parties. Any references to such third parties as “partner” does not indicate that such party has any authority to bind us to any agreements or representations on our behalf without our prior written consent.
“Including” means “including without limitation.”
18. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
This Agreement will be governed as to all matters, including, but not limited to the validity, construction and performance of this Agreement, by and under the laws of Texas, United States. The courts located in Austin, Texas, United States, shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any disputes.
Despite the application of Travis County, Texas law, if you are a consumer resident in the EU, you also enjoy the protection of the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you have your habitual residence. The application of mandatory provisions limiting the choice of law and in particular the application of mandatory laws of the country in which you have your habitual residence, such as consumer protection laws, shall remain unaffected.
19. Patent Disclosure
Certain elements of the Site and/or Indeed Apps are licensed pursuant to one or more of the United States patents described
here
.
E. Digital Services Act (“DSA”)
This Section E pertains to Indeed’s operations in the EU only, applies to users located in the EU only, and does not apply to users located elsewhere. In the event of any conflict with any other part of this Agreement, this Section E will control.
1. Recommender Systems
Indeed uses the following information to display Job Ads in recommender systems (as defined under the DSA) and to determine the relevant prominence of Job Ads within such recommender systems: information directly provided to Indeed such as profile information and resume, prior activity on the Site, search terms and/or search location (“Main Parameters”). Prior activity on the Site means actions that you have taken on the Site, for example, previous searches, jobs that you have clicked on, jobs that you have applied to, job alert emails that you have subscribed to and companies/roles in which you have expressed an interest. To modify or influence the search results you see, you can modify your search terms.
The Main Parameters are used by Indeed to target Job Seekers with Job Ads that are most suitable for them, based on information available to Indeed. The appearance of a Job Ad on your job search results page is not a guarantee that the Job Ad is suitable for you. Indeed ranks and orders Job Ads within search results based on a combination of remuneration paid to Indeed by Employers and the Main Parameters.
In the job search results page, the most significant criteria in determining the Job Ads suggested to the Job Seeker is the search terms. We place greatest significance on this parameter in order to surface the Job Ads that are most relevant for the Job Seeker (ie, those that a Job Seeker is most likely to click on or apply to). For all other Job Ad recommendations on the Site, the criteria determining the Job Ads suggested to Job Seekers are equally significant.
In the EU, we return search results in Resume Search/Smart Sourcing based on search terms, Job Ad data, prior activity of Resume Owners on the Site and/or Resume Owner data. Resume Owner data refers to data provided by Resume Owners to Indeed, for example, their current job title and location. Prior activity of Resume Owners means actions that Resume Owners have taken on the Site, for example, jobs that Resume Owners have previously applied to or clicked on. The most significant criteria in determining the information suggested to users is search terms. These parameters are used to try to predict the probability that a Resume Owner will apply to a Job Ad and positively respond to an Employer
2. Commercial Communication
If you would like to declare that your content is or contains commercial communications, as described in the DSA, you can do so
here
. In accordance with the Terms, commercial communications are prohibited on our Site. Identifying your content as commercial communications may result in the removal of your content from our Site.
3. DSA “Advertisements”
All Job Ads are considered advertisements based on the ordinary meaning of that word. However, within the EU, the DSA states that information is an “advertisement” where it is “presented by an online platform on its online interface against remuneration specifically for promoting that information”. Therefore, as Indeed does not receive any monetary remuneration for free Job Ads, they do not constitute “advertisements” within the EU under the DSA. Within the EU, when Indeed receives remuneration specifically for promoting information, we include prominent markings identifying that information as an “advertisement.”
Employers cannot choose the main parameters Indeed uses to determine the recipient to whom a Sponsored Job is presented. Sponsored Jobs are presented to Job Seekers based on the Main Parameters set out above, and the Ad Transparency Information in each Sponsored Job reflects this.
Sponsored Jobs and Employer Branding Ads include “Ad Transparency Information”. Ad Transparency Information is generated and accurate as of the time that a user clicks on a Job Ad. The “Beneficiary” represents the natural or legal person on whose behalf the advertisement is presented. The “Sponsor” denotes the natural or legal person who paid for the advertisement, if that person is different from the Beneficiary. The Beneficiary and Sponsor are based on information available to Indeed and provided by Employers to Indeed. If you are an Employer, you confirm that all information you have provided to Indeed is accurate and complete and you agree to the publication of the employer and company name on the Site, as required by law. Within the EU, Employers shall not post a job with a confidential or generic company name.
4. Identifying and Removing Fraudulent Accounts
Indeed uses automatic and manual means to identify and remove fraudulent accounts from the Site. Indeed implements rules to automatically flag potentially risky accounts for review by its moderators, and proactively uses various tools and subject matter expertise to manually identify accounts that the automatic system may miss.
Users can also proactively identify and report potentially fraudulent accounts and all other user-generated content on the platform, including job posts, company page content, and messages. These reports are reviewed by trained moderators.
5. Moderating User-Generated Content
Indeed also uses automatic and manual means to moderate user-generated content on the site, including implementing rules to automatically flag content that may not meet the standards set out in
Indeed’s policies
and these Terms of Service. Indeed also proactively reviews user-generated content for compliance with its policies and these Terms of Service. Additionally, users can report content they deem problematic
here
. These reports are reviewed by trained moderators.
6. Complaints Procedure
If you are unhappy with a decision taken by Indeed in response to a notice of illegal content submitted by you via the
reporting portal
or a decision taken by Indeed to restrict, remove or disable access to your content;  to suspend or terminate the provision of service to you; or to suspend or terminate your account, you may submit a complaint within six months. The six-month period begins on the day you are informed of the decision you are submitting a complaint about. Indeed requires you to include the following information in your complaint form: your email address, your reference number, and the specific reasons for your complaint, including why you disagree with Indeed’s decision.
7. Misuse
Indeed may disable a user’s account, restrict a user’s ability to use all or parts of the Site, or take other action on a user’s account if the user engages in misuse of the Site. Misuse includes, but is not limited to, submitting unfounded reports of illegal content, submitting unfounded complaints, or posting illegal content. Indeed reviews instances of misuse on a case-by-case basis and considers the facts and circumstances of the misuse, including but not limited to the number of instances of misuse, the frequency of the misuse, and the gravity of the misuse.
Further terms and conditions regarding moderation of User Content are set out in Section 2 of Terms of Service for All Users above.
F. UK Online Safety Act (“OSA”)
This Section F pertains to Indeed’s operations in the United Kingdom only, and does not apply to users located elsewhere. In the event of any conflict with any other part of this Agreement, this Section F will control.
1. The Minimisation of Illegal Content on Indeed
Indeed utilizes a number of internal tools, policies, and highly trained moderators and contractors that work tirelessly to identify and prevent illegal content on the platform. While Indeed’s Trust & Safety Team is dedicated to independently mitigating illegal content on the platform, additional attention is given to illegal harms as defined by the OSA, including, but not limited to: terrorist content; hate content; and child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) content.
2. Reports of Illegal Content and Resolution of Complaints
Users are able to report content that they may believe to be illegal or against Indeed’s policies. Each instance of user-generated content, such as a job advertisement or company review, contains an option for users to file a report for that specific piece of content. Through this feature, users are able to provide information on whether they believe the content is in violation of Indeed’s policies. Content that users believe to be illegal as defined under the OSA can be submitted via a report using
this form
on the
Online Safety Page
. Each report submitted via this form will be reviewed and actioned, if necessary, within 24 hours.
Indeed’s UK Trusted Flagger Policy allows for designated UK authorities or entities to submit a report of illegal content to Indeed through a dedicated communication channel. All complaints or reports submitted via this channel are reviewed and responded to within 48 business hours.
3. Proactive Technology for Illegal Content Detection
Indeed also uses automatic and manual means to moderate user-generated content on the site, including implementing rules to automatically flag content that may not meet the standards set out in
Indeed’s policies
and these Terms of Service. Indeed also proactively reviews user-generated content for compliance with its policies and these Terms of Service. Additionally, users can report content they deem problematic
here
. These reports are reviewed by trained moderators.
Indeed Products Terms of Service
Last Updated: March 19, 2025
Indeed Ads Program Terms
You use the Ads Program when you advertise with Indeed by posting, providing, submitting, using, editing, claiming, or paying for any advertisement (“Ad”) for publication on or through the Site. Ads may be posted directly via the Site, or via campaigns, XML feeds, APIs, ATS integrations, requests to index Ads from elsewhere, or by otherwise identifying an Ad or making it available to Indeed. By posting Ads and using the Ads Program, you agree to the
Indeed Terms of Service
(the “Agreement”), including these Indeed Ads Program Terms (“IAP Terms”).
Indeed may update the Ads Program or these IAP Terms at any time without liability, and your use of the Ads Program after notice that these IAP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IAP Terms.
1. Ad Publishing
Ads may promote job listings of open employment positions (“Jobs” or “Job Ads”), hiring events or job fairs, both online or in-person (“Indeed Hiring Events”), or an Employer’s workplace generally (“Employer Branding Ads”). Ads are User Content under the Agreement, and you are granting Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees a license to use your Ads and associated data, and to display, publish, reformat, display a snippet or portion of, and host (but not change the content of) your Ads in any way Indeed or its affiliates or sublicensees see fit, including due to technical limitations. (Employers located in Japan: you agree that content moderation may result in the modification of your Job Ad.)
Ads may appear on any page, site, content, service, device, screen, app, or property chosen by Indeed in its sole discretion, whether provided by Indeed as part of the Site or Indeed Apps, or provided by a third party (“Other Sites”). Indeed has limited control over Other Sites, including their nature, content, appearance, and Ad display, and you accept any related risks of publication. Other Sites may collect or receive performance information about your Ad.
Target audience membership is based partly on information and criteria provided by the Employer, for example information provided in the Ad, but the composition of each target audience on the Site, and the frequency of publication to that audience, are determined by Indeed in its sole discretion. Indeed may have limited or no control over the display of Ads on Other Sites, including their audiences.
From time to time Indeed may add labels (such as “Urgent”, “Urgently Hiring”, “Ad”, “Paid”, “Promoted”, or “Sponsored”) when publishing an Ad. Indeed reserves the right to add, change, or remove labels at any time. When you enable labels like “Urgent” or “Urgently Hiring” for your Ad, the frequency of showing such a label on your Ad is determined by Indeed in its sole discretion. Indeed may display an estimate of the compensation associated with any Job Ad. If you do not want an estimate to be shown, you must provide Indeed with the actual compensation.
Indeed does not guarantee reach, performance, placement, or distribution of Ads, all of which may vary depending on Indeed’s consideration of various factors, such as supply and demand, industry, type of role, and sponsorship. The distribution, placement, positioning, size, and location of Ads are determined by Indeed in its sole discretion.
You agree that Indeed has no obligation to accept, host, or publish your Ad.
That decision is entirely Indeed’s in its sole discretion.
Indeed may reject or remove any Ad for any or no reason without notice.
Indeed may also pause Ad campaigns without notice. For examples of why Job Ads from Employers may be rejected, refer to
Indeed Job Posting Standards
.
Indeed further reserves the right to include or reject any or all Job Ads from a job board. Generally, job boards may only post Job Ads on their own behalf as an Employer. A job board may only post Job Ads on its clients’ behalf if they conform to the
Job Board Inclusion Guidelines
, which also give examples of why Job Ads from job boards may be rejected. Attempts to violate the Guidelines may result in limiting or disabling your account. The determination as to whether you are a job board is made by Indeed in its sole discretion, and such decision is binding. Indeed further reserves the right to reject any Job Ads which advertise staffing opportunities or platforms rather than jobs.
You acknowledge that inclusion of Ads that violate these IAP Terms or Indeed policies or standards may harm Indeed and its users. Although Indeed may indicate why an Ad has been removed, we cannot give every reason why, and we always retain the right to remove any Ad if we feel it is in the interest of users or Indeed. The Indeed team responsible for maintaining the quality of the Site is independent, and its decisions are final and not subject to review.
To post a Job Ad at no additional cost, post it through the Site without setting a budget, or otherwise decline the option to sponsor. When you post a free Ad, that Ad will be visible on the Site for a limited time and may automatically pause once the time or application limit is reached. As described below, please note that Indeed may require an Ad to be sponsored, or limit the number of free Ads you are allowed to post, for any or no reason in Indeed’s sole discretion, including to benefit Job Seekers, to verify the legitimacy of the Ad or the Employer, to prevent abuse of the free to post system, or to improve the Site.
Performance, cost, budget, and other data related to your unclaimed indexed Job Ad on the Site is available to anyone who claims the Job Ad or feed. It is your responsibility to claim your Job Ads and feeds, and to alert Indeed in case of an inaccuracy.
Employer Branding Ads
, formerly known as
Indeed Targeted Ads.
Employer Branding Ads may be sponsored (generally Pay Per Impression), and Indeed may in its sole discretion include Employer Branding Ads at no additional cost when you sponsor a Job Ad. Employer Branding Ads are also provided on the Glassdoor platform, and subject to the
Glassdoor Terms of Use
, except that these IAP Terms will govern in the event of a conflict. By using Employer Branding Ads, you agree to the
Glassdoor Terms of Use
.
Indeed Hiring Events.
When you post an Indeed Hiring Event, you are asking Indeed to manage the Ad campaign, distributing its budget among our different pricing models in our sole discretion. You will be charged in accordance with the selected pricing model(s) and any applicable subscription fee. Posting an Indeed Hiring Event may require a minimum advertising budget. You are also asking Indeed to send emails or text messages related to your event to users who RSVP to your event, such as in case of event cancellation, though delivery is not guaranteed.
You are solely responsible for all aspects of your hiring event, whether participating or hosting, including your Ad and hiring process, the event’s timing, location, accessibility, security, and attendance, signage, documentation, reviewing Job Seeker qualifications, verifying information, screening applicants, and responding to requests for accommodation.
Tracking Pixels.
Indeed may permit you to include tracking pixels in Ads. This functionality is provided solely as a courtesy, and Indeed may disable any tracking pixel at any time. Indeed provides no warranty regarding the proper functioning of a pixel, any numbers reported, or that use of a pixel would be error-free. You are advised not to rely on the pixel. Tracking pixels are for convenience only, and may not be used to profile users, for behavioral analytics, or to dispute Indeed’s advertising charges. You are solely responsible for your tracking pixels, and Indeed disclaims all liability related to such use. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, including applicable privacy and data protection laws, and to defend and indemnify Indeed from any claim arising from your use of tracking pixels.
Integrations
.
Indeed may support or offer functionality by which an Employer may monitor progress through parts of their hiring process, such as a conversion tracker or ATS integration (“Integrations”). Integrations send data to Indeed about applications originating on the Site, including completion of an application, contacts, interviews, and hiring decisions. This data is User Content under the Agreement.  Integrations involving Indeed’s Sponsored Jobs API may also allow Employers to automate the sponsorship of Job Ads. By accessing or using the Sponsored Jobs API, you or your End User may incur a charge whenever your or your End User’s monthly spend to sponsor Job Ads via monthly campaign(s) is less than the calculated total monthly cost of using the API as determined by Indeed and indicated on the Site, in the Documentation (including in the Indeed Developer Portal), or as otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. Spend on Job Ads sponsored with daily budgets is not considered when determining if you or your End User will incur a charge. Charges are solely based on Indeed’s measurements, and Indeed’s measurements shall be binding. Any connections to an Indeed API are subject to the
Indeed API Terms
in the Agreement.
Integrations are provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and without warranty. Indeed disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Integrations. Your installation and use of an Integration must be in accordance with all applicable laws, including providing any necessary disclosures and obtaining any necessary consent or agreement.
2. Ad Sponsorship
An Ad can be sponsored using tools on the Site or an integration with Indeed such as your ATS, or through a campaign, including Sponsored Jobs. “Sponsor” means you are paying Indeed to advertise and publish the Ad, and you are requesting that Indeed manage your Ad campaign using automated tools for Ad placement and bid optimization, for exposure and visibility on the Site and Other Sites. This management is in Indeed’s sole discretion and is provided without warranty as to placement or visibility of any Ad.
Sponsorship is not a guarantee that the Ad will be published at any particular time or place, or displayed more prominently or frequently than other Ads.
Sponsorship means Indeed exercising its judgment and discretion in publishing the Ad, to achieve what Indeed determines is the most appropriate visibility for the Ad and budget.
The price to sponsor an Ad is measured by user activity, such as impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPS, or Started Applications. You are not buying these clicks or other actions themselves; they are only different ways to measure the advertising service Indeed provides.
Indeed may require a minimum Ad budget to sponsor a Job Ad or to post an Indeed Hiring Event. A campaign to sponsor multiple Job Ads may also require a minimum spend per Job Ad.
Prices vary based on many factors, including supply and demand of Ads, impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPs, Started Applications, Applications, internet traffic, time of day or year, job title, and job location.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s measurements of user activity, including impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPs or Started Applications. Indeed’s measurements of such activity shall be binding.
Indeed’s measurements may include and rely on data from third parties, including vendors and Other Sites, over which Indeed has limited control or knowledge.
You agree that Indeed has no obligation to accept, host, or publish your Ad.
That decision is entirely Indeed’s in its sole discretion, regardless of sponsorship.
Indeed may reject or remove any Ad for any or no reason without notice.
Once removed, an Ad does not receive impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPs, Started Applications, or Applications.
Indeed may require an Ad to be sponsored, for any or no reason in Indeed’s sole discretion, including to benefit Job Seekers, to verify the legitimacy of the Ad or the Employer, to prevent abuse of the free to post system, or to improve the Site. For example, sponsorship may be required for identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs (including similar jobs) re-posted after an initial time period, jobs that have reached the free application or Ad time limit on the Site, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission-only, or hard-to-fill jobs. Except for in Japan, sponsorship is required for any Job Ad that you post directly on the Site if any of your jobs already get organic visibility through being aggregated or indexed to the Site from sources such as a data feed (e.g. XML, API), your career site, your company site, or ATS. Except for in Japan, Ad sponsorship is required for jobs posted by a staffing agency, recruitment process outsourcer, or other recruitment-based company.
You may have the option to sponsor an Ad at a premium budget specified on the Site for access to certain features as specified on the Site.
You are solely responsible for reviewing and selecting appropriate features for your Ad and for all optional targeting features you choose
, including targeting that allows your Ad to appear in the approximate geographic locations that you select and to an audience based on relevant job criteria that you select. Certain optional targeting features are based on user provided information, and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such information. You are not required to use any optional features, and as applicable, may opt-in to or opt-out of usage of those features. Unless otherwise stated on the Site, your Ad budget will not change by opting out of any optional features.
3. Budget and Pricing Models
Ad campaigns can be sponsored under different pricing models, described below. Each sponsored Ad will incur a charge upon the associated user action, until its budget is depleted or you pause or close the Ad. For example, one Job Ad campaign may be charged per click, while another campaign may be charged per Started Application. This activity may happen on the Site, Indeed Apps, or Other Sites.
Pricing is indicated on the Site or an Insertion Order. When you start, edit, or change a sponsored Job Ad campaign or plan, the pricing models available to you may vary. Indeed reserves the right to offer different pricing models at different times in different circumstances, in limited quantities, in limited locations, and for a limited time, or to set any pricing model as default. Prices and pricing models may vary between different Ads, or between the same Ad posted at different times or locations (such as when a campaign is closed and later reopened). If you do not select a pricing model for a sponsored Ad campaign, Indeed may select one.
It is your responsibility to monitor your Ad campaigns, select the appropriate pricing model and budget for each campaign, and manage their budgets.
You can pause, unpause, or close your Ads at any time.
You can also change your Ad budget at any time. When you change your Ad budget, your access to sponsored job features may change accordingly. For example, by decreasing your Ad budget below the premium budget specified on the Site, you will lose access to certain features that are only available by maintaining the specified budget. A budget or spending limit you set for one Ad campaign is for that type of campaign only, and does not limit how much you will spend on other campaigns or other services. For example, the budget and limits for Pay Per Started Application campaigns will not apply to a Pay Per Click campaign.
If your written Insertion Order does not contain an end date, your campaign will run, and you will continue to be billed, until you contact Indeed to cancel.
Indeed may provide budget recommendations and performance estimates for a given budget (such as expected visibility or clicks), or other predictions related to your Ad. This data is provided “as is,” without warranty, and does not guarantee performance or visibility, or interaction with your Ad or job.
Pricing Models
Pay Per Impression.
You will be charged based on impression count. An impression generally occurs when your Ad appears on a page or screen which has been presented to a user. Delivery of an impression does not guarantee any level of viewership of your Ad or interaction with your job. Impression data may rely on third parties like Other Sites, who may measure impressions differently from each other.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s impression measurements. Indeed’s impression count shall be binding.
Pay Per Click
, also known as
Daily Budget.
You will be charged based on click count. Clicks can be on Ads or on other content such as messages and notifications. Your dashboard will reflect the total click count.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s click count. Indeed’s click count shall be binding.
Pay Per Started RSVP.
You will be charged when a user takes the first step to RSVP to your Hiring Event (a “Started RSVP”), including clicking on a button or link to start or continue an RSVP. A Started RSVP is considered complete even if the user does not proceed further, and does not guarantee they will complete an RSVP or attend a Hiring Event.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s Started RSVP measurements. Indeed’s Started RSVP count shall be binding.
Pay Per RSVP.
You will be charged for each RSVP to your Hiring Event. An RSVP is defined as a user completing the online RSVP form agreeing to attend your Event. An RSVP does not guarantee that a Job Seeker will attend your Event.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s RSVP measurements. Indeed’s RSVP count shall be binding.
Pay Per Started Application.
You will be charged when a user takes the first step of applying to your job (a “Started Application”). A Started Application includes: 1) a click on a button or link to start or continue an application; 2) interacting with a chatbot, QR code, or other method to start or continue an application; 3) a click on a button or link to schedule an interview; and 4) a click on a Sponsored Job ad on a third party website, which leads to the Indeed Apply page. A Started Application is considered complete even if the user does not proceed further, and does not guarantee they will complete an application.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s Started Application measurements. Indeed’s Started Application count shall be binding.
4. Billing and Payment
Indeed may charge the credit card, or bank account information on file for your account. You will be charged upon the earlier of (a) your Ad campaign spending $500.00 or more or (b) the beginning of the next calendar month after you sponsor your Ad. If you previously sponsored Pay Per Click Ads on the same account, you may also be charged once your Job Ad campaign spends $25.00. For an Ad campaign, or the purchase of products or services of more than $500 per month, you may be charged multiple times a month. If you do not provide a payment method for a Sponsored Job campaign, the campaign will not begin and your Ad will not be visible, though Indeed may in its sole discretion remove the budget and post the Ad with organic visibility.
Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail. Your payment must be in accordance with the Payment section in the Terms for All Users section of the Agreement. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 120 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). You are responsible for paying all expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. Refunds (if any) are in accordance with the Refunds section in the Terms for All Users section of the Agreement. If you are removed from the Site, but have previously spent on the Site, you are not entitled to a refund of previously spent amounts.
Charges are exclusive of all taxes, including VAT. You are responsible for all taxes and government charges as applicable and appropriate. All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefor. (If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed services.)
Your credit card, bank account, and related billing and payment information may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors or credit agencies, for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed, and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information.
5. Conditions and Prohibited Uses
Your use of the Ads Program is permitted on the condition that you adhere to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including these IAP Terms, the Agreement, the Site Rules, Privacy Policy, and instructions on the Site and Indeed Apps. Violation may result in restrictions on your account, termination of your account and the Agreement, and legal penalties and consequences. Indeed terms and policies may be modified at any time.
You are responsible for all information you provide or request that Indeed publish, whether through the Site or otherwise, and whether generated by or for you, in any medium, including text, image, mark, logo, video, or audio, all which is considered User Content under the Agreement. Indeed relies on the accuracy of the information you provide. You must notify Indeed immediately if you notice any inaccuracy.
You accept sole responsibility for: (a) User Content provided by, attributable to, or associated with you, including Ad content, job descriptions, screener questions, and target URLs; (b) websites reachable from target URLs or your Ad; and (c) ensuring that your use of the Ads Program, the Site, and Indeed Apps are lawful and will not cause Indeed to violate any applicable law. Indeed’s publication of your Ad, or reformatting or addition of labels during publication (such as “Powered by Indeed”) does not alter your responsibility.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the right and authority to use the Program, including to provide or claim your Ads and job feed; (ii) all information you provide (through the Site or otherwise) is true, correct, and current; (iii) you hold and grant Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees all rights to use, copy, distribute, and display your User Content; and (iv) such use and websites linked from your Ads will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable law.
You shall not cause, authorize, or contribute to: (1) automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid Site activity such as impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPs, Started Applications, or Applications; (2) manipulation of Ad placement, bidding, or any other part of the Site or Indeed Apps; (3) inaccurate reporting of any measurements of user activity including applications; (4) circumventing charges you owe to Indeed, such as by preventing the reporting of an application; (5) advertisement of goods or services through the Site; or (6) anything unlawful or fraudulent. Indeed reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate accounts suspected of such activity without notice, and to take corresponding legal action.
Indeed may choose not to accept any Ads for any or no reason.Indeed further reserves the right to disable or terminate any Employer’s account, for any or no reason, without notice
. Although Indeed may provide information related to our decision-making process, we cannot give every reason why an account may be terminated or an Ad may be removed. The Indeed team responsible for maintaining the quality of the Site is independent, and its decisions are final and not subject to review.
6. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
THE ADS PROGRAM, THE SITE, AND INDEED APPS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SERVICE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

CLICKS AND OTHER USER ACTIVITY ARE ANONYMOUS, AND INDEED HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONFIRMING A USER’S IDENTITY. USER ACTIVITY SUCH AS AN IMPRESSION, CLICK, STARTED RSVP, RSVP, STARTED APPLICATION, OR APPLICATION IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF INTEREST IN YOUR AD OR JOB. INDEED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CLICK FRAUD, FRAUDULENT LEADS, TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES, OR OTHER POTENTIALLY INVALID ACTIVITY BY THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY AFFECT THE COST OF ADS.
EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 8 HEREUNDER, AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTIONS 3, 4, OR 5, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (i) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE IAP TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (ii) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE IAP TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU FOR THE ADS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

Indeed Resume Search/Smart Sourcing Program Terms
These Indeed Resume Search Program Terms or Indeed CV Search Program Terms or Smart Sourcing Terms (collectively, “IRSP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the
Indeed Terms of Service
(the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer that accesses or uses the Indeed Resume Search also known as “Smart Sourcing” offering, or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these IRSP Terms. By agreeing to the IRSP Terms, you also agree to the
Indeed Terms of Service
.
Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IRSP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
1. The Program
Use of the Indeed Resume Search Program/CV Search Program, also known as “Smart Sourcing” (“Program” or “IRSP”) by an individual / Job Seeker who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, “Resume Owner”) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, on the subscription or plan purchase page, and on the FAQ and information page(s) for the country you are purchasing a subscription or plan for, any or all of which may be modified at any time. You agree and acknowledge that the Program pricing and offerings are subject to change. Purchasing additional subscriptions or plans, or modifying subscriptions or plans may reset the monthly billing date for subscriptions or plans associated with your account, resulting in pro rata charges to account for the new date. If you purchase a new plan in India during the duration of your current plan, the new plan will begin after your current plan ends. You shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners or other individuals, through the Site, for purposes of filling your Job Listings. You shall not use the Indeed Resume Search Program for  any directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, or fraudulent purpose. You are solely responsible for your use of the Program, including but not limited to, how you search for Job Seekers, who you decide to contact, and any employment related decisions you make. Please note that contacts expire six months from the date of subscription purchase. Contacts that you receive via a special offer expire six months from the date you redeem that offer, unless otherwise stated in the offer. Contact information provided by Indeed, including any Relay Service email address, is for your individual use only and may not be shared with any other person. You are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a resume, in order to circumvent the resume contact system. Use of such a product or system will result in your immediate termination from the Program. In addition, as a feature of the Program, Indeed may send emails to Resume Owners on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for their resume. In some circumstances, Indeed may limit the number and/or frequency of times you may contact a Resume Owner or any individual through the Site. For example, if you contact a Resume Owner, and the Resume Owner does not express interest or contact you back, you may not be able to contact them again for a period of time.
IMPORTANT NOTICE : YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: in purchasing or obtaining access to the Program, you are paying Indeed the amount indicated on the Site for the purpose of Indeed facilitating your contact with a Resume Owner by sending a message to the email address that the relevant Resume Owner has provided to Indeed, or by connecting you via phone call to the number provided by the Resume Owner. Your use of the Program is subject to all Indeed Site Rules and policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and any policies pertaining to Relay Services. Indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message will be received, read, or acted upon by any potential Resume Owner or job seeker, or that any individual or Resume Owner’s resume or information thereof is valid, accurate or complete in any respect.
Indeed may return different results for the same resume search query and has full discretion with respect to the resumes or profiles it presents in response to any particular search.
Indeed does not allow its Program, including but not limited to, resume contact service to be used in a spam like manner, and you expressly agree not to use the Program service in such manner. Indeed defines “spam like manner” as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by Indeed experience and/or Resume Owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role or who have indicated that such requests are unwanted. Indeed reserves the right to disable Indeed Resume Search contact service for any user who, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates these IRSP Terms, including the foregoing term. We reserve the right to drop any message, including without limitation dropping any message with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .so, .dll, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment or any other attachment containing scripts, macros, or other code, or other messages that Indeed suspects to be malicious or spam, or for any or no reason.
The only acceptable use of the Program is for you to contact a Resume Owner or individual through the Site regarding a Job Listing or potential employment. No other uses of the Program are permitted.
Scraping or data mining the Indeed Resume Search database, which may include any Job Seeker Resume, or using the Indeed Resume Search or “Smart Sourcing” database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you. We may in our sole discretion place limits on your ability to run searches using the Program if we suspect that your use may adversely affect Indeed’s system, you are using the Program in a malicious or objectionable manner, or you have violated this Agreement. Additionally, if you are a competitor of Indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) you may not use the Indeed Program or Resume Search or Smart Sourcing database to contact a Resume Owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients, and any such competitive use of the Program or Indeed Resume Search or Smart Sourcing database may result in Indeed blocking you from the Site, blocking you from contacting Resume Owners, and blocking your contact emails to those Resume Owners without notice and you consent to the same. Indeed may limit the number of devices each account is logged into. Each Resume or Smart Sourcing subscription or plan is solely for the individual use of the person to whom it is assigned, and may not be shared with other users. If you have a plan in India, you agree that adding seats to the plan does not add additional contacts to the subscription plan; if you add a seat on a day after the subscription plan has started, the price you pay for that seat is prorated, however, the number of contacts remains unaffected. For plans in India, once the time period on your subscription plan expires, so will any remaining contacts; no unused contacts will carry over to your new plan.
In the event phone numbers are provided by the Resume Owner in the resume, Indeed does not guarantee their validity and cannot confirm whether such numbers are landlines or cell phones. You agree to call Resume Owner regarding relevant job opportunities only. It is your sole responsibility to comply with all TCPA guidelines, as well as other laws against automated telephone dialling systems or laws governing phone or mobile communications in your applicable jurisdiction.
Information contained in Resume Owner resumes is self-reported by Job Seekers, may be outdated or inaccurate, and is not verified by Indeed. Any filtering, sorting, matching, or ranking tools available to you as part of the Program rely on this Job Seeker-provided information and/or information you provide to Indeed about your job requirements or preferences. The appearance of a given Job Seeker’s resume in search results or as a match is not a guarantee that the Resume Owner has the attributes or experience you have selected or that they would be interested in a job. When you use the Program, Indeed does not guarantee that you will see desirable, or any, search results in response to each query or that you will see desirable, or any, daily matches. You are solely responsible for determining or verifying any Resume Owner provided information or any publicly available information, including whether a Resume Owner / Job Seeker has a certain license, certification, or security clearance.
In a product on the Site, you may see a verification of a Job Seeker’s skills, certifications, or other qualifications.  Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such verifications or information, and you are solely responsible for verifying information on the Site.
In the United States, Indeed may make publicly available information aggregated from various sources searchable by third parties (like Employers) through the Program. We make that information available on a limited basis and for a limited time to help Employers find and connect with potential job seekers about an Employer’s Job Listings or job opportunities, and such information may not be used for any other purpose. You may remove your publicly available information from the Program and unsubscribe from receiving potential job opportunities from Employers by following the unsubscribe link in our messages. To delete your publicly available information from our Site, submit this
form
.
2. Cancellation
Once you have requested that Indeed contact a Resume Owner, you may not revoke such request. Cancellation of your use of the Program shall be in accordance with any cancellation policies listed on the Site.
When you cancel or downgrade your subscription or plan, your access to the Program features will change accordingly. For example, you will lose access to features that are exclusive to the higher subscription or plan.
Indeed reserves the right to cancel any subscription at any time and for any or no reason. Indeed may immediately cancel, update or modify the Program or these IRSP Terms in our sole discretion at any time without liability and your use of the Program after notice that the Program or these IRSP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IRSP Terms. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IRSP Terms.
3. Your Information
You represent and warrant that all information you provide to Indeed is correct and current. You represent to Indeed that you are an Employer interested in considering the Resume Owner as a potential employee.
4. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY THAT ANY EMAIL ADDRESS THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO INDEED IS VALID, THAT ANY EMAIL SENT BY INDEED AT YOUR REQUEST WILL REACH THE INTENDED RECIPIENT, THAT ANY INTENDED RECIPIENT OF ANY SUCH EMAIL WILL READ SUCH EMAIL, OR THAT ANY SUCH INTENDED RECIPIENT WILL ACT UPON SUCH EMAIL. FURTHER, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY THAT ANY RESUME IS AVAILABLE OR VIEWABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME, OR THAT ANY RESUME DESCRIBES AN APPLICANT’S SKILLS, QUALIFICATIONS, OR ABILITIES. INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, SERVICE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. YOU USE THE SITE AND THE PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK. INDEED DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SITE OR PROGRAM WILL ALWAYS BE ERROR FREE, SAFE, OR SECURE.
EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 HEREUNDER AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTION 1, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE PROGRAM TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE PROGRAM TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU FOR THE INDEED RESUME SEARCH SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
5. Payment
You shall be charged if, and as, indicated by the Site. Upon your request, Indeed may in its sole discretion pause your subscription or plan and associated cost, and upon Indeed unpausing the subscription or plan, it will continue for the remaining term until it expires and automatically renews. Details regarding the resume subscription plan are available on the Site. If your billing address is in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US Dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the
Asia-Pacific Region*
, you may only pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and US Dollars. If your billing address is anywhere else, you may be able to pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euro, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, Mexican Pesos, or Japanese Yen. This choice of currencies will be fully subject to Indeed’s discretion. Charges are exclusive of taxes, including VAT. You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 120 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODIC ALLOTMENTS UNDER THE APPLICABLE RESUME SUBSCRIPTION OR PLAN. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of credit for Indeed services. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card, bank account, and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore. Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail, unless otherwise specified by Indeed. Except for plans in India, if you purchase a subscription or plan, you acknowledge and agree that your subscription or plan will automatically renew and Indeed will charge you on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription or plan and such cancellation goes into effect, which may not be until the next billing cycle. Pausing your subscription or plan does not cancel it. Your subscription will continue to automatically renew after being unpaused. The applicable billing cycle (e.g. monthly or annual, etc.) will depend upon the terms agreed upon.
6. Indemnification
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of your use of the Program, including but not limited to, how you conduct the search, any contact you have with the recipient (or intended recipient), any email you request to be sent pursuant to these Program Terms, any phone call or text message you make to a recipient, and activities of any third party service provider you engage to facilitate your sourcing activities through the Program, such as an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).

1.  The APIs
Indeed may provide you with access to one or more APIs, as well as any accompanying Documentation, solely for your internal business use in developing and using Applications or for Indeed to process and analyze submitted information and behavioral data in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims any and all liability for the accuracy, content, completeness, legality, reliability, operability or availability of information or material on or through any API. For the most up to date and accurate information, use the Site directly.
Your license is subject to and conditioned on your compliance with all terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, and it is revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable. No implied license is granted. Indeed reserves all rights that are not expressly granted by this Agreement.
You may develop an Application that interoperates with an Indeed API for the use of your employees or independent contractors for your internal business purposes. Your and End Users’ use of an API or Application to access the Site or any Indeed App is subject to the applicable Terms of Service for the Site or Indeed App, and you agree to require your End Users to accept and comply with such Terms of Service as well as these API Terms. You agree that you will be responsible for your End Users’ use of your Application and any API.
It is also you and your End Users’ responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App or the Site in order to obtain the most up-to-date information (including, but not limited to, explanations about how features work, disclaimers and disclosures regarding the services provided, method for charging) about Indeed’s products and services. By using an Application or Applicant Tracking System (“ATS”) via an API, rather than directly using the Site or an Indeed App, you agree to all information provided on the Site or an Indeed App. Use of an Application or ATS via an API, rather than direct use of the Site or an Indeed App, shall not excuse any lack of information or understanding about Indeed’s products and services, where that information is otherwise provided on the Site or an Indeed App.
You agree that Indeed may monitor your and End Users’ use of any API and may process and analyze submitted information and behavioral data in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy. This monitoring may include Indeed accessing and using your Application. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Indeed may use any technical means to overcome such interference. You agree that when you or End Users’ use an ATS via an API, such ATS may access, monitor, process, or analyze submitted information and behavioral data. If you, or anyone on your behalf, send or receive communication via API (including by sending or receiving communication to/from an email address aliased by Indeed and/or by using a different email address from the one associated with your account), you agree to the communication being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.
You agree to promptly notify Indeed in advance of your decision to discontinue use of any APIs that allow Indeed to process and analyze submitted information and behavioral data.
By using Indeed’s API you understand and agree to periodic audits of your usage. Indeed will request, and you will provide (or cause your agent to provide), your data usage metrics in order for Indeed to review. If Indeed finds you have violated these guidelines, your use of Indeed’s API may be restricted or terminated.
Indeed may update, modify or discontinue the API at any time and in our sole discretion and without liability to you, and may require you to obtain and use the most recent version. You are required to update your Application accordingly at your sole expense. You acknowledge that Indeed’s update to an API may adversely affect how your Application communicates with the Site or an Indeed App, and you agree that Indeed will have no liability therefrom. Your use of an API after an update by Indeed constitutes acceptance of the update. Indeed reserves the right to develop products or services that are similar to, or may compete with, any Application.
2. Limitations, Restrictions and Security
Accessing and using the Site or any Indeed App through an API is subject to the Site Rules, these API Terms, and any additional rules, guidelines, and policies made available by Indeed. Such additional rules, guidelines, or policies may be detailed in the Documentation (including in the
Indeed Developer Portal
), these API Terms, or otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. For example, by using the Indeed Apply API in connection with your Job Listings, you agree not to require or otherwise burden a Job Seeker to submit a duplicate application through other means if that Job Seeker already applied to your Job Listing using Indeed Apply. You further agree to accurately describe to a Job Seeker what information and data you collect from and about that Job Seeker when they apply to your job using Indeed Apply, including how you handle and share such information and data. You also agree to honor a Job Seeker request for their information and data that you collect in connection with any API. Further, by using the Indeed Apply API, you agree to use HTTPS POST URL(s).
You agree to do all the following in connection with your access and use of any API or development or use of any Application: (a) comply with the Agreement, the API terms, the Site Rules, all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and all guidelines, standards, and requirements that may be made available to you by Indeed (including those stated in the
Indeed Developer Portal
); (b) monitor the use of your Applications for any activity that violates these API terms; (c) promptly restrict any End Users who violate these API Terms from further use of your Application; and (d) promptly notify Indeed of any violation of these API Terms by you or End Users.
You acknowledge and agree that Indeed sets and enforces limits on your use of and access to any API (including by limiting the number of API calls or API requests you may make or the number of users you may serve). Indeed monitors usage of the APIs to enforce these limits, in its sole discretion. Such limits may be detailed in the Documentation or otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. When you reach those limits, Indeed will restrict or terminate your API access or API Key at any time and without prior notice.
Access to the Sponsored Jobs API is limited to users and End Users who actively spend to sponsor a Job Ad through a monthly campaign. When you or your End User do not actively spend to sponsor a Job Ad through a monthly campaign, you agree that your and your End User’s access to the Sponsored Jobs API will be disabled or terminated without prior notice. You agree that you or your End User (whoever is the billing entity on record accessing the API) shall be charged for each call or request that you make to the Sponsored Jobs API if, and as, indicated on the Site, in the Documentation (including in the Indeed Developer Portal), or as otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. By accessing or using the Sponsored Jobs API, you or your End User may incur a charge whenever your or your End User’s monthly spend to sponsor Job Ads via monthly campaign(s) is less than the calculated total monthly cost of using the API as determined by Indeed and indicated on the Site, in the Documentation (including in the Indeed Developer Portal), or as otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. Spend on Job Ads sponsored with daily budgets is not considered when determining if you or your End User will incur a charge. Charges are solely based on Indeed’s measurements, and Indeed’s measurements shall be binding. It is your and your End Users’ responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App, the Site, or Documentation (which may be updated from time to time at Indeed’s sole discretion) to obtain the most up to date information regarding payment and how Indeed charges you or your End User for your use or your End User’s use of Indeed’s products and services, including any API.
You agree that neither you, your Application, nor your End Users, will do any of the following in connection with your access or use of any API or development or use of any Application: (a) violate any Site Rule or other rule or policy pertaining to the Site, or any applicable law or regulation; (b) copy, duplicate, modify, or create derivative works of an API, in whole or in part; (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to any source code component of any API; (d) remove any proprietary notices from any materials available through any API; (e) make an API or Application available to a third party except as permitted by a written agreement with Indeed; (f) circumvent any limits on API access imposed by Indeed; (g) scrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of any User Content, except as expressly permitted by the Documentation or Indeed; or (h) modify, misrepresent, or otherwise manipulate data provided by any API.
When reporting Indeed data provided by any API, you agree to accurately represent such data. You agree that such data shall not include: (a) blended third-party fees, including fees from the entity calling the API; (b) data from third parties such as other advertising providers; or (c) sponsored data blended with organic data. If using an API to provide Indeed services to an Employer, you agree to provide accurate reporting to the Employer about the services obtained through the use of the API and the value that the services provided represent. You agree to report data to Employers in an accurate, organized and digestible manner that allows Employers to filter and sort categories of data such as clicks, apply starts, costs of Indeed services isolated from other service providers’ costs including your own, and other metrics.
You agree to provide and adhere to a Privacy Policy for your Application that accurately describes to End Users and/or Job Seekers what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Indeed and other third parties. You further agree to protect all such information in accordance with applicable laws, and not to access or use such information (especially personal data) except as required to provide Indeed services to an Employer through your Application.
If you use or access any Indeed API or Documentation to provide Indeed services to an Employer, you acknowledge and agree that you will not access personal data (as defined by applicable Data Protection law) to provide Indeed services to an Employer. However, if you have received personal data from Indeed that is not required to provide Indeed services to an Employer, you shall notify Indeed and return or destroy such personal data (as instructed by Indeed). Should you and Indeed agree that you will process personal data in connection with providing Indeed services, your general responsibilities (regarding the nature and purpose of access, security controls and protocols, international transfer of data, etc.) will be set forth in a Data Processing Addendum.
Security Measures.
The Site, APIs and Applications may contain technological measures designed to prevent unauthorized or illegal use of the Indeed properties. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Indeed may use these and other lawful measures to verify your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the API Terms, and enforce Indeed’s rights, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Indeed Applications and APIs; (ii) Indeed may deny anyone access to and/or use of the Site, APIs or Applications; and (iii) Indeed and its representatives may collect, maintain, process, and use diagnostic, technical, usage, and related information, including information about your computers, systems and software, that Indeed may gather in the course of providing the APIs, Indeed Applications or the Site. This information will be treated in accordance with the
Indeed Terms of Service
and
Privacy Policy
, as amended from time to time; and (iv) you shall employ no less than industry-standard best practices with regard to protecting access to Indeed APIs and Indeed Confidential Information, and shall maintain data security and disaster avoidance policies and procedures designed to safeguard Indeed APIs, data and Indeed Confidential Information.
Security Standards
. You shall maintain security practices that: (i) include adequate and appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, including underlying operating system and network security controls and, (ii) are designed to meet or exceed industry-standard best practices and, (iii) comply with Indeed’s information security policies to the extent disclosed in writing to you. Such security practices shall include without limitation: (i) continuous monitoring for security threats and security incidents and, (ii) use of firewalls and real-time intrusion detection systems, encryption and other secure technologies to collect, store and/or transmit Indeed data and, (iii) application of physical security procedures, including security guards, and regular monitoring of all areas in which Indeed data is stored or Indeed APIs or Applications accessed and, (iv) restriction on access to Indeed APIs and Applications, and copying of Indeed data on a “need-to-know” basis and only at authorized locations and, (v) performance of background checks on your personnel with access to Indeed APIs, Applications or data and, (vi) ensuring regular monitoring of password procedures used to gain access to Indeed APIs, Applications or data and, (vii) application of VPN and dual-factor authentication for your corporate systems and, (viii) having in place system(s) to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
Security Records and Audit.
While using the APIs or Applications, and for one (1) year thereafter, you shall: (i) maintain complete and accurate records relating to your data protection practices and the security of and access to Indeed APIs, Applications, data and Confidential Information, including any backup, disaster recovery or other policies, practices or procedures and, (ii) upon Indeed’s request, make all such records, appropriate personnel and relevant materials available during normal business hours for inspection and audit by Indeed and/or its designee(s). Indeed shall give you at least fifteen (15) days prior notice of any audit, undertake audits no more than once per calendar year (or more frequently for a good cause shown), and conduct any audit in a manner designed to minimize disruption of your normal business operations. The foregoing limitations shall not apply to any audit in connection with the unauthorized disclosure of or access to Indeed APIs, Applications, data or Confidential Information.
Data Breaches
. You must immediately report any suspected or actual security or data breach (as defined under applicable laws) involving Indeed APIs, Applications, data or Confidential information. You shall promptly take all necessary corrective actions, and shall cooperate with Indeed in all reasonable and lawful efforts to prevent, mitigate, or rectify a data breach. You shall also provide Indeed reasonable access to the related reports and documentation needed to understand the cause of the security or data breach. Except as prohibited by applicable law, the content of any filings, communications, notices, press releases or reports related to data breach related to Indeed must be prepared in cooperation with Indeed before any publication or communication thereof.
Harmful Code.
You shall not transmit to Indeed or upload to or through the Integrations any Harmful Code, or use or misappropriate the Integrations for your own commercial gain or any other reason. Indeed reserves the right to use a variety of methods to detect, block and screen the above anomalous activity and to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud. Such measures may result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of your access to the Indeed APIs, Applications or your Integrations, or of your use of any other functions of the Indeed APIs, Applications or your Integrations with or without notice. Indeed shall not be responsible or liable for any such suspension or termination, including any consequences thereof.

Indeed Hiring Platform Terms
These Indeed Hiring Platform terms (“IHP Terms”) form part of, and are incorporated into the
Indeed Terms of Service
, and apply to any Employer or Job Seeker who accesses or uses the Indeed Hiring Platform or related services, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these IHP Terms. By accessing or using the Indeed Hiring Platform or related services or otherwise accepting these IHP Terms, you agree to these IHP Terms and to the
Indeed Terms of Service
(the “Agreement”), including the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using as part of the Indeed Hiring Platform.
Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IHP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
1. The Program
Indeed Hiring Platform is a platform designed to automate and streamline your hiring and employment decision-making processes by allowing users access to various products such as Indeed Interview or related services (the “Program”). You understand that use of the Program and related products is at your sole discretion and such tools are applied to your hiring process and job openings in the method and manner that you decide. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE LAW REGARDING YOUR EMPLOYMENT AND HIRING PRACTICES, INCLUDING TITLE VII, AND THAT YOU MUST INDEMNIFY INDEED AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF INDEED HIRING PLATFORM OR SIMILAR PRODUCTS. INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES COMPLIES WITH TITLE VII OR ANY SIMILAR LAW. Indeed makes no representation that Indeed or its affiliates are an employment agency by offering the Program and related tools. You understand that Indeed is not procuring employees for you or opportunities for Job Seekers.
By using the Program and accepting these IHP Terms you acknowledge and agree that you are asking Indeed to do the following: 1) post, on your behalf, Job Listings or Job Ads, as applicable, provided by you on the Site, and manage such ad campaign, using information such as the number of RSVPs or Started RSVPs, 2) include an RSVP function on the Site for a hiring event, interview session or interview post (“Event”) corresponding with each of your Job Ads or Listings, 3) receive from Job Seekers RSVPs to your Event(s), 4) add any screening tools you choose, including, but not limited to screening questions, evaluation methods, 5) send to you and/or other persons you identify information provided by a Job Seeker who RSVPs to your Event(s), and 6) communicate (via email or text message) information related to your Event(s) to Job Seekers who have RSVPed to your Event(s). If you request that Indeed send you and other persons you identify information provided by a Job Seeker who RSVPs to the Event(s), you certify and warrant that such person is part of your organization or is otherwise authorized to receive such information.
With regards to any Job Ad posted on the Site via the Program, including any Job Ad of your Event posted in Indeed’s discretion, you agree that such Job Ad shall be subject to the Indeed Ads Program terms, and the Indeed Ads Program terms are incorporated herein. Likewise, your use of any tools offered by Indeed is subject to the applicable Terms of Service. For example, using Resume Search or Smart Sourcing is subject to the Indeed Resume Search/Smart Sourcing Program Terms.
You further agree that you are solely responsible for everything regarding your Event(s), whether participating or hosting, including but not limited to, the content of the Job Listing or Job Ad, screening or screener questions, the handling and safeguarding of Job Seeker information provided to you and/or other persons you identify as authorized to receive information regarding an Event or a Job Seeker, the Event location, your attendees at the Event, or any literature, signage or other documentation at the event. You are responsible for accommodating Job Seeker requests or needs during the interview or application process during the Event. You represent and warrant that any data you collect from attendees and share with Indeed is collected in accordance with local privacy rules. Moreover, you grant to Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees the license to use your name, user name, and/or trademarks and logos in connection with any User Content or Indeed marketing materials, or actions by Indeed to promote or publicize such User Content (e.g. Job Listings) including the use of keywords in third-party internet search engine. You agree that Indeed may promote your Job Listing or Job Ad through any method in Indeed’s sole discretion, including but not limited to targeted advertising, on third party websites, including, but not limited to apps, or using keywords in third-party internet search engines. You further acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not responsible for reviewing qualifications, verifying identification, or otherwise screening Job Seekers during each Event and that you are solely responsible for so doing.
When Job Seekers apply or RSVP to your job listing, Indeed may give them the opportunity to provide certain demographic information, such as race and ethnicity, gender, age, LGBTQ+ community membership, and disability status as well as whether they have an arrest or conviction record (“demographic data”).  This Indeed demographic data survey is separate from any voluntary self-identification questions provided by Employers. By using the Program, you agree that Indeed may collect demographic data from Job Seekers applying to your job listing using Indeed’s demographic survey, and that Indeed may use the information from that survey to evaluate and improve our products. You further agree that you as an Employer have no ability, right, or entitlement to view or access demographic data collected via the Indeed demographic data survey pertaining to any Job Seeker or related to any employer by any means including civil discovery, subpoena, or any other legal process without their permission. You agree you are solely responsible for complying with applicable nondiscrimination laws. Indeed disclaims any warranty regarding the demographic composition of Job Seekers applying to any particular job.
Indeed may offer you the option to manage virtual and remote communications within Indeed products, including Indeed Interview, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”). Services may include giving you access to scheduling, video conferencing, web conferencing, meeting rooms, and other collaborative services offered by third-party telecommunications service providers. You understand and acknowledge that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider. Indeed disclaims all warranties regarding the transmission of Virtual Interviews including phone or video communications. Indeed does not guarantee (1) the availability of such services at the time you attempt to initiate them, (2) the quality of such services, or (3) the dates or times you’ve arranged for your Virtual Interview.
2. Cancellation
Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel any Job Listing or Job Ad (and corresponding Event) at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours). However, if you cancel an Event, Indeed will still bill you in accordance with any pricing listed in a separate agreement or otherwise agreed upon by you and Indeed, for RSVPs, clicks, applies or impressions accrued while the Job Ad for that Event was on the Site, and any platform fee, if applicable. Indeed may reach out to Job Seekers to communicate your Event cancellation. Indeed may immediately cancel the Program, any part thereof, or these IHP Terms at any time upon notice. Indeed may modify the Program or these IHP Terms at any time without liability, and your use of the Program after notice that these IHP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IHP Terms. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IHP Terms.
3. Prohibited Uses
You shall not, and shall not authorize or assist any party to, advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent activities or business practices in any state or country where your Job Listing or Job Ad is displayed. You represent and warrant that all your information and any and all information you provide to Indeed is correct and current; you hold and grant Indeed and partners all rights to copy, distribute, and display Job Listings or Job Ads (“Use”); and such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Listings or Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws. Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IHP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences. Indeed or partners may reject or remove any Job Listing, Job Ad, or content therein, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.
4. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON- INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, SERVICE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

Indeed and its affiliates, and its and their third-party licensors, disclaim all guarantees regarding positioning or the levels or timing of: costs per RSVP, click, apply, or impression, (ii) RSVP rates, click through rates, apply rates, or impression rates (including any estimate of rates provided in an insertion order), (iii) delivery of any impressions in any particular time, place, or manner, (iv) RSVPs, clicks, applies or impressions, (v) interest in your Job Ad, (vi) attendance at your Event(s), and (vii) the quality of attendees at your Event(s). AN RSVP TO YOUR EVENT(S) DOES NOT GUARANTEE INTEREST IN YOUR JOB AD. EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 HEREUNDER, AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTION 1, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE IHP TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE IHP TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR THE JOB ADS OR JOB LISTINGS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
5. Payment
You shall be charged in accordance with the pricing listed in a separate agreement or insertion order between you and Indeed, and based on clicks, RSVPs, applies or impressions (distributed within your budget in Indeed’s sole discretion) and platform fee, if applicable. Indeed may offer a subscription payment option wherein you will be charged as indicated in an insertion order. RSVPs are defined as a user completing the online RSVP form agreeing to attend your Event featured in any Job Ad. However, an RSVP does not guarantee that a Job Seeker will attend such Event. If your Indeed employer account has a credit card, bank account information, or other payment method on file for the Indeed Ads Program or any other Indeed service, we will charge that same payment method for your Indeed Hiring Platform RSVPs, if applicable.
If you are located in the United States, you shall pay all applicable charges in US dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the Asia-Pacific Region*, you may only pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and US Dollars. If your billing address is anywhere else, you may pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euros, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, Mexican Pesos, or Japanese Yen. Charges are exclusive of all taxes, including VAT. You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 120 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Indeed’s click, RSVP, apply, or impression measurements. Indeed’s determination of number of clicks, RSVPs, applies or impressions shall be binding.
You acknowledge and agree that any credit card, bank account, and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.
All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore. Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance.
6. Indemnification
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, licensors, and partners from any third party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of your Program use, Job Listing, Job Ad, screening or screener questions, Event, Site or Your Services, or breach of these IHP Terms.

We do not want you to wonder about any of our processes or procedures or guess as to what your interaction with Indeed means. We want you to understand it, which is why we must explain it in detail.

A. Terms of Service for Job Seekers
For purposes of this Section A of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as a Job Seeker. As a Job Seeker, you are permitted to use Indeed’s Site and its content solely for non-commercial purposes. You further agree that the
Terms of Service for All Users
also apply. For the avoidance of doubt where the Terms of Service for All Users overlap or conflict with the Terms of Service for Job Seekers, you agree that the Terms of Service for Job Seekers will govern.
1. Job Ads or Job Listings
Indeed may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through the Site’s search results or otherwise through the Site. Searching for Job Ads on the Site is free for Job Seekers. The Site displays Job Ads based on a combination of compensation paid by employers to Indeed and relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted on the Site. While Indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Indeed job search free for Job Seekers, all Job Ads are considered advertising.
Job Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that Indeed has no control over the content of Job Ads, links to or from Job Ads, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site. For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Indeed endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site. If you leave the Indeed Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party. Except for sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner. Indeed has no obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job Ads, in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Ads from the Site or your search result without any obligation to provide reasoning for removal or exclusion. You understand and agree that Indeed has no obligation to present you with any or all Job Ads. We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Ad or other information submitted by any Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user. Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Ads, or other information submitted by any Employer or other user.
When you initiate a job application on a website operated by an Employer or its applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as via Application Programming Interfaces (API), cookies, pixels and web beacons. The information collected includes, for example, information about job listings you viewed and job applications you started and completed. An Employer who uses tracker functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law. Indeed has no control over such an Employer or its website. Indeed’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such tracker functionality will be according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed may provide independent functionality to assist you. For example, Indeed may provide search options to help you narrow down Job Ads search results by job type categories (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the Job Ads. In some cases, Indeed may automatically apply search options to your Job Ad search results, which may be based on information from your Profile or your activity on the Site, but you can turn off any automatically applied search option at any time. Indeed may reformat Job Listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile phone. Indeed may also promote Job Ads by select Employers on certain pages or websites dedicated to a specific topic, such as inclusive hiring, or military-friendly job posts. The placement of a Job Ad on a dedicated page or website is not a representation regarding the nature of the role for legal purposes (for example gig economy postings are not necessarily limited to contractor status jobs and may also include engagements for employment relationships) or a representation regarding the attributes of an Employer. Indeed does not guarantee that applying to jobs through a dedicated page or website will lead to a better job application experience, a job interview, or a job offer. The dedicated pages or website do not contain an exhaustive list of Job Ads, and no  inferences can be drawn with respect to Job Ads or Employers that are not displayed on dedicated pages. Indeed may also provide functionality to call a telephone number contained in a Job Ad using the phone app on a mobile device. Indeed cannot guarantee that the extracted phone number is the correct phone number for the Employer or for the Job Ad you are viewing.
2. Resume and Profile
By creating or adding information to a profile through the Site or uploading a file resume on the Site (collectively, “Your Profile” or “Job Seeker Profile” or “Indeed Profile”), you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available Your Indeed Profile to anyone accessing our Site, such as Employers that Indeed believes may have an interest in Your Profile, users of Indeed’s Resume Search Program or Smart Sourcing, or anyone with access to the URL associated with your searchable Profile. We offer you the option to make Your Profile searchable on the Site to help you find a job. You are responsible for keeping Your Profile accurate and up-to-date. Any information that you submit through the Site, including information in Your Profile, is subject to this Agreement (including Sections D.3 and D.4.) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
When you create or add information to Your Profile on the Site, Your Profile is set to searchable on the Site (“Searchable”) by default. If you do not want Indeed to make Your Profile available to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Indeed Profile and uploaded file resume to not searchable or “cannot be found” through the Site (“Not Searchable”). This can be done by going to your “Profile” page and changing the settings to “not searchable” or “employers can’t find you on Indeed.” Profiles that are not searchable on the Site are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker has submitted an application or provided their resume. Applying to jobs or otherwise sharing Your Profile with Employers may result in Your Profile being copied and published even if it is set to Not Searchable. While you may change Your Profile privacy settings at any time, setting Your Profile to Not Searchable will not affect your previous applications or prevent employers you responded to from contacting you. Profiles set to Searchable, including yours, can be copied by search engines and other third parties accessing the Site, who can then make those Profiles publicly available elsewhere. Indeed does not control such third parties. If Your Profile is copied in this manner, then setting it to Not Searchable on the Site will not affect those third parties or the copies they have made of Your Profile. Changes to Your Profile on the Site may or may not be reflected on copies made by third parties. Even if your Profile is set to Searchable, we may hide your Profile from your current or prior employers, but cannot guarantee that you will not be found by these employers. If you do not want Your Profile to ever be publicly visible or copyable, you must keep it set to Not Searchable. Indeed may set any Searchable Profile to Non-Searchable, or otherwise make it unavailable, if it contains content prohibited by this Agreement or for any other reason in Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Your Profile, your information, or application information that you share with Employers or otherwise make public. You can read more about privacy on Indeed
here
.
Do not include sensitive or confidential information, such as a background check, credit report, medical or health information, social security number or other identification numbers, in your Indeed Profile that you do not wish to be viewable by employers or others. If Indeed discovers or determines that data contained in your Indeed Profile is sensitive or confidential, we may hide that data from employers. We cannot guarantee that this data will not be shown to employers or others.
In the United States, Indeed may make publicly available information aggregated from various sources searchable by third parties (like Employers) through our Indeed Resume Search or Smart Sourcing offering. We make that information available on a limited basis and for a limited time to help connect you to potential Employers about their Job Listings or job opportunities, and such information is not used for apply purposes. You may remove your publicly available information from our Indeed Resume Search or Smart Sourcing offering and unsubscribe from receiving potential job opportunities from Employers by following the unsubscribe link in our messages. To delete your publicly available information from our Site, submit this
form
.
As we continue to improve the Site, you may see phrases like ‘Employers can find you’ and ‘Employers can’t find you’. For the purposes of the Terms, these phrases are synonymous with the previously employed terms ‘Searchable’ and ‘Not Searchable,’ respectively. These phrases are only a rephrasing for the purpose of enhancing user understanding, and they in no way alters the substantive rights, obligations, or protections provided under our Terms.
By creating or adding information or a resume to Your Profile, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed, or an Indeed vendor, to review or scan Your Profile and resume(s) and provide you feedback (at Indeed’s discretion), including suggested changes, other jobs you may consider applying to because your qualifications may match their requirements, and suggestions for additional information you may want to include with your application to a particular job. We may also provide you with feedback through additional resume review services, such as helping you understand how your resume or profile may be parsed by applicant tracking system software, feedback on ways to build a more effective resume or profile, or a personalized resume review video. We provide this feedback directly to you, and may give you the ability to access it within your account. It is not made available to Employers. You agree that your use of any feedback or other information provided through resume review services is at your sole discretion. You are the only one responsible for deciding which jobs to apply to and what to include in your applications. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any actions you take based on any provided feedback. Indeed does not guarantee that any recommended jobs are suited for you.
By creating or adding information to an Indeed Profile or uploading a file resume on the Site, Indeed may share with you Job Ads that match the contents of Your Profile. Indeed may also highlight to you items in Your Profile that may match qualifications from the Job Ad, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Ad and may be missing from Your Profile. These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it. Applying for such Job Ads does not guarantee job interviews or hiring. Even where Indeed highlights items or a Job Ad is shared with you, Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Ads or highlights. By uploading a file resume on the Site, you agree that Indeed may convert your file resume to a different file type. It is your responsibility to review Your Profile and resume to ensure that the content appears as you intend, and that it contains the right information or any information you intend to include or update. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so. It may take a few days for updates to your account or Your Profile to be reflected. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Your Profile or other application information you post, send or receive through the Site.
If you have an Indeed account, Indeed Resume, or an uploaded file resume, you agree that Indeed may associate any of this data with your Indeed Profile.  Your Indeed Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Profile” section of your account. This includes your Indeed Profile, your uploaded file resume or Indeed Resume, and any information that you choose to provide on the Site, such as your desired job title, job types, work schedule, qualifications, preferences, whether you are ready to work, or pay.
As we continue to improve the Site, you may be presented with the option to apply for a role using your Indeed Profile. Information in your Indeed Profile, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers. If you do not want Indeed to make your Indeed Profile available to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Indeed Profile to Not Searchable or remove information and resumes from Your Profile. When you create or upload a new version of your resume as part of an application, Indeed may automatically save that copy to your Indeed Profile. We may also offer you the option to save multiple versions of your resume to your Indeed Profile. Indeed will store the multiple versions of your resume at our discretion, and we reserve the right to discontinue storage or remove your resume from the Site for any reason, including for purposes of updates, improvements, or bug fixes without liability or notice. You are responsible for keeping your own copies of your resume. You can enable the ready to work feature on your Profile to let Employers know that you can start work immediately. Indeed may disable that feature from your Profile after a certain time, but you can manually enable it again.
To mitigate fraud, Indeed may mask or hide your contact information, for example, we may mask or hide your name, email address and/or phone number, from Your Profile, your resume, or application, and may substitute those with an alias (for example, your current or last job title in Your Profile). Indeed makes no promise to you about whether all or part of your contact info will be masked or hidden, and the decision to mask or hide such info is in Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed may also mask some or all of the Employer’s contact information, or an Employer may choose to mask their contact information when they contact you. In either case, you agree to an Employer contacting you from a masked phone number or email, and that you may not be able to return their call unless they provide their real number to you. Indeed reserves the right to limit your ability to set Your Profile to Searchable, and may toggle Your Profile to Not Searchable, at any time, to prevent illegal conduct, for fraud mitigation, or for any other reason in Indeed’s discretion. Indeed makes no guarantee that Your Profile will be shown to any particular Employer or that any portion of the Indeed Profile database will be available to an Employer at any particular time.
In certain markets, Indeed works with organizations who are involved in helping Job Seekers find opportunities. Notwithstanding the possible use of the term “partner” or “partnership,” Indeed’s engagement with these organizations does not create or imply a joint venture, partnership, principal-agent relationship, or any other form of joint enterprise between the “partner” organization and Indeed. In some instances, Indeed shares limited information back to these organizations about Job Seekers if Job Seekers agree to such sharing. For example, confirmation that a Job Seeker has created an Indeed account or used one of our Sites successfully (for example, by applying to a certain number of jobs or utilizing our career guides). These organizations may advertise their career services in partnership with Indeed. Indeed is not responsible for, and disclaims all responsibility and liability for the activities of these organizations and their career services. Indeed does not guarantee the quality or effectiveness of any advice, recommendations, guidance or services you may receive from these third parties. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Indeed will have no liability arising from any interactions you have with such a third party organization.
In connection with Indeed’s work with these organizations, Indeed may offer Job Seekers opportunities to present particular skills and qualifications on their Indeed Profile in connection with training programs or courses they have taken. Job Seekers are ultimately responsible for the contents of their resumes or Profiles, as well as their job searches and applications. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for Indeed Profiles or application information that Job Seekers share with Employers or otherwise make public. Indeed makes no guarantees regarding your job application experience, that your Indeed Profile or resume will be shown to a particular Employer, that Employers will contact you, or that you will receive job interviews or job offers.
3. Applying to Jobs Through the Site
Any profile, resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application or responses to screener or other questions (“Indeed Apply”), is subject to this Agreement (including Sections D.3 and D.4.) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy (all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Indeed”,  “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references mean  “Indeed Apply.”). To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Indeed in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Indeed services.  Use of any automation, scripting, or bots to automate the Indeed Apply process outside of Indeed’s official vendors and tooling is prohibited.
Prior to submitting your application through Indeed Apply, you will be given the opportunity to review the information. It is important that you review this information carefully, including all attached files, to ensure that what is being submitted is accurate and complete, and that you are applying to your desired Employer and submitting the desired information to that Employer. You are solely responsible for the contents of the application that you submit, including all attached files. Once you provide information to an Employer (whether in the form of a job application, Indeed Profile data, resume, email, interview material or otherwise), Indeed does not have control over the Employer’s use or disclosure of that information. If you want to request the Employer delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must make such a request directly to the Employer. Unsubscribing from calls from Employers through the Site does not apply to interviews you have already scheduled. If you require alternative methods for applying, you must approach the Employer directly to request such alternative method, as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process.
When you ask Indeed to submit your application or other information through Indeed Apply, you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for the indicated Job Listing(s). You further agree to Indeed’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such processing is an essential part of this Agreement. When you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Indeed Apply or the Site’s relay system, or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message. Additionally, your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through the Site will be processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
You acknowledge and agree that Employers may request that Indeed assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, and other information you provide to Indeed into one document, and you agree that in doing so, Indeed assembles these application materials on your behalf. When you apply to a job using Indeed Apply, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent, which may include sending your application to an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or other service provider selected by the Employer. You agree that Employers can enable such service providers to access and manage their Indeed accounts, including by connecting to and integrating with APIs provided or used by Indeed. By applying for a job through the Site, you agree to Employer’s use of such service providers, and acknowledge that such use may involve an intermediary’s access to job applications sent to its Employer client. We cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. Indeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. Indeed depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Indeed with the correct destination for all applications, and we cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by Employers. If the electronic destination provided to Indeed is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application. Further, Indeed does not guarantee that its integrations or the interface will be error-free. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
Job Ads may expire or otherwise be removed between the time you submit your application and the time it is received, in which cases your application will be void. Employers and third-party sites (including but not limited to ATSs) may reject applications for other reasons, such as duplicate applications, in which cases your application will be void. Indeed has no responsibility for expired or removed Job Ads, for delivering applications prior to a Job Ad’s expiration or removal, or for delivering applications that an Employer or third-party site, including but not limited to an ATS has otherwise rejected. Indeed and its third-party providers may store your application and related information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer available on the Site. We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third-party sites, including but not limited to ATSs. Third-party sites, including ATSs used by Employers, may disclaim liability for technical malfunctions, including the failure in the delivery of applications. We are not responsible if an ATS rejects or fails to deliver an application to an Employer for any reason. If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored by Indeed on Indeed’s or third-party providers’ servers, do not use the Indeed Apply or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public mail system. You may contact the Employer directly to find alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through the Site.
By using the Site, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s job application, requirements, messages, screener questions, skills assessments or their format or method of delivery, and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer. Please note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers. Employers are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar laws, anti-discrimination laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and any applicable data protection or privacy laws.
Employers are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law.
You must contact the Employer if you require alternative methods of screening. Some questions may be labeled as Optional, indicating only that the application may be submitted to the Employer without providing an answer. Indeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will consider such an application or make a particular determination with regard to such an application. Employers may ask applicants to voluntarily self-identify certain demographic information such as race, ethnicity, sex, disability and/or veteran status along with their job applications. Some Employers are required by law to ask these questions and you may see these questions when applying to jobs on the the Site. That is a separate process from Indeed’s collection of demographic data (see section 11, “Your Job Seeker Data,” below). Indeed is not responsible for these questions. If you have questions or concerns about an Employer’s application materials, please contact the Employer directly or refer to their privacy policy. Indeed does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs. Indeed cannot make any guarantee regarding health and safety measures in an Employer’s hiring or interviewing process. Indeed recommends Job Seekers follow personal health and safety best practices as recommended by the World Health Organization or similar institution.
Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations. Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.
By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought by the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections. Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist. Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application. These notices are automatically sent after a period of time selected by the Employer, unless the Employer indicates to Indeed their interest in your application. You acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer’s decision to activate Employer Assist and to not take an action on your application on the Site within the time period selected by the Employer. Any interactions the Employer has directly with you and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and would not by themselves prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent. Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Employer Assist notices.
By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to schedule interviews with Job Seekers who meet criteria (based on information the Job Seeker has provided to Indeed, such as answers to screener questions, resume or other information) that the Employers have selected, and based on the Employers’ availability. You agree that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these interview invitations (which are purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the availability or criteria the Employer provided to Indeed may not be accurate. Indeed may request that Job Seekers confirm their interest in the position before scheduling an interview. It is ultimately your and the Employer’s responsibility to confirm whether any interviews were scheduled, or to reschedule or cancel interviews if necessary. The decision of who to interview is decided solely by the Employer, who can choose to interview any Job Seeker at any time.
Indeed may offer Employers functionality that groups applicants based on whether they meet or may meet Employers’ criteria, based on text in their resumes or answers to screener questions. In all cases, Employers can view any applicant at any time, and Indeed makes no decisions about any applicant. You agree that such functionality does not constitute or contribute to a decision, and is not a substitute for human discretion and review. The Employer is solely responsible for its screening and hiring decisions.
When you search for jobs on the Indeed Job Search app and proceed to apply for a job, including jobs on third party sites, the Site may suggest information from your Indeed profile to include in your application. It is your responsibility to review suggestions before accepting them and including them on your application.
For Job Seekers located in Japan, you acknowledge that when Indeed is presented as Indeed Agent (hereinafter referred to as “Indeed Agent Japan”), Indeed is acting as an employment placement business provider (as defined under applicable law). Indeed Agent Japan offers the services in accordance with these terms and the rules set forth in
its website
. Indeed Agent Japan will only send you Job Listings that Indeed Agent Japan determines may be of interest to you. You may also end your relationship with Indeed Agent Japan at any time.
You acknowledge that as part of its efforts to combat fraud and spam, Indeed may require that users verify their email address. When you apply to a job through the Site, you agree that you may be required to verify your email address, and that failure to verify may lead to your application being rejected.
4. Job Matching and Recommended Jobs
Job matches are recommendations which may be presented to both you as a Job Seeker and to Employers in various formats on the Site. For example, Indeed may recommend Job Ads which are similar to jobs to which you recently applied, highlight certain aspects of Job Ads to you, or recommend Indeed Profiles to Employers which match Job Ads they post. Job matching is provided to you on a beta basis and is subject to our Beta Program (see section 9 of the Terms of Service for All Users).
To generate matches, Indeed uses data collected through our Site from both Employers and Job Seekers. This includes Job Ads, Your Profile information, information from your resume(s), your application materials (including responses to screener questions), and your activity on the Site (such as searches you run and Job Ads you click on and apply to). Indeed may use this information to present potential matches to you and to potential Employers.
Indeed may automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to apply to a job or the email that is associated with your Indeed account.
If you do not want to receive alerts for jobs that Indeed recommends to you, you can turn off ‘recommended jobs’ in your communications settings within your Indeed account.
If you do not want Your Profile, including your resume, to be matched by an Employer on the Site then you can set your information to ‘Not Searchable’ in Your Profile settings.
5. Communications and Other Actions on the Site
When you view, send, store or receive communications or materials (including Job Listings, resumes, messages, text messages, chats, emails, applications, questions and responses in applications, interview or other voice recordings or transcripts, and any other information)  to, on or through the Site, you agree to your activities, communication and materials being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service. To achieve these purposes, we use this data to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Indeed also uses vendors as an extension of the Site to collect, record, process, analyze, and store communication data. If you disagree with any part of these terms, do not use the Site.
When an Employer views, sends, stores or receives communications or materials to, on or through the Site, Indeed may inform you about such actions. Additionally, we may also inform you that an Employer has taken other actions with regards to a Job Ad, Your Profile, or your application, such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening Your Profile or application, viewing Your Profile or application, responding to Your Profile or application, and making a decision with regards to your application or Job Ad. As part of this functionality, you may receive notifications via the app, SMS, email or platform corresponding with your or an Employer’s (in the event you applied for a job) activity on or use of the Site, Indeed Apply, Indeed Messaging, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site. In all cases, such notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them. For example, if you accept an interview request, it is your responsibility to follow up with the employer separately to ensure they know your response, do not rely on notifications through the Site. Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message interview reminder from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled interviews with you. In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your phone number and that you have the right to accept text messages at the number. Indeed will only send you text message reminders for your interviews, and you agree to accept such text message reminders on your cell phone, including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system. You acknowledge that if the words “automated,” “automatic,” or similar words are used on the Site in connection with calls or text messages, these words do not refer to the generation or storage of a phone number. Indeed only calls the number that you generated and stored when you provided your number to Indeed. In the event you change your phone number, you agree to promptly update your Indeed account with the new number. You agree that by providing your phone number or using the Site, you are establishing a business relationship with Indeed and that Indeed may send you text messages in connection with that relationship.
Indeed may enable in-app messaging services (“Indeed Messaging”), as well as text messaging relay, email relay, and/or call relay services through our Site directly or through vendors to help facilitate contact between Employers and Job Seekers about a Job Listing. Indeed may also enable you and/or Employers to connect with each other on Indeed Messaging via third-party providers. You understand that communicating through Indeed Messaging and/or other communication options on or through the Site shall be limited to the purpose of applying for a Job Listing. Indeed reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to turn off or disable Indeed Messaging or other communication options for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice and for any or no reason. Please note that since relay services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays and other errors on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to send or receive communications, such as text messages, emails or calls.  We also do not guarantee that Indeed’s integrations with these third-party providers or interface will be error-free. Further, we do not guarantee that communications sent to or through Indeed Messaging will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.  In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
Indeed may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Employer. Once an Employer has your contact info, you agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the manner in which the Employer uses the info. When you or an Employer send a message to an Indeed provided alias, Indeed and its vendors will process the message to offer you services, display your message on the Site, and for other purposes as provided in this Agreement. For example, when you send or receive a message to an Indeed alias via email, Indeed will decide how and what to extract and display  on Indeed Messaging. Some messages related to the same conversation may not be grouped together. Indeed may also group messages together as part of a conversation on Indeed Messaging.  This is done as a courtesy, and some messages related to the same conversation may not be grouped together. When communicating with an Employer through the Site, the Employer sender’s information and any other conversation participant’s information may be displayed in different ways depending on the platform (browser or mobile) and whether the participant has an Indeed account. For example, you may see their Indeed account user name or company name, “Employer” or “Employee #”, “Guest (added from email)”, or as the email account sender display name of the person sending the message, if available, but you may not see all that info in all circumstances. You agree to not use Indeed Messaging to send bulk messages, unless specifically authorized in the Indeed interface. You agree to not circumvent this limitation through using your email service provider for this purpose, for example by sending email messages through your email service provider (e.g. your Gmail or third party email provider) to multiple Indeed aliased e-mail addresses. If a user, such as an Employer, sends an email to multiple recipients (e.g. by adding additional aliased email addresses to the cc field in a third party email client), this may affect the way messages on the Site are displayed. In this case, it is best to view the email conversation in the third party email client. Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you are communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias. You agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the content of any message or call from you or Employers. You further agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the manner in which you or Employers use Indeed Messaging or other communication options.
Indeed may offer you the opportunity to link a third-party email client to the Site for Indeed to scan your emails in your third-party email account and add job application updates to the “My jobs” page within your Indeed account. If you choose to use this feature, Indeed will automatically scan your emails and extract data that it identifies as being relevant to application statuses. The updates will not be limited to applications submitted on or through the Site, and will include applications submitted outside the Site as well. You agree to your extracted data being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Site’s rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service. Indeed does not guarantee that the updates to the job applications listed on the “My jobs” page within your Indeed account will be accurate or complete. You may turn off this feature at any time via your email settings.
Indeed may also insert functionality into messages relating to your application allowing you to place calls directly to third parties. Please note this functionality is provided solely as a courtesy. Your standard calling rates with your phone provider will apply.
Indeed may enable chatbots and other interactive experiences, which allow you to take certain actions on the Site, such as apply to a job, schedule an interview, or otherwise interact with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (“Chatbots”). You acknowledge and agree that Indeed collects, records, processes, analyzes, and stores any and all communications that you have with a Chatbot or other interactive features on the Site for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Site’s rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service. To achieve these purposes, we use this data to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Indeed uses vendors as an extension of the Site to collect, record, process, analyze, and store this data.
Chatbots are automated services that do not involve human interaction. Our Chatbots are also AI-Generated Content subject to our Beta Terms (see the “Other Services” section of our Terms of Service for All Users). For example, Indeed provides an AI interactive experience aimed at helping Job Seekers get personalized job recommendations and explore new career opportunities. Indeed uses data from your Indeed Profile and other data you choose to share with it to generate responses and suggestions. To the extent that AI-Generated Content contains personal information, it will be handled by Indeed in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy. Indeed does not act as an employment agency by providing such services.
It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information submitted through a Chatbot. Use of AI-Generated Content may in some situations result in incorrect output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You should evaluate the accuracy of any AI-Generated Content as appropriate. Indeed is not responsible for any loss, damage or inconvenience arising as a consequence of the use (or inability to use) a Chatbot, from the information you submit via a Chatbot, or from any outputs by a Chatbot.
Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify you that chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer. For example, you may see an option to chat with an Employer before applying to certain jobs. Whether or not you see that option depends on many factors, including whether the Employer turned on that functionality and the Employer and/ or Job Listing meet certain requirements. Indeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice.
If you have turned on browser push notifications and wish to turn them off, you may do so by visiting the settings on your browser. If you have turned on mobile push notifications and wish to turn them off, you may do so through your mobile device.
It is possible to create an Indeed account with a phone number only and no email address (“PNO Accounts”) in certain countries. If you create a PNO Account, you understand and agree that there are limitations to using such an account. Such limitations include the following: (i) if you forget your password, you may not be able to recover it or regain access to your PNO Account and the data contained in your PNO Account, (ii) if you change your phone number, you will lose access to your PNO Account if you do not change the phone number on your PNO Account before you lose access to your old number and (iii) you can only create a PNO Account if you have a WhatsApp account. If you forget your password, you may be given the option to regain access to your PNO Account in some limited circumstances (“Forgot Password Option”). If you want to proceed with the Forgot Password Option, you must ensure that you have access to the phone number associated with your PNO Account. If the phone number associated with your PNO Account has been recycled or a third party has access to it, there is a risk that a third party could access your PNO Account.
To unsubscribe at any time from non-transactional WhatsApp messages connected to your PNO Account, reply STOP by WhatsApp to the relevant message. DUE TO THE UNSTRUCTURED CONVERSATIONAL FORMAT OF THIS SERVICE, WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OTHER UNSUBSCRIBE ATTEMPTS. Please note that since PNO Accounts depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical issues on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to send or receive WhatsApp messages. You represent and warrant that you are the subscriber and primary user of the telephone number registered on your PNO Account. Indeed accepts no liability regarding phone numbers in PNO accounts being recycled or Job Seekers losing access to such phone numbers.
Short Code Text Messages
If you have consented to receiving text messages (i) about employer messages and upcoming interviews scheduled on the Site (“Employer Responses and Interview Updates”) or (ii) from Employers interested in Your Profile (“Recruiter Invites”), the terms in this paragraph apply to you. Employer Responses and Interview Updates may include employer messages, confirmation messages, messages reminding you about upcoming interviews and messages regarding interview cancellations. You can cancel the Employer Responses and Interview Updates and Recruiter Invites at any time by texting “STOP” to the relevant short code or by opting-out via Communication Settings. If you want to unsubscribe from both categories of messages you must text “STOP” to both short codes. After you send the text message “STOP”, we will send you a text message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive Employer Responses and Interview Updates or Recruiter Invites messages (as applicable). If you want to join again, sign up as you did the first time or opt-in via Communication Settings and we will start sending the relevant messages. Please note if you want to receive Recruiter Invites, your Resume must also be set to Searchable. If you are experiencing issues with the messaging program you can reply with the keyword “HELP” for more assistance, or you can visit our
Help Center
. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. Message and data rates may apply for (i) any messages sent by you to Indeed, and by Indeed to you and (ii) any calls to or from Indeed. Message frequency varies. If you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, it is best to contact your wireless provider.
6. Virtual Communications
Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in virtual, pre-recorded, and remote communications using Indeed products, including but not limited to, Indeed Interview, Indeed Hiring Platform, Virtual Evaluations, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”). You understand that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider and that Indeed is only providing the option for you to communicate with Employers via services that may be offered by third-party providers. Please note that since these telecommunication services may depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays or malfunctions on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive, transmit, or support such phone or video communications. Indeed does not guarantee any aspect of your Virtual Interview experience including transmission of phone or video communications, quality of audio/visual content, data security, or data usage and restrictions.
Indeed is not liable for any claims arising out of your use of Virtual Interviews and you release Indeed from any such claims.
You understand that Indeed does not guarantee the Employer’s schedule or availability for conducting Virtual Interviews and cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us. You also understand that the Employer is responsible for any and all questions, comments, or hiring decisions made. Further, Employers are responsible for any accommodations you need during Virtual Interviews.
NOTICE – Virtual Interviews May be Recorded: You understand that an Employer may enable the recording of a Virtual Interview or you may be given the option to pre-record an interview to provide to the Employer. You agree to respect any notification (visual, audio, or otherwise) which may indicate that recording is enabled by or on behalf of an Employer on Virtual Interview. If you do not agree to be recorded, you must refrain from pre-recording an interview or you must immediately leave the Virtual Interview. By using Virtual Interviews, you agree that the Virtual Interview may be recorded and that Indeed and third party providers can store, access and analyze the recording.  Also, you agree that an Employer that receives pre-recorded interviews or activates the recording function, can access, store, use, analyze, and share the recording, and that this activity is outside of Indeed’s control. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT INDEED IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE RECORDING OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS, AND YOU RELEASE INDEED FROM ANY SUCH CLAIMS.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE OR DATA THAT YOU TRANSMIT WHILE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT, INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, OR YOUR IMAGE OR LIKENESS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, INDEED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OR PROTECTING ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT DURING YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. INDEED ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR THE MISUSE OF ANY DATA YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT THROUGH USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INDEED DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR AVAILABILITY OR RETENTION OF ANY RECORDINGS OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
7. Screening Tools
Indeed may make screening tools available to Employers for Employer use in the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and assessments. Indeed is licensing these tools for Employers’ use as determined by Employers. As a Job Seeker you agree that the Employer has made the determination to use these tools as part of its application process, and the questions asked are solely determined by the Employer, and are not being asked by Indeed. The Employer is the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate and is solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact”.
Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering screening tools. By using screening tools, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers. Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Job Seekers to exchange information as they determine. The sole responsibility for the content of any screening tools, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of screening tools, is solely with Employers or Job Seekers as applicable.
You further acknowledge that only the Employer is responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law. While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, each disability is unique and Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.
8. Career Services
Indeed may offer you resume review, resume scan, offer coaching, live video consulting sessions, writing services, general career guidance, or other consultation services (collectively, “Career Services”). By using Career Services, you request that Indeed, or an Indeed vendor, provide you with the service you select according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy. You may only use Career Services for advice concerning your own resume, offer, or employment situation and not another person’s.  As a user of the Site, Indeed may also, from time to time, provide you career or hiring guides via blog posts, email, chatbots, AI-Generated Content, or other channels as part of its services to you. For example, Indeed may provide tips on improving your resume or how to use your resume effectively in the job application process, commonly asked interview questions, next steps after you have submitted an application, how to prepare for a new job after you have been hired, or assist you with exploring new career opportunities. Indeed offers these Career Services as optional guidelines for its users and all liability with respect to actions taken or not taken based on the contents of such Career Services are hereby expressly disclaimed.
When filling out forms associated with Career Services, you agree to provide complete and accurate information. Any information you upload through the forms, including a resume, constitutes User Content and shall be treated in accordance with any User Content sections herein. Any career-related or hiring-related information, feedback, guides, AI-Generated Content, or other content provided by Indeed, or Indeed’s vendors, through Career Services or otherwise, is for informational purposes only, and is in no way to be construed as professional career counseling or staffing services (unless otherwise expressly noted by Indeed in services such as Indeed Agent in Japan). You understand that Indeed may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search. You further understand that in providing any such career or hiring guides, Indeed is not acting as a job placement agency or staffing firm (unless otherwise expressly noted by Indeed in services such as Indeed Agent in Japan). You are responsible for reviewing any career or hiring-related information provided to you, for example, for accuracy and completeness. You are also responsible for editing the information before you use it, for example, for an employment application. Indeed is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information that Indeed or its vendor provides you.  You understand that by using Career Services or referring to or using any career or hiring information, you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement, assurance of being hired, or a higher salary or increased benefit,  and you take full responsibility for use of these services or information.
Indeed owns all rights in Career Services and other career and hiring-related material that Indeed provides you, such as video feedback and hiring tips. By using Career Services, Indeed grants you an express, non-exclusive, non-assignable, and non-sublicensable right and license to use materials developed by Indeed or Indeed vendors for you. This license is limited to personal and non-commercial use and any further use is prohibited.
Indeed may offer, as part of Career Services, the opportunity for you to engage with third parties, sometimes referred to as career coaches or professional writers, to discuss job search, resume writing, or career strategies, either through the Site or in person. Regardless of how you interact with them, you acknowledge that these third parties are not employees of Indeed and that Indeed is not responsible for the content of any such discussion or any actions taken or not taken based on the contents of such discussion. Do not share any information you consider confidential or personally sensitive with these third parties. Indeed does not guarantee the quality or effectiveness of any advice, recommendations, or guidance you may receive from these third parties. You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Indeed will have no liability arising from any discussion you have with such a third party. Further, the live video service functionality in Career Services utilizes a video platform created by the third party, Whereby. By using any feature of Career Services that involves live video services, you agree to Whereby’s
privacy policy
.
Career Services Payment, Cancellation, and Termination
. To the extent that you use a paid Career Services offering, you shall be charged as indicated on the Site. Subject to the limited cancellation rights described below, refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form Indeed finds appropriate in its sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card, bank account, and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors.
Consumer’s Right to Cancel
The following cancellation provision is applicable only to Job Seekers who are residents of British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and who have purchased a Career Services offering:
You may cancel your purchase of Career Services from the day you enter into the contract until ten (10) days after you receive the services. You do not need a reason to cancel. If you do not receive the services within thirty (30) days of the date stated in the contract, you may cancel the contract within one (1) year of the contract date. Any acceptance of delivery beyond the thirty (30) day threshold forfeits such rights. You lose that right if you accept delivery after the 30 days. There are other grounds for extended cancellation. For more information, you may contact your provincial consumer affairs office. If you cancel your purchase of Career Services, Indeed shall have fifteen (15) days to refund your money. To cancel, please contact Indeed, Inc. at career-services@indeed.com.
Termination
Indeed may cancel all or part of Career Services or we may suspend your access to Career Services at our sole discretion, at any time, with or without prior notice. If you wish to terminate your use of Career Services, you may do so at any time. Indeed may also, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer Career Services to anyone, without providing a reason.
9. Salary and Other Information Provided by Indeed
Indeed may provide salary and other information and content to users for informational purposes only. For example, Indeed may provide you with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, number of applies to a Job Listing, responses to certain screener questions for a Job Listing, or the likelihood that a particular event will occur such as being selected for an interview. This information provided by Indeed is based on estimates given for informational purposes only and without warranty, and is subject to change or varying levels of accuracy. Please note that all salary figures displayed on the Site are approximations based on different criteria, including AI-Generated Content or multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates. These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only. Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, “Responsive Employer” or “Active Employer” or “Hired on Indeed” or “Verified”. Employers may also request that Indeed add such labels. Indeed shall determine the method by which such labels or badges are determined or which Employers qualify. The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies. Some of the data may be provided by the Employer and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such data. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge that is added to Employer names or Job Ads. Indeed may add labels or badges to Job Ads – such as pay types, specialties, benefits, or union associations – based on data contained within the job description for informational purposes only. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge that is added to Employer names or Job Ads, including data on Job Ads.
Indeed may also display publicly available information about employers on Company Pages. Information on Company Pages is presented for informational and promotional purposes only, is subject to change, and may be gathered from or generated by third parties. Please contact the Employer for the most accurate and up-to-date company information.
10. Your Job Seeker Data
As a Job Seeker, you take a variety of actions on our Site and you provide various information. For example, you search for jobs, and Indeed knows and stores the titles of jobs you search for and click on, where those jobs are located, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (if indicated on the Job Listings), the Job Listings you apply to, your amount of activity or time of most recent activity on the Site, and any other information you provide directly to Indeed including desired salary, past experience, any information in your Indeed Profile, and any of your other behavior on the Site. You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who provided the information or undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity. By using the Site, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed collects, records, processes, analyzes, and stores any and all information you provide and activities you take on the Site, and any and all interactions and communications you have with, on, or through the Site. You further acknowledge and agree that Indeed may inform the Employer about activities you take on the Site or your use of the Site, for example, whether you are online, recently active, or active on Indeed, and whether you are responsive to Employer messages on Indeed.
When you initiate a job application on a website operated by an Employer or its applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as via API, cookies, pixels and web beacons. The information collected includes, for example, information about Job Listings you viewed and job applications you started and completed. An Employer who provides tracker functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law. However, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no control over such an Employer or its website. You agree to Indeed’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such tracker functionality.
You agree that any data contained in or associated with Your Profile may be used to suggest jobs to you and to suggest you or your Profile to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on the Site.  You also agree that Indeed may contact you based on this observed behavior or provided info on behalf of Employers or Indeed itself. Please note, the aforementioned actions do not include information sent to you by a third party, however, Indeed may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Indeed Site to correspond with a third party. In addition, if Your Profile is set to Searchable, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with third-party Employers. If you do not wish to share such information, you may set Your Profile to Not Searchable. When you make changes to your Indeed Profile, including, but not limited to, updating, deleting, or changing settings, it may take a few days for the changes to be reflected.
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Job Seeker profiles, such as “Responsive Candidate” or “New Applicant.”  Indeed determines the method by which such labels or badges are added or which Job Seekers qualify based solely on Job Seeker activity on Indeed. The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if a Job Seeker qualifies. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge, and reserves the right to change or remove such label or badge features at any time and in Indeed’s sole discretion.
You may have the opportunity to provide Indeed with certain demographic information about yourself, such as your race and ethnicity, gender, age, LGBTQ+ community membership, and disability status, as well as whether you have an arrest or conviction record (“demographic data”). By choosing to provide your demographic data you agree that Indeed may use it to evaluate and improve our products, and share aggregate summaries of job seeker information with employers. If you do not want your demographic data to be used in this way, do not provide it to Indeed (or, if you have already provided your demographic data to Indeed, you can request it be removed). You further acknowledge and agree that another Job Seeker’s demographic data is personal information, and to the extent permitted by law you waive any right to request or view demographic data pertaining to any other Job Seeker.
Please note that Indeed may be required to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. This means, for example, that Indeed may receive legal process from courts or law enforcement to reveal user data, including demographic data.
Please also note that some Employers may ask applicants to voluntarily self-identify certain demographic information such as race, ethnicity, sex, disability and/or veteran status along with their job applications. Some Employers are required by law to ask these questions and you may see these questions when applying to jobs on Indeed. That is a separate process from Indeed’s collection of demographic data, and Indeed is not responsible for these questions. If you have questions or concerns about an Employer’s application materials, please contact the Employer directly or refer to their privacy policy.
11. Indeed Hiring Platform
Indeed Hiring Platform is a platform designed to streamline Employer hiring and employment decision- making processes by allowing users access to various products such as Indeed Interview and related services (“Indeed Hiring Platform”). Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in hiring activities that might be supported by Indeed Hiring Platform. You acknowledge and understand that Employers select the method and manner that Indeed Hiring Platform will be used for its job openings and that the Employer determines the job requirements and specific needs of its hiring efforts. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT EMPLOYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE LAW REGARDING ITS EMPLOYMENT AND HIRING PRACTICES, INCLUDING TITLE VII, AND THAT EMPLOYER INDEMNIFIES INDEED AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM EMPLOYER’S USE OF INDEED HIRING PLATFORM OR SIMILAR PRODUCTS. INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT EMPLOYER’S USE OF THE SERVICES COMPLIES WITH TITLE VII OR ANY SIMILAR LAW. Indeed has no control nor participates in the hiring or decision-making process regarding Employer hiring efforts. Further, you understand that Indeed is not an employment agency by offering Indeed Hiring Platform and related tools. By using Indeed Hiring Platform, you understand that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employer or opportunities for Job Seekers. Indeed merely provides Indeed Hiring platform as a tool that enables Employers and Job Seekers to exchange information as they determine.
12. Indeed Hire
Indeed Hire provides recruitment services to its clients. When you apply to a job supported by Indeed Hire, or otherwise engage with Indeed Hire as a Job Seeker, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed Hire may use the Site and its tools as an agent to Employers, such as Indeed Apply, Virtual Interviews, and other screening tools. You further agree that Indeed Hire may use information you provide to Indeed Hire and data collected through the Site to present potential job matches to you and to potential Employers.
Employers retaining Indeed Hire are solely responsible for determining their job requirements, the specific needs of their hiring efforts, and their hiring decisions. By engaging with Indeed Hire, you understand that you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement, suitability for a particular position, or assurance of being hired, and you take full responsibility for your own decisions and actions during the recruitment process, including the acceptance or rejection of job offers.

The application of mandatory provisions limiting the choice of law and in particular the application of mandatory laws of the country in which you have your habitual residence, such as consumer protection laws, shall remain unaffected.
You also hereby waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to your use of the Site or these terms of service, if you are located in the United States.

B. Terms of Service for Employers
The following terms and conditions apply to all Employers and other users who access or use the Site as intended for individuals and/or organizations seeking to make available information regarding employment openings, on their behalf or other’s behalf, including but not limited to agencies purchasing for multiple parties, or otherwise indicate their acceptance to this Agreement. You further agree that the
Terms of Service for All Users
also apply. For the avoidance of doubt where the Terms of Service for All Users overlap or conflict with the Terms of Service for Employers, you agree that the Terms of Service for Employers will govern.
For purposes of this Section B of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as an Employer or other user as described above.
1. Employer Accounts
When you create an Indeed account, a Company Page or post job listings advertising employment opportunities and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”) on the Site, whether as part of the Indeed Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement (including the
Data Processing Agreement
), the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using, and all of Indeed’s policies, including the
Indeed Privacy Policy
and
Cookie Policy
, apply to you.
When you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity. You may be presented with different options for verification, including verification via a third party service such as ID.me or Persona (“Third Party Verification Services”). When using Third Party Verification Services, you will be providing your information to our Third Party Verification Services, and engaging with them directly. You agree that ID.me is solely responsible for any collection, use, storage, processing, or loss of data you provide to them, and any legal obligations related to such activities, including the capture or storage of any biometric identification or biometric identifiers. You also agree that Persona is responsible for any collection, use, storage, processing, or loss of data you provide to them, and any legal obligations related to such activities, including the capture or storage of any biometric identification or biometric identifiers. Indeed does not collect any biometric information or biometric identifiers, or receive any biometric information or biometric identifiers from the Third Party Verification Services.
When you access or use the Site in your capacity as an employee or other representative of an Employer, or if you create an Indeed account on behalf of an Employer, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Employer to this Agreement. When you create an account on behalf of an Employer, the account belongs to the Employer, and you acknowledge that any and all information that you provide Indeed through the account, such as the actions you take and when you take them, will be visible to the Employer. As part of this account you may have an individual profile (“Employer Profile”). Your Employer Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Account Settings” and “Employer Settings” section of the account.
As an Employer, your account is for business use and not for personal use. Indeed is not responsible for and disclaims all liability if your email is used improperly or falsely by a third party. By registering for an Indeed account, you agree to receive mandatory email updates regarding account activity to your Indeed account. If you attempt to send an email from a name or email address that is not true, accurate, current or complete, we reserve the right to drop such email, and attempting to send such email is a violation of our terms. Employers may request that Indeed disable an account at any time by contacting the
Employer Help Center
. Please note that Indeed may be required to preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law. Alternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in the “Your Personal data rights” section of this
Privacy Policy
.
In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (“a Linked Account”). A Linked Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (“Admins”) of an Employer account invites other users to the same account. Admin(s) and other designated users can provide these other users varying levels of access and functionality (“Roles”) within the account, as described on the site, such as accessing account data, including candidate Personal Data, contained in the account of the user who initiated the invite, or purchasing services from Indeed under such account. If you are an Admin or another designated user adding a user to a Role or several Roles, you represent to Indeed that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have the authority to allow this data and access to be shared. You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Indeed from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs) that result from the sharing of this data, access to your account, and any purchases made under your account. When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may have access to any or all account information, such as: communications and actions of all other users and applicants within the Linked Account, resume contacts, and billing information, and you consent to such access. When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may also have the ability to purchase Indeed products under your account, and you agree that you are responsible for the payment of all such purchases made. If you accept another user’s invitation to link your Employer account to their Employer account, you acknowledge that any and all information about your activity in your Employer account, such as the actions you take and when you take them, will be visible to all linked users. Administrators of Linked Accounts may retain certain information Linked Account users provide, such as an email address used to receive applications. Linked Account users will not be able to see your activity, such as your job searches, applications or preferences or your Indeed Profile information, contained in your Job Seeker account.  You may visit your account settings at any time to unlink your account.  The Admin assigned to an Employer account may also unlink any user from that Employer account at any time, and may be notified if your Linked Account is used to login from too many devices.
If your Indeed employer account has a credit card or other payment method on file, such as bank account information for Automatic Clearing House (“ACH”) payment, Indeed may charge that payment method for any products or services you order and for any outstanding payments, including to correct billing errors.
You agree that Indeed may send notices to Job Seekers informing them that an Employer account has been compromised, including if such account is associated with you. Indeed cannot and does not guarantee that such notices will always be sent or received, and you therefore agree that Indeed bears no responsibility for doing so. Indeed makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices.
Indeed may offer suggestions, recommendations, or information to users that may support or improve their experience on Indeed Sites. You understand that these offerings are provided as a courtesy and without warranty, and your use of such information is at your sole discretion. As an Employer, you are responsible for your use of the Site and any tools offered therein, including your decisions regarding your job description, the requirements for your job, compliance with applicable laws, including relevant federal, state, and local laws related to job postings, and whom you interview or hire. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any actions you take based on any information provided by Indeed. Indeed may limit your ability to post a job, or the visibility of your job, if it does not appear to indicate a salary above minimum wage, wage transparency laws, or does not comply with other applicable law; however Indeed is not responsible for, and you are solely responsible for, compliance with minimum wage, local language and other legal requirements.
If you are an Indeed agency partner, you may be eligible to participate in an Indeed partnership program. Agency partners in this program may attain the rank of “Gold”, “Silver”, or “Bronze” based on their Indeed usage and engagement, measured by revenue. Indeed’s determination of an agency’s rank is made at Indeed’s full discretion and may be revoked at any time.
Indeed may offer you the ability to delete candidate and application information stored in your candidate dashboard. If you delete this candidate and application information, you acknowledge that you will no longer be able to access it through Indeed and that the deletion cannot be undone. You agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing employment records, job application materials or data on your behalf, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements or other applicable law.
2. Employer Services Including Indeed Apply and Screener Questions
You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Indeed may activate its Indeed Apply relay function for use in connection with your Job Listings, and that any Job Seeker may indicate interest in Job Listings through Indeed Apply, and that Indeed will send applications to the email address you provide. You also agree that Indeed may activate a chatbot, which enables Job Seekers to apply to your Job Ad by answering questions. The answers a Job Seeker submits are presented to you as a job application. When you use Indeed candidate management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may make available functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate. You agree that if you use such candidate management tools, Indeed may assemble the candidate’s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, and other information the candidate provides to Indeed into one document or webpage. You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention, reporting requirements or other applicable law. By using these tools any information shared through the Site will be processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Indeed may store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled. Candidate Summaries may be provided by Indeed for certain Job Seekers in the Candidate Details page. These Summaries are populated with information from the Job Seeker and information provided by you in the Job Description. Candidate Summaries are not a recommendation for employment. Employers agree to review the full application and not to use such summaries as the basis for employment decisions.
In a Candidate Summary or other product or service on the Site, you may see a verification of a Job Seeker’s skills, certifications, or other qualifications.  Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such verifications or information, and you are solely responsible for verifying information on the Site.
Whether you are using the Site directly or any ATS you are responsible for the contents of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, criteria you set for inviting candidates to interview, Company Pages that you create, update, or manage, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Indeed Apply or otherwise, and agree that Indeed is not responsible for such content and disclaims all liability for such content, including as to whether such content is legal. You agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with applicable law for all content on the Site, including minimum wage requirements, wage transparency laws, or any other law. If you include voluntary self-identification questions for Job Seekers along with your application materials, you are solely responsible for compliance with applicable laws related to such questions, including the content and format of the questions and your use of the Job Seekers’ responses. You are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements related to collecting and reporting demographic information about applicants.
If you close or change any Job Listings that you post, you agree to promptly update such Job Listings on the Site or otherwise notify Indeed.  Indeed may provide you with a mechanism for responding to requests for accommodations from Job Seekers.
You are responsible for ensuring that your selection criteria are job-related, that you do not pose “disability-related inquiries” or medical inquiries in violation of the law, and that you do not screen out people with disabilities or members of any protected category under the law. You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law. You are responsible for clearly indicating that reasonable accommodations are available, engaging with and responding to any requests for accommodation, and providing information about how to request an accommodation to Job Seekers.
You agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason. For example, Indeed may remove any Job Listing or question that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers. Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing, requirement, or question specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability. Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing, requirement, or question implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing, requirement, or question that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers or otherwise violates applicable law.
You understand and agree that you are responsible for ensuring that your Job Listing requirements and criteria are job-related and in compliance with applicable law.
Indeed does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. You are solely responsible for checking your Employer dashboard to view job applications and other information. Any notifications, such as emails, you may receive about applications or other activities, are provided solely as a courtesy to you and you should not rely on them.
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable. If you do not feel comfortable sending a message, such as an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Indeed’s relay functions, do not use the Indeed relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via another method. When using the Indeed Apply function, Indeed will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Indeed by you, however, Indeed has no ability to verify the contact information provided by you. In the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Indeed for any damages resulting therefrom.
Should you post any Job Listings for Job Seekers in any country (including but not limited to Japan) where the cross-border transfer of personal data is regulated (such as requiring user consent), you warrant and agree that you will not cause or allow a cross-border transfer of personal data from the Site to you that violates or is contrary to the applicable data protection laws. For example, you will take such actions to ensure that any resultant job applications and other personal data to be sent or directed to your designated contact information (including an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or other service provider selected by you) either through Indeed Apply or other relay functions shall be accessed or received by you at your business location in such country.
When Job Seekers apply or RSVP to your Job Listing, Indeed may give them the opportunity to provide certain demographic information to Indeed, such as race and ethnicity, gender, age, LGBTQ+ community membership, and disability status, as well as whether they have an arrest or conviction record (“demographic data”). This Indeed demographic data survey is separate from any voluntary self-identification questions provided by Employers. By using the Program, you agree that Indeed may collect demographic data from Job Seekers applying to your Job Listing using Indeed’s demographic survey, and that Indeed may use information from that survey to evaluate and improve our products. You further agree that you as an Employer have no ability, right, or entitlement to view or access demographic data collected via the Indeed demographic data survey pertaining to any Job Seeker or related to any employer by any means including civil discovery, subpoena, or any other legal process without their permission. You agree you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable nondiscrimination laws. Indeed disclaims any warranty regarding the demographic composition of Job Seekers applying to any particular job.
When you use Indeed Apply for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may add functions into the corresponding Indeed Apply emails. In addition, Indeed may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview. Indeed may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume. When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction. If you choose such option, such candidates will receive rejection notices and will be set to rejected in your candidate dashboard. You further acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately. When you use Indeed’s candidate management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to candidates whose status you set to “rejected.” If you choose such option, you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices.
Similarly, you may be given the option to use candidate management tools that schedule interviews on your behalf with Job Seekers who meet criteria you have selected. If you choose such option, Job Seekers will be scheduled for interviews and invited to interviews on your behalf via email based on whether information the Job Seeker has provided to Indeed (e.g., answers to screener questions, resume) matches criteria you have set.
You are responsible for ensuring that your selection criteria are job-related, that you do not pose “disability-related inquiries” or medical inquiries in violation of the law, and that you do not screen out people with disabilities or members of any protected category under the law. You are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law.
You further agree that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these interview invitations (which are purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the information the Job Seeker provided to Indeed may not be accurate. Indeed may request that Job Seekers confirm their interest in the position before scheduling an interview. It is ultimately the Employer’s responsibility to confirm whether any interviews were scheduled, or to reschedule or cancel interviews if necessary. The decision of who to interview is decided solely by the Employer, who can choose to interview any Job Seeker at any time, and by scheduling such interviews, Indeed does not warrant that a Job Seeker is qualified, meets the criteria the Employer has set, or that the information provided by the Job Seeker to Indeed is accurate. Indeed candidate management tools are intended to allow Employers to more efficiently connect with Job Seekers as they determine, and the sole responsibility for the content of any screener question, any decision to proceed or not proceed with interview or offers, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of candidate management tools is solely with the Employer. By using this and other candidate management tools, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers, and that Indeed does not act as your employment agency by offering these candidate management tools.
Indeed may highlight to Job Seekers qualifications required for your position in order to help the Job Seekers assess whether to apply for your role. Indeed does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Indeed know a Job Seeker’s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker’s qualifications or interest in your job listing. You agree that Indeed Apply and Indeed’s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are your and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.
By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions. You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed. You also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions. This includes Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Indeed’s Privacy Policy, as well as Indeed providing the recording to third parties to aid in analysis or quality of the product. Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such phone screens and responses, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Company Page created or claimed by you, or any Job Listing, application materials, voluntary self-identification questions, or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you. Indeed may make Job Ad analytics data available on a Company Page or elsewhere on the Site, and may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Indeed’s discretion. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product as set out in the IO for that product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance. Indeed may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per the maximum interest permitted by law and (ii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting such late payments.
When you view, send, take action on, make a decision regarding, store, or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, applications, pre-recorded interviews, and messages) through or using the Site or any Applicant Tracking System (“ATS”), Indeed may, for any purpose, use any data of such materials or action for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other Job Listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise. Indeed may also inform the Job Seeker of your  actions or activity related to such materials through or using the Site or any ATS.  For example, Indeed may notify the Job Seeker about your activity or action related to a Job Ad (such as pausing or closing it), or Job Seeker’s application or Resume (for example, that you viewed or responded to it, or that you made a decision with respect to it). Indeed may inform Job Seekers about activities you take on the Site, for example, whether you are online, recently active, or active on the Site. You hereby consent to Indeed informing the Job Seeker about such actions and activities.
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, “Responsive Employer” or “Active Employer” or “Hired on Indeed” or “Verified”. Employers may also request that Indeed add such labels. Indeed, in its sole discretion, may also add explanatory content to Job Ads, which may be AI-Generated Content (as defined below), about an Employer’s likelihood to respond to a particular Job Seeker. Indeed shall determine the method by which such labels, badges, or explanatory content are added or which Employers qualify. The lack of a label, badge, or explanatory content may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies or if the explanatory content would apply. Some of the data may be provided by the Employer and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such data. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label, badge, or explanatory content that is added to Employer names or Job Ads. Indeed reserves the right to change or remove such label, badge, or explanatory content features at any time and in Indeed’s sole discretion.
If you access or use any Indeed Application Programming Interface (API), including accessing and using the Site or any of the Indeed Apps or any Applicant Tracking System (ATS) through an API, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, the
Indeed API Terms
,
Indeed Privacy Policy
, the Site Rules, and any additional rules and policies made available by Indeed. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE ANY API AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF ANY INDEED API.
It is your responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App or the Site for the most up-to-date information (including, but not limited to, explanations about how features work, disclaimers and disclosures regarding the services provided, method for charging) about Indeed’s products and services. By using an API, rather than directly using the Site or an Indeed App, you agree to all information provided on the Site or an Indeed App. Use of an Application or ATS via an API, rather than direct use of the Site or an Indeed App, shall not excuse any lack of information or understanding about Indeed’s products and services where that information is otherwise provided on the Site or an Indeed App.
Your use of a third party developer to build an integration with an ATS:
Should you appoint or otherwise utilize a third party developer to develop an integration with an ATS , you shall ensure that you and the third party developer comply with all applicable Data Protection laws (including, inter alia, the execution of data processing agreements) in the development of the ATS integration. When you use the Indeed API through a third party developer to develop an integration with an ATS you shall be fully liable for the actions / omissions of the third party developer and the ATS you choose to use. You shall also ensure that all personal data (including disposition data) transferred to Indeed via the integration takes place in compliance with applicable Data Protection laws, for example, obtaining consents from and providing notices to data subjects (as applicable) as well as implementing relevant agreements where required by such laws. You shall indemnify and hold harmless Indeed against any claim or actions brought by a data subject arising from or related to Your use of the API and/or your use of a third party developer and their use of the API.
You acknowledge that as part of its efforts to combat fraud and spam, Indeed may require that users verify their email address, including Job Seekers applying to your job. However, email verification is not guaranteed. You are responsible for your use of any software that rejects applications from unverified email addresses.
Indeed may offer functionality permitting you to request demographic information, including disability status, from applicants to your Job Ad. If you use such functionality, you represent that you are a federal contractor or subcontractor who is required to seek disability status information from job applicants for the purpose of complying with the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“OFCCP”) requirements. You acknowledge that this functionality is presented without warranty, and compliance with any OFCCP or other governmental record-keeping requirements remains your sole responsibility.
3. Job Match
Job matches are recommendations which may be presented to both you as an Employer and to Job Seekers in various formats on the Site. For example, Indeed may recommend Resumes which match Job Ads you have posted, or recommend Job Ads to Job Seekers which are similar to jobs to which they have recently applied. Job matching is provided to you on a beta basis and is subject to our Beta Program (see section 9 of the Terms of Service for All Users).
To generate matches, Indeed uses data collected through our Site from both Employers and Job Seekers. This includes Job Ads, Resume, application materials (including responses to screener questions), and user activity on the Site (such as searches run and Job Ads clicked on and applied to). Indeed may use this information to present potential matches to you and to potential Job Seekers. Indeed’s matches uses the ESCO classification of the European Commission.
4. Salary, Applies or Other Information Provided by Indeed
Indeed may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only. For example, Indeed may provide Job Seekers with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, number of applies to a Job Listing, responses to certain screener questions for a Job listing, or provide you with estimated applies to your Job Listing. All such figures provided by Indeed are estimates given for informational purposes only, may come from AI-Generated Content or a third party, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy. If you are participating in the Indeed Ads Program and your Sponsored Job advertising budget is set on a per-apply basis, you will be charged based on Indeed’s determination of Apply count as reflected in your employer dashboard and not based on the number of applies that may be provided to Job Seekers for informational purposes only. Indeed may add labels or badges to Job Ads – such as pay types, specialties, benefits, or union associations – based on data contained within the job description. These are for informational purposes only and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge. Indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site.
Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates. These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only. Indeed may also provide data regarding impressions in relation to your Job Ad. Such figures are provided for informational purposes only, are subject to change at any time, and Indeed does not guarantee their accuracy. Indeed reserves the right to change the method of measuring such figures at any time.
Indeed may offer job post templates for informational purposes only. By using any of this content, you adopt it as your own and are responsible for making it true, appropriate and compliant with all applicable laws. All content provided by Indeed, including template job post information and estimated applications for a given job posting, is for informational purposes only, may comprise or be based on information provided by third parties, is provided without warranty, and is subject to change and varying levels of accuracy. Estimated applications are not a guarantee of future performance.
Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Job Seeker profiles, such as “Responsive Candidate” or “New Applicant.”  Indeed determines the method by which such labels or badges are added or which Job Seekers qualify based solely on Job Seeker activity on Indeed. The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if a Job Seeker qualifies. Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of any label or badge, and reserves the right to change or remove such label or badge features at any time and in Indeed’s sole discretion.
5. Screening Tools
Indeed may make available to you screening tools for your use for candidates who apply to your job, including screener questions, and phone screen tools. Indeed is licensing these tools to you for your use as you determine. By using any screening product, made available to you by Indeed, you agree that you have made the determination to use these tools as part of your application process, and the substantive questions you ask or choose are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed. You agree you are solely responsible for the use of such screening tools in compliance with the law, such as: the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state statutes; applicable employment, equality or anti-discrimination laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other similar federal, state, and local laws; and any applicable data protection or privacy laws, or laws regulating use of “automated employment decision tools”.
You are responsible for ensuring that your selection criteria are job-related, that you do not pose “disability-related inquiries” or medical inquiries in violation of the law, and that you do not screen out people with disabilities or members of any protected category under the law. You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law. You are responsible for clearly indicating that reasonable accommodations are available, engaging with and responding to any requests for accommodation, and providing information about how to request an accommodation to Job Seekers
. Indeed shall direct Job Seekers who reach out to Indeed with an accommodation request to you via the contact information you provided to Indeed, and you are responsible for monitoring your inbox for such requests.While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, each disability is unique and Indeed does not warrant compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law. You agree to indemnify Indeed for any and all claims arising out of your use of a screening tool, including any claims that any screening tool does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar law, or that your use of any screening tool results in a “disparate impact.”
Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist. Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application. To prevent a rejection notice from being sent, you must indicate your interest in the application on the Site. Any interactions you have directly with a Job Seeker and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing a Job Seeker directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and will not prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent. If you activate Employer Assist then you must interact with a Job Seeker through a tool provided by Indeed to prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent. If you activate Employer Assist, candidates with whom you do not interact within your chosen time frame will receive rejection notices, and you agree to indemnify Indeed from any claims arising therefrom. You further agree that Indeed may notify Job Seekers about the estimated time frame during which they may expect to hear back from you based on the time frame you choose in Employer Assist.
Indeed may offer functionality that groups candidates based on whether they meet or may meet Employers’ criteria, based on text in their resumes or answers to screener questions, and we offer Employers the ability to automatically schedule calls with applicants who meet their criteria as well. In all cases, Employers can view any applicant at any time, and Indeed makes no decisions about any applicant.
You agree that such functionality does not constitute or contribute to a decision, and is not a substitute for human discretion and review. You agree not to use such functionality as the sole factor, as a factor weighted more than other factors, or to modify or overrule conclusions derived from other factors, in your decision-making or hiring processes.
6. Communication through the Site
You may receive notifications via the app, email, SMS or your Indeed dashboard corresponding with your activity or use or a Job Seeker’s activity on or use of the Site, Indeed Apply, Indeed Messaging, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site. In all cases, such notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them. For example, if you wish to interview a Job Seeker, it is your responsibility to follow up with the Job Seeker separately to ensure they know about the interview, do not rely on notifications through the Site. Further, if you post a Job Listing directly on the Site, applications are sent to your Indeed dashboard; any other notifications you may receive are provided solely as a courtesy to you. For example, you may not receive application email notifications if a Job Seeker has not answered screener questions correctly, although these applications will be sent to your Indeed dashboard.  Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
Indeed may enable Indeed Messaging, as well as text messaging relay, email relay, and/or call relay services through our Site directly or through vendors to help facilitate contact between Employers and Job Seekers about a Job Listing. Indeed may also enable Employers and/or Job Seekers to connect with each other on Indeed Messaging via third-party providers. Job Seekers may be notified of messages you send on Indeed Messaging by multiple mechanisms, including within the app, email, or SMS, depending on the Job Seeker’s choice and our discretion. You understand that communicating through such Indeed Messaging and/or other communication options on or through the Site shall be limited to the purpose of hiring for a Job Listing. Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable Indeed Messaging and/or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify Job Seekers that Indeed Messaging or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer. For example, you may be eligible to enable Indeed Messaging pre-apply to certain Job Listings. To remain eligible for Indeed Messaging pre-apply, you must respond to Job Seeker communication in the amount of time identified on the Site. Indeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Indeed Messaging for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice and for any or no reason. Please note that since messaging relay services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays and other errors on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to send or receive communications, such as text messages, emails or calls.  We also do not guarantee that Indeed’s integrations with these third-party providers or interface will be error-free. Further, we do not guarantee that communications sent to or through Indeed Messaging will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.  In the event a message  being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
Indeed may mask or hide contact information, such as phone numbers and email addresses, and substitute it with an alias. For example, Indeed may mask Job Seeker contact information from resumes or applications. Indeed may also mask your email address or phone number, and Job Seekers may see an alias email address or phone number when they communicate with you. You agree to a Job Seeker contacting you from a masked phone number or email. If you contact a Job Seeker from a masked phone number and you do not leave your contact information, after the masked number expires, the Job Seeker may not be able to contact you by phone unless you have provided your actual contact information to them. Once a Job Seeker has your contact info, you agree that Indeed is not responsible or liable for the manner in which they may use the info.
When you or a Job Seeker send a message to an Indeed provided alias, Indeed and its vendors will process the message to offer you services, display your message on the Site, and for other purposes as provided in this Agreement. For example, when you send or receive a message to an Indeed alias via email, Indeed will decide how and what to extract on Indeed Messaging. Some messages related to the same conversation may not be grouped together.  Indeed may group messages together as part of a conversation on Indeed Messaging. This is done as a courtesy, and some messages related to the same conversation may not be grouped together. When communicating with a Job Seeker through the Site, the Employer sender’s information and any other conversation participant’s information’ may be displayed in different ways depending on the platform (browser or mobile) and whether the participant has an Indeed account. For example, it may be displayed as their Indeed account user name or company name, “Employer” or “Employee #”, “Guest (added from email)”, or as the email account sender display name of the person sending the message, if available, but you or the Job Seeker may not see all that info in all circumstances.
Indeed’s messaging system is not intended for sending one message to multiple Job Seekers. You agree to not use Indeed’s messaging services to send bulk messages, unless specifically authorized in the Indeed interface.
You agree to not circumvent this limitation through using your email client for this purpose, for example by sending email messages through your email client (e.g. your Gmail or third party email provider) to multiple Indeed aliased email addresses.
You agree that any email that you address to more than one Job Seeker on the To, CC, or BCC line is separated into different emails and conversations by Job Seeker; you will see Job Seeker responses in their own email threads and their own conversations on Indeed Messaging. If a user sends an email to multiple recipients (e.g. by adding additional aliased email addresses to the cc field in a third party email client), this may affect the way messages on the Site are displayed. In this case, it is best to view the email conversation in the third party email client. Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you’re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias.
If you, or anyone on your behalf, , view, store, send or receive communication or materials, (including messages, text messages, chats, emails, interview or other voice recordings or transcripts, and any other information) to, on or through the Site, you agree to the communication or material being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.  To achieve these purposes, we use this data  to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Indeed also uses vendors as an extension of the Site to collect, record, process, analyze, and store communication data.  If you disagree with any part of these terms, do not use the Site.
7. Virtual Communications
Indeed may offer you the option to manage virtual and remote communications with Job Seekers within Indeed products, including but not limited to, Indeed Interview, Indeed Hiring Platform, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”). Services may include giving you access to scheduling, video conferencing, web conferencing, meeting rooms, pre-recorded videos, pre-recorded audios and other collaborative services offered by third-party telecommunications service providers. You understand that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider. Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission of virtual communications. Indeed does not guarantee (1) availability of such services at the time You attempt to initiate them (2) the quality of such services, or (3) the dates or times you’ve arranged with Job Seekers for your Virtual Interview. Further, Indeed does not verify the identities or qualifications of Job Seekers with whom you arrange Virtual Interviews.
You are solely responsible for offering alternative methods of communicating or interviewing for individuals with disabilities, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE OR DATA THAT YOU TRANSMIT WHILE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT, INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, OR YOUR IMAGE OR LIKENESS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, INDEED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OR PROTECTING ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT DURING YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. INDEED ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR THE MISUSE OF ANY DATA YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT THROUGH USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INDEED DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR AVAILABILITY OR RETENTION OF ANY RECORDINGS OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
Upon your request, Indeed may extend invitations to additional representatives at your company to join Virtual Interviews. You understand and agree that Indeed will extend such invitations on your behalf based on the email addresses you provide for those representatives but Indeed is not responsible for inaccuracies in the contact information you provide. Further, Indeed is not responsible, and you are solely responsible for the conduct or actions of your representatives. You represent that you have the authority to bind your additional representatives to Indeed’s Terms, and by extending invitations to your representatives, you are binding them to Indeed’s Terms.
You understand that Indeed is only providing the option for you to communicate with Job Seekers via services that may be offered by third-party providers. Indeed is not a party to your Virtual Interviews and is not a participant in any arrangements you make with Job Seekers. You are responsible for any requests for accommodations from Job Seekers. For example, if a sign language interpreter is requested, it is your responsibility to provide one if you are legally obligated to.
Recording Virtual Interviews: As an Employer, you may be presented with an option to enable recording of Virtual Interviews. You acknowledge and agree that you will not record, store, or analyze Virtual Interviews without permission from Job Seekers and all participants. By recording a Virtual Interview, you represent and warrant to Indeed that you have secured all necessary consent and will comply with all applicable laws, including state and federal law regarding consent to record interviews and phone calls. By choosing to record Virtual Interviews through the Site, you agree that third-party providers and Indeed can store and access the recording. However, you agree that Indeed is not obligated to store or retain any recording of a Virtual Interview. YOU FURTHER AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD INDEED HARMLESS FROM ANY ALLEGATIONS, CLAIMS, ACTIONS, SUITS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, SETTLEMENTS, JUDGMENTS, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS) THAT ARISE FROM THE RECORDING OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
Virtual Evaluations: You shall only use the recordings and other information obtained through Virtual Evaluations for your internal hiring purposes. You shall not use Virtual Evaluations for any illegal, discriminatory or fraudulent purpose. As part of Virtual Evaluations, you will submit or approve interview questions which Indeed will share with candidates. You agree that the interview questions are part of your application process and determined solely by you. Indeed may provide you with the ability to directly invite candidates to participate in Virtual Evaluations or you may instruct Indeed to automatically invite candidates who meet your selection criteria, for example, all candidates who submit an application through the Site. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of Virtual Evaluations, including how you decide which candidates shall be invited to participate in Virtual Evaluations, who you decide to contact after the Virtual Evaluation has been completed and any employment related decisions that you make. Indeed does not act as your employment agency by offering you the Virtual Evaluations service. A candidate’s Virtual Evaluation video will only be deemed complete and submitted to you when the candidate approves the submission through the Virtual Evaluations tool. Indeed reserves the right to not submit a candidate’s response if a candidate or Employer uses the tool in an abusive manner, which shall be determined in Indeed’s sole discretion. You agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing any candidate submissions through Virtual Evaluations, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements. You acknowledge and agree that the video recordings and transcripts associated with Virtual Evaluations will only be retained for a period of one year from the date that the recording is completed by the Job Seeker (“One Year Period”).  After the relevant One Year Period, the video recording and transcript will be permanently deleted and you will no longer be able to view or access them. You acknowledge that the Virtual Evaluations video recordings contain personal and confidential information, and you confirm that those you’re sharing the Virtual Evaluations video link with have permission to view the recording. The term User Content as defined in these Terms of Service shall include the content of the interview questions, as well as the content of the Virtual Evaluations video recordings, transcripts and any other information that you or a Job Seeker sends through Virtual Evaluations.
8. Company Pages, Enhanced Profiles, Employer Branding Hub
When you post a Job Ad directly on the Site, Indeed and/or Glassdoor may automatically generate for you a Company Page and/or a Glassdoor Profile Page. You understand that Indeed may display publicly available information about your company on the Company Page, in accordance with applicable law. You authorize Indeed to claim such Company Page for you on your behalf, which will be marked as a “Claimed Profile” (or similar wording) and allows you to edit and add information to the Company Page. Company Pages allow User Content (as defined below) to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Company identified on the Company Page. Additionally, Indeed may include all of your Job Ads posted on the Site on your Company Page, including those posted directly on the Site as well as those indexed by Indeed from other sources. You agree that you are solely responsible for any content you edit or put on a Company Page, whether generated by or for you, including photograph(s) or videos you provide, and third-party websites reachable from content you put on a Company Page.
Indeed may offer Indeed Company Pages Premium (“CMPP”) and Glassdoor Enhanced Profile (“EP”) (collectively, “Employer Branding Hub”), which include features accessible only on a subscription basis and may be charged as indicated in an insertion order (“IO”). An IO is a separate agreement between you and Indeed that incorporates these Terms. Access to features accessible only by subscription is limited to one Company Page per subscription. Indeed reserves the right to change or remove Company Page, CMPP, or Employer Branding Hub features at any time, in Indeed’s sole discretion. Employer Branding Hub features may include analytics, insights, or other figures, which Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of, and you are responsible for determining their suitability for your intended use or purpose. Use of EP (including Company Structures) and analytics and review analysis provided by Glassdoor are subject to the
Glassdoor Terms of Use
, except to the extent of any conflict with these Indeed Terms of Service for Employers, in which case these Indeed Terms of Service for Employers will govern.

You may continue to be charged for your Company Structures until you either renew your EBH or cancel your Company Structures. Indeed is a reseller of Glassdoor products and services, and all invoice and payment processing for such products and services shall be undertaken by Indeed and subject to Indeed’s
Privacy Policy
.
Please note that Indeed and Glassdoor host User Content submitted by our users. User Content includes salaries, company reviews, interview reviews, company photos, answers to Q&A questions on Company Pages or Employer Branding Hub, and other materials and content provided by users to Indeed and Glassdoor. We moderate User Content using the same standard of review for all employers and do not provide preferential treatment for our customers. You understand and agree that our application of User Content moderation policies, and our decision of whether or not to remove a piece of User Content, is within our sole discretion and cannot form the basis of a violation of this Agreement.
You may cancel your participation in CMPP, EP, or Employer Branding Hub at any time by notifying Indeed. Such cancellation is generally effective at the beginning of the next calendar month; except as otherwise indicated on your IO for any EBH annual subscription that automatically renews, if you have prepaid for an annual subscription then cancellation is effective immediately and Indeed will provide a prorated refund of the unused subscription term, which may include any discounts as applicable. Except as otherwise indicated on your IO, annual subscriptions will not automatically renew, and need to be renewed each year through an IO. If you purchase an EBH annual subscription that automatically renews, you acknowledge and agree that your subscription will automatically renew and Indeed will charge you on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription and such cancellation goes into effect, which may not be until the next billing cycle. Except to the extent a different cancellation method is specifically indicated on your IO for any EBH annual subscription that automatically renews, to cancel your EBH annual subscription auto renewal without incurring any charges, email your sales representative and renewals@glassdoor.com no later than 30 days prior to your renewal date. You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate.
Indeed may offer some Employers the opportunity to be displayed more prominently, or in an enhanced way, on the Site (“Featured Employer”). Featured Employer is awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion. The ability to receive a Featured Employer designation, generally, is a function of the number of Ads and amount you spend on eligible Sponsored Job campaigns. The Featured Employer program may be changed or removed by Indeed at any time, at Indeed’s sole discretion and without notice.

If you or anyone at your company is a member of Indeed Academy, your use of the Graduate logos is limited to your individual use only, and solely for purposes of indicating your Graduate status.

If you make any representation to the contrary, Indeed may remove you from Indeed Academy in its sole discretion.

The franchisor or corporate headquarters may request that Indeed contact its franchisees or local offices, respectively, by providing Indeed with contact information, and may provide the content of Job Ads to Indeed for use in connection with Extended Campaign Tools. By using Extended Campaign Tools, you agree to this information being shared, and you represent and warrant that i) all information you provide to Indeed is accurate, and ii) you have all necessary right and authorization to provide such information to Indeed and to permit Indeed to share it in connection with Extended Campaign Tools. You may request that Indeed grant access and control of your Extended Campaign Tools account to additional users. You understand and agree that by submitting such requests, Indeed will contact the users based on the information you provide (name, email address, and job title) and that Indeed is not responsible for verifying the users prior to completion of such requests.
15. Candidate Import
Indeed may offer a platform that allows you, or someone acting on your behalf or authority (such as a recruitment management service), to upload information about job applicants to Indeed and to interact with these individuals and direct Indeed to interact with these individuals on your behalf (hereafter “Candidate Import”). To the extent that any information you provide or otherwise make available to Indeed through our Candidate Import service includes Client Personal Data (as defined below), you instruct Indeed to process such information on your behalf pursuant to this Agreement and any applicable Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”); Client Personal Data and Indeed as used in this Section shall have the meanings given to them in the Data Processing Addendum in this Agreement. By using Candidate Import, you instruct Indeed to display information about the interactions (including Virtual Interviews which are currently scheduled or were previously conducted) between you or Indeed and the job applicants within their Indeed accounts, and you represent and warrant that you, and any third party who you have authorized to upload Client Personal Data to the platform, have obtained all necessary rights and permissions from, and provided all necessary information and disclosures to, job applicants as required under applicable data protection or other relevant law for you to provide or otherwise make available Client Personal Data to Indeed using Candidate Import, and, without limiting the foregoing, (a) no individual whose Personal Data you provide or otherwise make available to Indeed using Candidate Import has exercised any right or made any request to you that would prevent or otherwise limit your ability to share such individual’s Personal Data with Indeed for processing in connection with this Agreement and (b) all job applicants have consented that their data will be shared with Indeed (in accordance with Indeed’s Terms and Privacy Policy) and that Indeed may contact them over email as part of your hiring process, including asking them to create an account with Indeed. You agree to defend and indemnify Indeed for any breach of the foregoing sentence. You also agree that Indeed is only responsible for such Client Personal Data, in accordance with the DPA, once it is received by Indeed and you are responsible for such Client Personal Data up until such receipt by Indeed and thereafter with respect to your use of such Client Personal Data.
C. Terms of Service for Publishers
The following Indeed Publisher Program Terms (“IPP Terms”) apply to any Publisher that accesses, participates, or uses the Indeed Publisher Program (the “Publisher Program”), that accesses or uses an Application Programming Interface created or maintained by Indeed (“API”) related to publishing jobs (such as Indeed’s Publisher API or Publisher Job Search API), or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these IPP Terms, and set out the terms and conditions applicable to your participation in the Program. Any references to “Indeed” shall mean Indeed, Inc. For purposes of this Section C of the Indeed General Terms of Service, “You” or “Publisher” means any entity identified in an enrollment form,application, or questionnaire response submitted by the same or affiliated persons, and/or any agency or network acting on its (or their) behalf, which shall also be bound by these IPP Terms.
1. Indeed Publisher Program
Indeed’s Publisher Program is offered on a limited basis, in limited quantities, in limited locations, and for a limited time. Indeed shall have absolute discretion as to whether or not it accepts a particular applicant or site for participation in the Publisher Program or any part thereof. Publishers are ineligible to participate if their web properties do not conform with the terms of the
Indeed Affiliate Acceptable Use Policy
(the “AAUP”). To participate as a Publisher in the Publisher Program, all participants must be at least eighteen years of age. Participants represent and warrant that all information submitted to Indeed shall be true, accurate and complete.
Publisher acknowledges that by accessing the Site, any Indeed API, or participating in the Publisher Program, Publisher may come into contact with content (including User Content, as defined below) that it finds harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and Publisher acknowledges that Indeed shall have no liability with respect to such content.
2. Publisher Obligations
Any job search results, JobrollTM, pay-per-click, pay-per-apply, or pay-per-started-apply advertisements, and any Indeed logos or other elements supplied by Indeed for use on Affiliates’ websites or websites co-branded by Indeed and Affiliate (collectively, “Program Elements”) may only appear on URLs that Indeed has reviewed and accepted for participation (“Accepted URLs”). Publisher shall advise Indeed of any changes in the type of content accessible at any such accepted URL. Publisher agrees to comply with the specifications provided by Indeed from time to time to enable proper delivery, display, tracking and reporting of Program Elements.
Publisher shall label each displayed Program Element with the phrase “Jobs by Indeed”, wherein the word “Jobs” shall be hyperlinked to
http://www.indeed.com
or other Indeed website as agreed with Indeed and the word “Indeed” shall be the Indeed Logo Image and shall also be hyperlinked to
http://www.indeed.com
or other Indeed website as agreed by Indeed. We provide the
Indeed Logo Image
online for your convenience.
Publisher accepts and agrees to abide by all terms of the
https://www.indeed.com/legal?co=US#aaup
and
Indeed API Terms
. Publisher is permitted to use Indeed’s Site and its content solely pursuant to the terms of the Publisher Program. Publisher shall comply with the terms of this Agreement including the Site Rules. Publisher agrees that it is solely responsible for (and that Indeed has no responsibility or liability to it or to any third party for) any breach of Publisher’s obligations under these IPP Terms and for any consequences (including any loss or damage which Indeed may suffer) of any such breach.
As Indeed wishes to prohibit automated entities from following any individual links posted by Publisher, all hyperlinks to Indeed’s site should include the use of rel=”nofollow”. This applies to editorially placed links, links generated by Indeed’s API, or other link mechanisms.
Publisher hereby grants Indeed permission to refer to Publisher and its websites in Indeed’s marketing materials, wherever such marketing materials shall appear.
3. Payments to Publisher
PUBLISHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT SHALL NOT RECEIVE ANY MONETARY COMPENSATION, INCLUDING COMMISSION PAYMENTS, FOR ACCESSING, PARTICIPATING, OR USING THE INDEED PUBLISHER PROGRAM.
Publisher agrees that it shall not be compensated for any clicks received or transactions generated by Publisher or any party acting on Publisher’s behalf. In addition, Indeed shall not be obligated to pay for any artificial and/or fraudulent impressions or clicks as determined by Indeed or if Publisher is in breach of these IPP Terms. No dashboard or any other view of any click count shall be considered as contractually binding on the Site.
4. Termination
Indeed may suspend or terminate the Publisher Program at our sole discretion, at any time, with or without notice, and for any or no reason. Either party may terminate these IPP Terms and participation in the Publisher Program at any time for any or no reason with or without notice and without liability. If you wish to terminate agreement to these IPP Terms, you may do so by sending a notice by email to support-at-indeed dot com or other email address specified by Indeed. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including without limitation, confidentiality, warranty disclaimers, indemnifications, and limitations of liability.
Upon termination of a publisher from the Publisher Program, for any reason and by either party, Publisher’s API access shall cease and Publisher shall immediately remove all insertion codes and other Program Elements from all pages of its websites.
5. Confidentiality
Publisher shall not disclose Indeed Confidential Information without Indeed’s prior written consent. “Indeed Confidential Information” includes without limitation: (a) all Indeed software, technology, programming, specifications, materials, guidelines and documentation relating to the Publisher Program; (b) click-through rates or other performance statistics relating to the Publisher Program provided to Publisher by Indeed; and (c) any other information designated in writing by Indeed as “Confidential” or an equivalent designation.
6. Indemnification
Publisher shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, licensors, and partners from any third party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of Publisher’s Program use, Publisher Property, site or Publisher Services, or breach of these IPP Terms.
7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These IPP Terms and any dispute arising out of or in connection with these IPP Terms or related in any way to the Site (“Dispute”) will be governed as to all matters, including, but not limited to the validity, construction and performance of these IPP terms and this Agreement, by and under the laws of the State of Texas without giving effect to conflicts of law principles thereof. Any and all actions, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings related to such Dispute shall be filed only in federal or state courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A.. Each of the parties hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A..
You also hereby waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to your use of the Site, the Publisher Program, or these terms of service, if you are located in the United States.
8. Class Action Waiver
By using the Site or any Program Elements and in return for the services offered by Indeed, Publisher acknowledges that Indeed can only offer Publisher these services under the terms and conditions as presented herein. As partial consideration for Publisher’s use of the Site and the Publisher Program, Publisher agrees not to sue Indeed as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against Indeed regarding Publisher’s use of the Site or the Publisher Program. Additionally, as a Publisher, the use of the Site and the Publisher Program is at no charge and Publisher acknowledges that part of the price it is paying to use this Site and the Publisher Program is its acceptance of these terms of service including this Class Action Waiver. If Publisher does not agree to any part of these terms, Publisher should not continue use of the Site, the Publisher Program, or any Program Elements. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits Publisher’s rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff, including in small claims court, subject to the jurisdiction requirements found in Section 7 above.
D. Terms of Service for All Users

For information on Indeed’s compliance with the Digital Services Act, please see Section E Digital Services Act (“DSA”).
1. When You Use Our Site
By using the Site, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed collects, records, processes, analyzes, and stores any and all activities you take on the Site, and any and all interactions and communications you have with, on, or through the Site. This includes: which areas of the Site you visit (including URLs), which content you view, which info you input, whether and where you click, scroll, hover-over, mouseover, or otherwise interact with or communicate with or through the Site, the timing of each activity, and time spent on each activity. For example, when you search for Jobs on the Site, send or open an email to or from Indeed or an Indeed email alias, message another user on the Site, chat with a customer support representative or bot, speak with Indeed personnel, submit an application on the Site, participate in an interview on the Site, or otherwise engage with us or others through the Site, Indeed collects, records, processes, analyzes, and stores your activities, interactions and communications. Indeed collects this data from everyone using the Site, including users of private browsing mode, “incognito mode,” or similar modes. Indeed uses vendors as an extension of the Site to collect, record, process, analyze, and store this data. We use this data for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to offer and improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service. You authorize Indeed to use this data, User Content (defined below to encompass items such as resumes) and AI-Generated Content (defined below) to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence and machine learning models, and no compensation in any form shall be due or payable to you in connection with Indeed’s exercise of its rights granted under this Section.
When you use the site, you are requesting that Indeed send data, text, and images which may be stored in temporary or permanent storage in your device. You may delete this data by clearing third-party cookies from your browser and device. For more information on controlling tracking technology, please visit our
Privacy Policy
. You authorize Indeed to make any connections with wires, lines, cables, or instruments, including with communication systems, that it may decide to make from time to time in connection with operating the Site. You further authorize Indeed to use processes that record or decode dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information. You acknowledge that the foregoing is necessary to the operation of the Site.
Occasionally, Indeed tests improvements and updates to our Site and services (including for fraud and bot control), which may affect various aspects of the Site such as job applications (including delivery of test applications), the ad delivery system, audience, ad performance, ad placement, profiles, resumes, resume search, job search, recommendations, alerts, or formatting. You agree that Indeed may conduct such tests without notice to you. Indeed’s services and their availability may differ by location, and you should check the Site in your location to see which services are available to you.
Indeed may offer suggestions, recommendations, or information to users that may support or improve their experience on the Site. These offerings are provided as a courtesy and without warranty, and are based on information provided by other users, and your use of such information is at your own risk. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any decisions you make, or actions you take, using information obtained through the Site.
2. User Content
Some parts of the Site, or our APIs, allow users to post content or data such as Job Ads, resumes, reviews, information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials. This functionality helps users find information and communicate about potential jobs, schools and certifications, employers, and candidates. Any data that a user or other party submits, posts, publishes, displays, or makes available on or through the Site, or otherwise provides to Indeed, is called “User Content.” User Content includes Job Ads, Resumes, reviews, school reviews, certification or license reviews, and messages sent through the Site.
Indeed is not responsible for User Content, which may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or deceptive. Indeed does not know whether User Content is true. Any opinion, fact, advice, information, or statement in User Content is the sole responsibility of its original author, who may use anonymous identifiers. You may come into contact with content that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent, or objectionable. User Content may not be reliable or suitable for use in a legal proceeding. You acknowledge that Indeed has no obligation or liability with regard to publishing, monitoring, or removing User Content. Indeed also has no obligation or liability regarding the accuracy of User Content which may be translated on our site through a Google Translate API.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy including the translation of any user generated content which is translated using Google Translate API, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Company Page.
Content Moderation:
If you provide User Content, it must comply with the Site Rules (below),
Indeed’s policies
, and Indeed’s Terms of Service. These rules, policies, and terms include but are not limited to the following: Your User Content must not be unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, irrelevant, or unconstructive. Your User Content must not contain sexual, ethnic, or racial or other discriminating slurs. Your User Content must not contain proprietary information, trade secrets, intellectual property of another person, or confidential information. Your User Content must not contain spam, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or any other commercial communication besides Job Ads under this Agreement. Your User Content must not be harmful to anyone, especially minors.
In order to be eligible for visibility on the site, job postings must offer open jobs (not training opportunities, expired positions, etc.), provide a detailed and accurate description of the role and be free of vulgar or illicit content, in addition to meeting other criteria outlined
here
.
You may not post official identification information, such as a social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier, or any background check information. Posting such identification information on the internet may lead to identity theft for which Indeed cannot be responsible. You may not post highly confidential personal information, such as medical or health information, or other categories of personal data subject to data breach notification requirements in any country.
By submitting a review or otherwise providing information, ratings, or answers to questions about your former or current employer, you agree that such User Content may be shown publicly on or through the Site and may include your job title, job location, whether you are a current or former employee, and the date on which you provided the User Content. You agree that Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for such User Content, including for any content that you include that may personally identify you. If you do not want your User Content to be publicly visible through the Site or to personally identify you, do not provide such User Content.
Indeed may monitor and screen User Content and may use it to prevent potentially illegal or tortious activities, or any other activities that are detrimental to other users. In some cases, if we determine that your User Content or actions have violated our Terms or any Indeed policy or are detrimental to other users, we may place restrictions on other accounts that we suspect are affiliated or associated with you. If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please
contact Indeed
. However, detection methods are not perfect and false positives or false negatives may occur. Indeed has no obligation to monitor any particular user or User Content, and Indeed makes no guarantee that any particular User Content will be removed. You agree that any reporting feature or moderation functionality that Indeed may implement or make available, in its sole discretion, is not a commercially available product. You also agree that any reporting feature Indeed may make available is not a first response hotline and Indeed has no obligation to remove any User Content reported to Indeed.
Indeed reserves the right to disclose all User Content, and any other relevant information and circumstances, to any third party in connection with operating the Site; to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. This means, for example, that Indeed may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to disclose User Content you have provided. Your identity may be discoverable via such legal requests, even if you post confidentially or anonymously.
Indeed is an interactive computer service, has no obligation to host or remove any particular User Content, and may exclude or remove any User Content from any part of the Site or services for any or no reason. Indeed has no obligation to include any User Content in any part of the Site (for example, Job Ads in search results). Whether any User Content violates any Indeed policy, whether to publish or to withdraw from publication any User Content, and whether to exclude any material that any party seeks to post on the Site, will always remain within the sole discretion of Indeed. You agree that Indeed has no liability or obligation to you or anyone else arising from its editorial decisions.
Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act provides:
(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
(2) Civil liability
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of-
(A)
any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or
(B)
any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).
3. License to User Content and Feedback
When you provide User Content you grant Indeed a license to use it. Specifically, you grant Indeed a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, (revocable only as described below), fully paid, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple layers of sub-licensees) right and license to make, use, sell, sublicense, reformat, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, prepare derivative works from and otherwise exploit all User Content you post or submit, for the purpose of publishing material on the Indeed website or its publishers or third party sites, maintaining or improving the Indeed website (including without limitation for the purposes of training a model that recommends content to other users), and promoting Indeed and such User Content without restriction. No compensation in any form shall be due or payable to you in connection with Indeed’s exercise of its rights under the license granted under this Section. To the extent any compensation may be due under applicable law as a result of, or in connection with, Indeed’s exercise of these rights, you hereby waive any and all rights to such compensation to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Indeed shall terminate this licensed use within a commercially reasonable term after User Content has been removed from the Indeed website. Indeed reserves the right to refuse to accept, post, display or make available any User Content at its sole discretion.
Furthermore, you grant to Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees a license to use your name, user name, and/or trademarks and logos in connection with (i) any such User Content, (ii) any Indeed marketing materials containing or incorporating such User Content, or (iii) any actions by Indeed to promote or publicize such User Content (e.g. Job Listings), such as the use of keywords in third-party internet search engines. To any extent that such User Content contains your name, likeness, voice or image, you hereby irrevocably waive all legal and equitable rights relating to claims for violation of your rights of publicity (or any similar claims) arising directly or indirectly from Indeed’s exercise of its rights pursuant to the license granted hereunder.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the User Content that you provide, or that you have the right to grant this license, (ii) your User Content, and Indeed’s use of it, will not violate applicable law or the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or other rights of any person, and (iii) use of your User Content will not result in any breach of contract between you and any third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, damages, and any other monies owed to any person by reason of such User Content. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Indeed and its affiliates from any claims resulting from any such User Content. If you wish to request to revoke the license granted by you in this Section for any such User Content, please send a certified letter of request to the postal address listed above with a copy of your passport or national identity card (for identity verification purposes) and request removal of such User Content. Your certified letter of request must include (a) the signature of the applicable rights holder for such User Content or a person authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder; (b) identification of the User Content for which the license is to be revoked, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate and remove such User Content on the Site; (c) your name, address, telephone number, and email address; (d) a statement that you have a good faith belief that you are the rights holder or authorized by the rights holder to revoke the license for the designated User Content; and (e) a statement that the information in the request is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rights holder or are authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder with respect to such User Content.
At your discretion, you may provide feedback or opinions about Indeed or the Site, such as identifying potential errors, improvements, modifications, bug fixes, or enhancements (“Feedback”). Indeed is free to use such Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and free to disclose such Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.  If you provide Feedback to Indeed, you hereby grant to Indeed a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple layers of sublicensees) right and license to make, use, sell, sublicense, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, prepare derivative works from and otherwise exploit all such Feedback for any purpose without restriction. Indeed may disclose any or all Feedback to any third party in any manner, and may sublicense any or all Feedback in any form to any third party without restriction. Accepting any Feedback does not constitute a waiver of any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Indeed, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

This includes webforms, links, or attachments of any type, scripts, macros, or any other form of code. You agree the determination of what constitutes spam is in Indeed’s sole discretion.

5. Accessing External Sites
The Site links to other sites on the internet which are owned and operated by third parties (“External Sites”), for example Employer websites, Applicant Tracking Systems, or promotional websites. Links to External Sites may be found in User Content available through the Site (for example, Resumes or Job Ads). Indeed is not responsible or liable for any External Site, including availability or content. Links to External Sites may be removed at any time. Any concerns regarding an External Site should be directed to the responsible third party.
Indeed has no control over what happens on External Sites. If you visit an External Site and complete a transaction outside Indeed, you are entering into an agreement with a third party, alone and at your own risk. You are giving the third party your data directly, and your rights and their obligations are determined by its privacy policies and terms of service. Indeed disclaims all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize or transact with such third parties. We are additionally not responsible for any payment that may be asked of you by such third party.
Indeed may provide you with access to a link on Indeed to services or products offered and performed by a third party (“Third-Party Service”). For example, this service may be offered in the form of permitting a Jobseeker to request their own background check or permitting an Employer to request a background check of a Jobseeker.  Indeed operates solely as a technical conduit, allowing the transmission of background checks sent by a background check Third-Party Service to you. Please note (and you acknowledge) that Indeed cannot and does not assemble, access, view, analyze, manipulate, alter, evaluate or store the background check reports provided by any background check Third-Party Service to you or to any other Indeed user.
If you choose to use the third-party link and its services or products, you are contracting directly with the Third-Party Service, and Indeed is not a party to this contract. Further, you agree to fully indemnify and defend Indeed for any claims arising out of your use of a Third-Party Service’s services or product provided to you by a Third-Party Service.
The Site may include information provided by third-party APIs, which is subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by those third parties. For example, the Site may include Google Maps features and content, which is subject to the current versions of: (1) the
Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service
; and (2) the
Google Privacy Policy
. Company Page data from Japan may come from Toyo Keizai Shinpo Inc.
6. Creating and Accessing Your Account
Some areas of the Site require you to register, provide and verify an email address or phone number, or create an account. You agree to provide information that is true, accurate, current, and complete. You may not create multiple accounts, or create accounts by automated means.
Indeed encourages you to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account where available.
If you do not enable 2FA, you proceed at your own risk. You are responsible for the confidentiality and use of your username and password, which may not be shared. Your account is accessible by anyone with your username and password and who can answer your verification questions. If someone obtains unauthorized access to your account, they could contact users or take other actions through your account, and Indeed’s ability to respond is limited.
If you change your phone number provided for 2FA or verification, the change may not be reflected everywhere on
Indeed.com
, such as the phone number and opt-ins provided through a Job Seeker Profile. An Employer may still be able to contact you at the number in your Profile, if you have opted in to be contacted on that page.
Indeed may send you a notice relating to account security, such as informing you that you may have recently interacted with a compromised account. Indeed cannot and does not guarantee that such notices will always be sent or received, and you therefore agree that Indeed bears no responsibility for doing so. Indeed makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices.
You may be given the option to use a Passkey (such as a face scan or fingerprint) to sign in to your Indeed account. Passkeys are stored locally on your device, and their management are subject to your control. Indeed does not receive any biometric data or other information related to your Passkey.  Indeed is not responsible for any collection, use, storage, processing, or loss of Passkey data nor is it responsible for any legal obligations related to such data.

7. Your Contact Information
As part of the Services, Indeed may contact you through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including with contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party sources.
By providing Indeed with a phone number, you confirm that you are the primary user and subscriber to the telephone number entered, and you expressly agree to receiving calls and texts at that number, including if it is a mobile number.
To stop receiving text messages at any time, reply to the text with STOP or
contact Indeed Customer Support
. DUE TO THE UNSTRUCTURED CONVERSATIONAL FORMAT OF THIS SERVICE, WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OTHER UNSUBSCRIBE ATTEMPTS. Texting STOP in response to an Indeed SMS alert will unsubscribe you from Indeed SMS alerts. However, you may continue to receive texts related to some offerings to which you have subscribed, such as Hiring Events. In order to unsubscribe from these, you must respond STOP within the specific text flows of those offerings. Please note that replying STOP to any text message would unsubscribe you from text messages only, but you may still receive other communications from Indeed.
You may also revoke your consent to receive text messages by terminating the Agreement through closing your Indeed account. Indeed cannot be responsible for third parties to whom you have provided your phone number.
To stop receiving marketing or commercial emails from Indeed, or to manage your email preferences, you may do so by updating your email settings on your Indeed account. You may also opt out of marketing or commercial emails from Indeed by following the unsubscribe link in our messages.
In the United States, Indeed may make publicly available information aggregated from various sources searchable by third parties (like Employers) through the Indeed Resume Search Program or Smart Sourcing. We make that information available on a limited basis and for a limited time to help Employers find and connect with potential job seekers about an Employer’s Job Listings or job opportunities, and such information may not be used for any other purpose. You may remove your publicly available information from the Program and unsubscribe from receiving potential job opportunities from Employers by following the unsubscribe link in our messages. To delete your publicly available information from our Site, submit this

8. Payment
You will be charged as indicated by the Site, as well as any separate Insertion Order or other contract with Indeed.
By providing your credit card, bank account, or other payment method information to Indeed, you authorize Indeed to charge or debit that payment method for fees owed to Indeed for services purchased, pursuant to the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using and any other agreement with Indeed for purchase of services.
By providing your bank account information and signing up for direct debits from Indeed, you authorize Indeed to use ACH to debit the bank account specified for any amount owed for charges arising from your use of Indeed’s services and/or purchase of products from Indeed, pursuant to these terms, until this authorization is revoked.
Advertising
Advertising you purchase may be measured by clicks, RSVPs, applies, impressions, or a subscription or platform fee.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s measurements (such as click count). Indeed’s measurements (such as click count) shall be binding.
Indeed’s measurements may be derived from data from third-party vendors, such as publishers.
Subscriptions
Details regarding the subscription or plan are available on the Site at the time of purchase. If you purchase a subscription plan, you acknowledge and agree that your subscription will automatically renew and Indeed will charge you on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription plan and such cancellation goes into effect, which may not be until the next billing cycle. These charges to your credit card or debits to your bank account will be made to the payment method chosen by you.
Pausing your subscription does not cancel it. Your subscription will continue to automatically renew after being unpaused.
THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED BILLING CYCLES UNDER THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION PLAN. AMOUNTS FOR FUTURE PREPAID UNUSED BILLING CYCLES MAY RESULT IN A PRORATED REFUND OF THE UNUSED BILLING CYCLES, WHICH SHALL BE DETERMINED IN INDEED’S SOLE DISCRETION.
Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.
Billing Policies
Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail, unless otherwise specified by Indeed. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 120 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card or bank account dispute rights).
Any credit card, bank account information, and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, for the purposes of verifying your account, checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed, and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed may obtain updated payment information for credit and debit cards through payment card networks, card issuers or other third party sources. Indeed may use the updated card and bank account information to charge amounts you owe. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. If your Indeed account has a credit card or bank account on file for one Indeed service, we will charge that same payment method for other purchases unless otherwise indicated by you. You may not delete a credit card from your Indeed account if it is the only payment method on file and you have outstanding invoices or charges to your Indeed account.
Change of Address: If you have provided a billing address to us, and you change such billing address from an address within the United States to an address outside the United States, or from an address outside of the United States to an address inside the United States, you will continue to be bound by this Agreement with the same Indeed party for the remainder of the calendar month in which you made the change. Beginning on the first day of the next calendar month, you hereby agree that you will be bound by this Agreement with the applicable Indeed party identified in the first paragraph of this Agreement with respect to such new territory.
If your Indeed account has a credit card or other payment method on file, such as bank account information for ACH payment, Indeed may charge that payment method for any products or services you order, and for any other outstanding payments, including to correct billing errors.
Currency
If you are located in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US dollars. If your billing address is in India, you shall pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you shall pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the
Asia-Pacific Region
*, you shall pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, or US Dollars.
If your billing address is anywhere else, you may be able to pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euros, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, Mexican Pesos, or Japanese Yen. This choice of currencies is subject to Indeed’s approval, which may be withheld in Indeed’s sole discretion.
Taxes
Charges are exclusive of all taxes and VAT.  You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefor. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services.
Regulatory Fees
You may be charged fees to cover the increased operating costs of complying with certain local legislation in certain countries. Fees will be added to your invoice subtotal, included as a line item on invoices, and paid or charged to your payment method in the normal course and in accordance with Indeed’s billing policies and practices.
Refunds
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Indeed may offer refunds for Indeed services for a period of four (4) months from the date of purchase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indeed will not provide refunds in case of abuse of our policies, and any and all refunds are ultimately at the sole discretion of Indeed.
You agree to pay (i) penalties for late payment as per contemporaneous US Federal Reserve interest rates plus 10%, or the maximum interest permitted by law, whichever is lower, and (ii) a statutory lump-sum indemnity for recovery cost, if provided for under applicable laws, and (iii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late payments.
9. Other Services
Indeed Apps.
“Indeed Apps” means our downloadable applications available in device application marketplaces, such as the Indeed Job Search, Indeed Resume Search/Smart Sourcing, Indeed Employer, and Indeed Job Spotter. This Agreement applies to your use of any Indeed App. The legal entity responsible for the Indeed App is the one specified in this Agreement, even if the entity identified as the developer on an application marketplace is Indeed, Inc.
If you allow an Indeed App to use your device’s location service, the Indeed App may collect information based on your device’s geographic location. Some location data is linked to your account (for example, “coarse” location data collected by an iOS app). Other location data the Indeed Apps collect is not linked to your account (for example, “precise” location data collected by an iOS app) but is still used by Indeed.
Apple-Specific Terms.
In addition to your agreement with the foregoing terms and conditions, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the following provisions apply with respect to your use of any mobile application version of the Site compatible with the iOS operating system of Apple Inc. (“Apple”, and such mobile application, the “App”). Apple is not a party to this Agreement and does not own and is not responsible for the App. Apple is not providing any warranty for the App except, if applicable, to refund the purchase price for it. Apple is not responsible for maintenance or other support services for the App and shall not be responsible for any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses with respect to the App, including any third-party product liability claims, claims that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation, and claims with respect to intellectual property infringement. Any inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the App, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to Indeed in accordance with the “Questions or Complaints” section above. The license you have been granted herein is limited to a non-transferable license to use the App on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple’s iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by you, or as otherwise permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Service. In addition, you must comply with the terms of any third-party agreement applicable to you when using the App, such as your wireless data service agreement. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof; notwithstanding the foregoing, Indeed’s right to enter into, rescind or terminate any variation, waiver or settlement under this Agreement is not subject to the consent of any third party.
E-Signature.
The Site may offer e-signature options, which may be powered by a third-party service provider. By using e-signatures on the Site, you agree that your e-signature is intended to authenticate the document you are signing, and your e-signature will have the same force and effect as a manual signature. Indeed is not a legal record keeper. Your use of e-signatures is at your own risk, and it is your responsibility to ensure that your document is received and to retain your own copies.
Beta Program.
Indeed may offer beta products or features on our Site, identified by the word “Beta” or “Test” (“Beta Products”). Beta Products may be offered in limited quantities, in limited locations, and for a limited time. Indeed may discontinue or cancel all or part of a Beta Product at any time without prior notice to you.
ANY BETA PRODUCT IS IN TESTING PHASE AND IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND IS BELIEVED TO CONTAIN DEFECTS. A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF TESTING A BETA PRODUCT IS TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK ON PERFORMANCE. YOU ARE ADVISED TO SAFEGUARD IMPORTANT DATA, TO USE CAUTION, AND NOT RELY IN ANY WAY ON THE CORRECT FUNCTIONING OR PERFORMANCE OF THE BETA PRODUCT.
If you have been invited to test a Beta Product, you agree that, unless otherwise specifically provided herein or agreed by Indeed in writing, any Beta Product constitutes confidential proprietary information of Indeed. You shall permit only authorized users to access the Beta Product. You agree not to transfer, copy, or disclose such confidential information without the prior written consent of Indeed.
AI-Generated Content.
Indeed may make available content created in whole or in part by an algorithm (including “artificial intelligence” and machine learning algorithms), which may be generated in response to information you provide through the Site (“AI-Generated Content”). AI-Generated Content may include chatbots, draft cover letters or resumes, career recommendations, template job descriptions, messages or highlights/summaries. AI-Generated Content is a Beta Product under this Agreement. The use of AI-Generated Content is a rapidly evolving field of study and we are working to improve our use of AI-Generated Content to make it more accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. AI-Generated Content may be generated in whole or in part by third-party service providers such as OpenAI. The AI-Generated Content is owned by or otherwise licensed by Indeed and is subject to Indeed’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You agree that you do not have any intellectual property rights in any AI offering, any models, or AI-Generated Content on the Site. Given the variable nature of this type of content, AI-Generated Content is provided “as is” and Indeed makes no warranty that AI-Generated Content is appropriate, accurate, inoffensive, unbiased, non-infringing, legal, or safe, and disclaims all liability for AI-Generated Content.
Use of AI-Generated Content is entirely at your own risk. AI-Generated Content may not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You must evaluate AI-Generated Content for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including using human review as appropriate, before using or sharing AI-Generated Content generated through the Site. By generating or using AI-Generated Content (for example, by providing content to the Site for the purpose of generating AI-Generated Content, or by adding AI-Generated Content to a job description or resume), you adopt, confirm, and ratify it. You agree that Indeed is not the author of AI-Generated Content, which may be provided by a third party.
You acknowledge and agree that none of Indeed’s AI-Generated Content, such as chatbots, are empowered to enter into, or make any changes to, any agreements on behalf of Indeed and that any decisions or actions taken by such offerings are not legally binding. Further, Indeed may not honor any benefits provided by AI-Generated Content if they are inconsistent with our policy and are not also provided elsewhere on the Site.
You agree not to use AI-Generated Content for adversarial, abusive, or other harmful purposes, including but not limited to misusing outputs to create misleading, illegal, or harmful content or testing the functionality to exploit vulnerabilities. You agree to take full responsibility for the AI-Generated Content and its use or misuse, including any inaccuracies, non-compliance with these Terms or the Site Rules, and any harm caused to you or anyone else. You agree to defend and indemnify Indeed from any claim arising from your generation or use of AI-Generated Content.

15. Claims of Infringement
U.S. Copyright Infringement. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC. § 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, Indeed Tower 200 West 6th Street, Floor 36, Austin, TX 78701, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email). We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Indeed, and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings, and agreements, written or oral. If the Job Seeker Terms, Employer Terms, or Publisher Terms apply to your use of the Site, those terms shall control in the event of an inconsistency or conflict with these Terms of Service for All Users.
Each provision of this Agreement is a separately enforceable provision. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the extent necessary in order for this Agreement to remain in effect.
This Agreement cannot be modified or amended, except by a document signed by an authorized representative of each party.

Notice to you may be effected by sending email to the email address specified in your account, or by posting a message to your account interface, and is deemed received when sent (for email) or no more than fifteen (15) days after having been posted (for messages posted to your account interface).

Except as otherwise agreed to in writing, nothing in the terms should be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationships between us and third parties.

1. Recommender Systems
Indeed uses the following information to display Job Ads in recommender systems (as defined under the DSA) and to determine the relevant prominence of Job Ads within such recommender systems: information directly provided to Indeed such as profile information and resume, prior activity on the Site, search terms and/or search location (“Main Parameters”). Prior activity on the Site means actions that you have taken on the Site, for example, previous searches, jobs that you have clicked on, jobs that you have applied to, job alert emails that you have subscribed to and companies/roles in which you have expressed an interest. To modify or influence the search results you see, you can modify your search terms.
The Main Parameters are used by Indeed to target Job Seekers with Job Ads that are most suitable for them, based on information available to Indeed. The appearance of a Job Ad on your job search results page is not a guarantee that the Job Ad is suitable for you. Indeed ranks and orders Job Ads within search results based on a combination of remuneration paid to Indeed by Employers and the Main Parameters.
In the job search results page, the most significant criteria in determining the Job Ads suggested to the Job Seeker is the search terms. We place greatest significance on this parameter in order to surface the Job Ads that are most relevant for the Job Seeker (ie, those that a Job Seeker is most likely to click on or apply to). For all other Job Ad recommendations on the Site, the criteria determining the Job Ads suggested to Job Seekers are equally significant.
In the EU, we return search results in Resume Search/Smart Sourcing based on search terms, Job Ad data, prior activity of Resume Owners on the Site and/or Resume Owner data. Resume Owner data refers to data provided by Resume Owners to Indeed, for example, their current job title and location. Prior activity of Resume Owners means actions that Resume Owners have taken on the Site, for example, jobs that Resume Owners have previously applied to or clicked on. The most significant criteria in determining the information suggested to users is search terms. These parameters are used to try to predict the probability that a Resume Owner will apply to a Job Ad and positively respond to an Employer
2. Commercial Communication
If you would like to declare that your content is or contains commercial communications, as described in the DSA, you can do so
here
. In accordance with the Terms, commercial communications are prohibited on our Site. Identifying your content as commercial communications may result in the removal of your content from our Site.
3. DSA “Advertisements”
All Job Ads are considered advertisements based on the ordinary meaning of that word. However, within the EU, the DSA states that information is an “advertisement” where it is “presented by an online platform on its online interface against remuneration specifically for promoting that information”. Therefore, as Indeed does not receive any monetary remuneration for free Job Ads, they do not constitute “advertisements” within the EU under the DSA. Within the EU, when Indeed receives remuneration specifically for promoting information, we include prominent markings identifying that information as an “advertisement.”
Employers cannot choose the main parameters Indeed uses to determine the recipient to whom a Sponsored Job is presented. Sponsored Jobs are presented to Job Seekers based on the Main Parameters set out above, and the Ad Transparency Information in each Sponsored Job reflects this.
Sponsored Jobs and Employer Branding Ads include “Ad Transparency Information”. Ad Transparency Information is generated and accurate as of the time that a user clicks on a Job Ad. The “Beneficiary” represents the natural or legal person on whose behalf the advertisement is presented. The “Sponsor” denotes the natural or legal person who paid for the advertisement, if that person is different from the Beneficiary. The Beneficiary and Sponsor are based on information available to Indeed and provided by Employers to Indeed. If you are an Employer, you confirm that all information you have provided to Indeed is accurate and complete and you agree to the publication of the employer and company name on the Site, as required by law. Within the EU, Employers shall not post a job with a confidential or generic company name.
4. Identifying and Removing Fraudulent Accounts
Indeed uses automatic and manual means to identify and remove fraudulent accounts from the Site. Indeed implements rules to automatically flag potentially risky accounts for review by its moderators, and proactively uses various tools and subject matter expertise to manually identify accounts that the automatic system may miss.
Users can also proactively identify and report potentially fraudulent accounts and all other user-generated content on the platform, including job posts, company page content, and messages. These reports are reviewed by trained moderators.
5. Moderating User-Generated Content
Indeed also uses automatic and manual means to moderate user-generated content on the site, including implementing rules to automatically flag content that may not meet the standards set out in
Indeed’s policies
and these Terms of Service. Indeed also proactively reviews user-generated content for compliance with its policies and these Terms of Service. Additionally, users can report content they deem problematic
here
. These reports are reviewed by trained moderators.
6. Complaints Procedure
If you are unhappy with a decision taken by Indeed in response to a notice of illegal content submitted by you via the
reporting portal
or a decision taken by Indeed to restrict, remove or disable access to your content;  to suspend or terminate the provision of service to you; or to suspend or terminate your account, you may submit a complaint within six months. The six-month period begins on the day you are informed of the decision you are submitting a complaint about. Indeed requires you to include the following information in your complaint form: your email address, your reference number, and the specific reasons for your complaint, including why you disagree with Indeed’s decision.
7. Misuse
Indeed may disable a user’s account, restrict a user’s ability to use all or parts of the Site, or take other action on a user’s account if the user engages in misuse of the Site. Misuse includes, but is not limited to, submitting unfounded reports of illegal content, submitting unfounded complaints, or posting illegal content. Indeed reviews instances of misuse on a case-by-case basis and considers the facts and circumstances of the misuse, including but not limited to the number of instances of misuse, the frequency of the misuse, and the gravity of the misuse.
Further terms and conditions regarding moderation of User Content are set out in Section 2 of Terms of Service for All Users above.
F. UK Online Safety Act (“OSA”)
This Section F pertains to Indeed’s operations in the United Kingdom only, and does not apply to users located elsewhere. In the event of any conflict with any other part of this Agreement, this Section F will control.
1. The Minimisation of Illegal Content on Indeed
Indeed utilizes a number of internal tools, policies, and highly trained moderators and contractors that work tirelessly to identify and prevent illegal content on the platform. While Indeed’s Trust & Safety Team is dedicated to independently mitigating illegal content on the platform, additional attention is given to illegal harms as defined by the OSA, including, but not limited to: terrorist content; hate content; and child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) content.
2. Reports of Illegal Content and Resolution of Complaints
Users are able to report content that they may believe to be illegal or against Indeed’s policies. Each instance of user-generated content, such as a job advertisement or company review, contains an option for users to file a report for that specific piece of content. Through this feature, users are able to provide information on whether they believe the content is in violation of Indeed’s policies. Content that users believe to be illegal as defined under the OSA can be submitted via a report using
this form
on the
Online Safety Page
. Each report submitted via this form will be reviewed and actioned, if necessary, within 24 hours.
Indeed’s UK Trusted Flagger Policy allows for designated UK authorities or entities to submit a report of illegal content to Indeed through a dedicated communication channel. All complaints or reports submitted via this channel are reviewed and responded to within 48 business hours.
3. Proactive Technology for Illegal Content Detection
Indeed also uses automatic and manual means to moderate user-generated content on the site, including implementing rules to automatically flag content that may not meet the standards set out in
Indeed’s policies
and these Terms of Service. Indeed also proactively reviews user-generated content for compliance with its policies and these Terms of Service. Additionally, users can report content they deem problematic
here
. These reports are reviewed by trained moderators.
Indeed Products Terms of Service
Last Updated: March 19, 2025
Indeed Ads Program Terms
You use the Ads Program when you advertise with Indeed by posting, providing, submitting, using, editing, claiming, or paying for any advertisement (“Ad”) for publication on or through the Site. Ads may be posted directly via the Site, or via campaigns, XML feeds, APIs, ATS integrations, requests to index Ads from elsewhere, or by otherwise identifying an Ad or making it available to Indeed. By posting Ads and using the Ads Program, you agree to the
Indeed Terms of Service
(the “Agreement”), including these Indeed Ads Program Terms (“IAP Terms”).
Indeed may update the Ads Program or these IAP Terms at any time without liability, and your use of the Ads Program after notice that these IAP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IAP Terms.
1. Ad Publishing
Ads may promote job listings of open employment positions (“Jobs” or “Job Ads”), hiring events or job fairs, both online or in-person (“Indeed Hiring Events”), or an Employer’s workplace generally (“Employer Branding Ads”). Ads are User Content under the Agreement, and you are granting Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees a license to use your Ads and associated data, and to display, publish, reformat, display a snippet or portion of, and host (but not change the content of) your Ads in any way Indeed or its affiliates or sublicensees see fit, including due to technical limitations. (Employers located in Japan: you agree that content moderation may result in the modification of your Job Ad.)
Ads may appear on any page, site, content, service, device, screen, app, or property chosen by Indeed in its sole discretion, whether provided by Indeed as part of the Site or Indeed Apps, or provided by a third party (“Other Sites”). Indeed has limited control over Other Sites, including their nature, content, appearance, and Ad display, and you accept any related risks of publication. Other Sites may collect or receive performance information about your Ad.
Target audience membership is based partly on information and criteria provided by the Employer, for example information provided in the Ad, but the composition of each target audience on the Site, and the frequency of publication to that audience, are determined by Indeed in its sole discretion. Indeed may have limited or no control over the display of Ads on Other Sites, including their audiences.
From time to time Indeed may add labels (such as “Urgent”, “Urgently Hiring”, “Ad”, “Paid”, “Promoted”, or “Sponsored”) when publishing an Ad. Indeed reserves the right to add, change, or remove labels at any time. When you enable labels like “Urgent” or “Urgently Hiring” for your Ad, the frequency of showing such a label on your Ad is determined by Indeed in its sole discretion. Indeed may display an estimate of the compensation associated with any Job Ad. If you do not want an estimate to be shown, you must provide Indeed with the actual compensation.
Indeed does not guarantee reach, performance, placement, or distribution of Ads, all of which may vary depending on Indeed’s consideration of various factors, such as supply and demand, industry, type of role, and sponsorship. The distribution, placement, positioning, size, and location of Ads are determined by Indeed in its sole discretion.
You agree that Indeed has no obligation to accept, host, or publish your Ad.
That decision is entirely Indeed’s in its sole discretion.
Indeed may reject or remove any Ad for any or no reason without notice.
Indeed may also pause Ad campaigns without notice. For examples of why Job Ads from Employers may be rejected, refer to
Indeed Job Posting Standards
.
Indeed further reserves the right to include or reject any or all Job Ads from a job board. Generally, job boards may only post Job Ads on their own behalf as an Employer. A job board may only post Job Ads on its clients’ behalf if they conform to the
Job Board Inclusion Guidelines
, which also give examples of why Job Ads from job boards may be rejected. Attempts to violate the Guidelines may result in limiting or disabling your account. The determination as to whether you are a job board is made by Indeed in its sole discretion, and such decision is binding. Indeed further reserves the right to reject any Job Ads which advertise staffing opportunities or platforms rather than jobs.
You acknowledge that inclusion of Ads that violate these IAP Terms or Indeed policies or standards may harm Indeed and its users. Although Indeed may indicate why an Ad has been removed, we cannot give every reason why, and we always retain the right to remove any Ad if we feel it is in the interest of users or Indeed. The Indeed team responsible for maintaining the quality of the Site is independent, and its decisions are final and not subject to review.
To post a Job Ad at no additional cost, post it through the Site without setting a budget, or otherwise decline the option to sponsor. When you post a free Ad, that Ad will be visible on the Site for a limited time and may automatically pause once the time or application limit is reached. As described below, please note that Indeed may require an Ad to be sponsored, or limit the number of free Ads you are allowed to post, for any or no reason in Indeed’s sole discretion, including to benefit Job Seekers, to verify the legitimacy of the Ad or the Employer, to prevent abuse of the free to post system, or to improve the Site.
Performance, cost, budget, and other data related to your unclaimed indexed Job Ad on the Site is available to anyone who claims the Job Ad or feed. It is your responsibility to claim your Job Ads and feeds, and to alert Indeed in case of an inaccuracy.
Employer Branding Ads
, formerly known as
Indeed Targeted Ads.
Employer Branding Ads may be sponsored (generally Pay Per Impression), and Indeed may in its sole discretion include Employer Branding Ads at no additional cost when you sponsor a Job Ad. Employer Branding Ads are also provided on the Glassdoor platform, and subject to the
Glassdoor Terms of Use
, except that these IAP Terms will govern in the event of a conflict. By using Employer Branding Ads, you agree to the
Glassdoor Terms of Use
.
Indeed Hiring Events.
When you post an Indeed Hiring Event, you are asking Indeed to manage the Ad campaign, distributing its budget among our different pricing models in our sole discretion. You will be charged in accordance with the selected pricing model(s) and any applicable subscription fee. Posting an Indeed Hiring Event may require a minimum advertising budget. You are also asking Indeed to send emails or text messages related to your event to users who RSVP to your event, such as in case of event cancellation, though delivery is not guaranteed.
You are solely responsible for all aspects of your hiring event, whether participating or hosting, including your Ad and hiring process, the event’s timing, location, accessibility, security, and attendance, signage, documentation, reviewing Job Seeker qualifications, verifying information, screening applicants, and responding to requests for accommodation.
Tracking Pixels.
Indeed may permit you to include tracking pixels in Ads. This functionality is provided solely as a courtesy, and Indeed may disable any tracking pixel at any time. Indeed provides no warranty regarding the proper functioning of a pixel, any numbers reported, or that use of a pixel would be error-free. You are advised not to rely on the pixel. Tracking pixels are for convenience only, and may not be used to profile users, for behavioral analytics, or to dispute Indeed’s advertising charges. You are solely responsible for your tracking pixels, and Indeed disclaims all liability related to such use. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, including applicable privacy and data protection laws, and to defend and indemnify Indeed from any claim arising from your use of tracking pixels.
Integrations
.
Indeed may support or offer functionality by which an Employer may monitor progress through parts of their hiring process, such as a conversion tracker or ATS integration (“Integrations”). Integrations send data to Indeed about applications originating on the Site, including completion of an application, contacts, interviews, and hiring decisions. This data is User Content under the Agreement.  Integrations involving Indeed’s Sponsored Jobs API may also allow Employers to automate the sponsorship of Job Ads. By accessing or using the Sponsored Jobs API, you or your End User may incur a charge whenever your or your End User’s monthly spend to sponsor Job Ads via monthly campaign(s) is less than the calculated total monthly cost of using the API as determined by Indeed and indicated on the Site, in the Documentation (including in the Indeed Developer Portal), or as otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. Spend on Job Ads sponsored with daily budgets is not considered when determining if you or your End User will incur a charge. Charges are solely based on Indeed’s measurements, and Indeed’s measurements shall be binding. Any connections to an Indeed API are subject to the
Indeed API Terms
in the Agreement.
Integrations are provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and without warranty. Indeed disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Integrations. Your installation and use of an Integration must be in accordance with all applicable laws, including providing any necessary disclosures and obtaining any necessary consent or agreement.
2. Ad Sponsorship
An Ad can be sponsored using tools on the Site or an integration with Indeed such as your ATS, or through a campaign, including Sponsored Jobs. “Sponsor” means you are paying Indeed to advertise and publish the Ad, and you are requesting that Indeed manage your Ad campaign using automated tools for Ad placement and bid optimization, for exposure and visibility on the Site and Other Sites. This management is in Indeed’s sole discretion and is provided without warranty as to placement or visibility of any Ad.
Sponsorship is not a guarantee that the Ad will be published at any particular time or place, or displayed more prominently or frequently than other Ads.
Sponsorship means Indeed exercising its judgment and discretion in publishing the Ad, to achieve what Indeed determines is the most appropriate visibility for the Ad and budget.
The price to sponsor an Ad is measured by user activity, such as impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPS, or Started Applications. You are not buying these clicks or other actions themselves; they are only different ways to measure the advertising service Indeed provides.
Indeed may require a minimum Ad budget to sponsor a Job Ad or to post an Indeed Hiring Event. A campaign to sponsor multiple Job Ads may also require a minimum spend per Job Ad.
Prices vary based on many factors, including supply and demand of Ads, impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPs, Started Applications, Applications, internet traffic, time of day or year, job title, and job location.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s measurements of user activity, including impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPs or Started Applications. Indeed’s measurements of such activity shall be binding.
Indeed’s measurements may include and rely on data from third parties, including vendors and Other Sites, over which Indeed has limited control or knowledge.
You agree that Indeed has no obligation to accept, host, or publish your Ad.
That decision is entirely Indeed’s in its sole discretion, regardless of sponsorship.
Indeed may reject or remove any Ad for any or no reason without notice.
Once removed, an Ad does not receive impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPs, Started Applications, or Applications.
Indeed may require an Ad to be sponsored, for any or no reason in Indeed’s sole discretion, including to benefit Job Seekers, to verify the legitimacy of the Ad or the Employer, to prevent abuse of the free to post system, or to improve the Site. For example, sponsorship may be required for identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs (including similar jobs) re-posted after an initial time period, jobs that have reached the free application or Ad time limit on the Site, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission-only, or hard-to-fill jobs. Except for in Japan, sponsorship is required for any Job Ad that you post directly on the Site if any of your jobs already get organic visibility through being aggregated or indexed to the Site from sources such as a data feed (e.g. XML, API), your career site, your company site, or ATS. Except for in Japan, Ad sponsorship is required for jobs posted by a staffing agency, recruitment process outsourcer, or other recruitment-based company.
You may have the option to sponsor an Ad at a premium budget specified on the Site for access to certain features as specified on the Site.
You are solely responsible for reviewing and selecting appropriate features for your Ad and for all optional targeting features you choose
, including targeting that allows your Ad to appear in the approximate geographic locations that you select and to an audience based on relevant job criteria that you select. Certain optional targeting features are based on user provided information, and Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such information. You are not required to use any optional features, and as applicable, may opt-in to or opt-out of usage of those features. Unless otherwise stated on the Site, your Ad budget will not change by opting out of any optional features.
3. Budget and Pricing Models
Ad campaigns can be sponsored under different pricing models, described below. Each sponsored Ad will incur a charge upon the associated user action, until its budget is depleted or you pause or close the Ad. For example, one Job Ad campaign may be charged per click, while another campaign may be charged per Started Application. This activity may happen on the Site, Indeed Apps, or Other Sites.
Pricing is indicated on the Site or an Insertion Order. When you start, edit, or change a sponsored Job Ad campaign or plan, the pricing models available to you may vary. Indeed reserves the right to offer different pricing models at different times in different circumstances, in limited quantities, in limited locations, and for a limited time, or to set any pricing model as default. Prices and pricing models may vary between different Ads, or between the same Ad posted at different times or locations (such as when a campaign is closed and later reopened). If you do not select a pricing model for a sponsored Ad campaign, Indeed may select one.
It is your responsibility to monitor your Ad campaigns, select the appropriate pricing model and budget for each campaign, and manage their budgets.
You can pause, unpause, or close your Ads at any time.
You can also change your Ad budget at any time. When you change your Ad budget, your access to sponsored job features may change accordingly. For example, by decreasing your Ad budget below the premium budget specified on the Site, you will lose access to certain features that are only available by maintaining the specified budget. A budget or spending limit you set for one Ad campaign is for that type of campaign only, and does not limit how much you will spend on other campaigns or other services. For example, the budget and limits for Pay Per Started Application campaigns will not apply to a Pay Per Click campaign.
If your written Insertion Order does not contain an end date, your campaign will run, and you will continue to be billed, until you contact Indeed to cancel.
Indeed may provide budget recommendations and performance estimates for a given budget (such as expected visibility or clicks), or other predictions related to your Ad. This data is provided “as is,” without warranty, and does not guarantee performance or visibility, or interaction with your Ad or job.
Pricing Models
Pay Per Impression.
You will be charged based on impression count. An impression generally occurs when your Ad appears on a page or screen which has been presented to a user. Delivery of an impression does not guarantee any level of viewership of your Ad or interaction with your job. Impression data may rely on third parties like Other Sites, who may measure impressions differently from each other.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s impression measurements. Indeed’s impression count shall be binding.
Pay Per Click
, also known as
Daily Budget.
You will be charged based on click count. Clicks can be on Ads or on other content such as messages and notifications. Your dashboard will reflect the total click count.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s click count. Indeed’s click count shall be binding.
Pay Per Started RSVP.
You will be charged when a user takes the first step to RSVP to your Hiring Event (a “Started RSVP”), including clicking on a button or link to start or continue an RSVP. A Started RSVP is considered complete even if the user does not proceed further, and does not guarantee they will complete an RSVP or attend a Hiring Event.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s Started RSVP measurements. Indeed’s Started RSVP count shall be binding.
Pay Per RSVP.
You will be charged for each RSVP to your Hiring Event. An RSVP is defined as a user completing the online RSVP form agreeing to attend your Event. An RSVP does not guarantee that a Job Seeker will attend your Event.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s RSVP measurements. Indeed’s RSVP count shall be binding.
Pay Per Started Application.
You will be charged when a user takes the first step of applying to your job (a “Started Application”). A Started Application includes: 1) a click on a button or link to start or continue an application; 2) interacting with a chatbot, QR code, or other method to start or continue an application; 3) a click on a button or link to schedule an interview; and 4) a click on a Sponsored Job ad on a third party website, which leads to the Indeed Apply page. A Started Application is considered complete even if the user does not proceed further, and does not guarantee they will complete an application.
Charges are solely based on Indeed’s Started Application measurements. Indeed’s Started Application count shall be binding.
4. Billing and Payment
Indeed may charge the credit card, or bank account information on file for your account. You will be charged upon the earlier of (a) your Ad campaign spending $500.00 or more or (b) the beginning of the next calendar month after you sponsor your Ad. If you previously sponsored Pay Per Click Ads on the same account, you may also be charged once your Job Ad campaign spends $25.00. For an Ad campaign, or the purchase of products or services of more than $500 per month, you may be charged multiple times a month. If you do not provide a payment method for a Sponsored Job campaign, the campaign will not begin and your Ad will not be visible, though Indeed may in its sole discretion remove the budget and post the Ad with organic visibility.
Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail. Your payment must be in accordance with the Payment section in the Terms for All Users section of the Agreement. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 120 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). You are responsible for paying all expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. Refunds (if any) are in accordance with the Refunds section in the Terms for All Users section of the Agreement. If you are removed from the Site, but have previously spent on the Site, you are not entitled to a refund of previously spent amounts.
Charges are exclusive of all taxes, including VAT. You are responsible for all taxes and government charges as applicable and appropriate. All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefor. (If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed services.)
Your credit card, bank account, and related billing and payment information may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors or credit agencies, for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed, and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information.
5. Conditions and Prohibited Uses
Your use of the Ads Program is permitted on the condition that you adhere to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including these IAP Terms, the Agreement, the Site Rules, Privacy Policy, and instructions on the Site and Indeed Apps. Violation may result in restrictions on your account, termination of your account and the Agreement, and legal penalties and consequences. Indeed terms and policies may be modified at any time.
You are responsible for all information you provide or request that Indeed publish, whether through the Site or otherwise, and whether generated by or for you, in any medium, including text, image, mark, logo, video, or audio, all which is considered User Content under the Agreement. Indeed relies on the accuracy of the information you provide. You must notify Indeed immediately if you notice any inaccuracy.
You accept sole responsibility for: (a) User Content provided by, attributable to, or associated with you, including Ad content, job descriptions, screener questions, and target URLs; (b) websites reachable from target URLs or your Ad; and (c) ensuring that your use of the Ads Program, the Site, and Indeed Apps are lawful and will not cause Indeed to violate any applicable law. Indeed’s publication of your Ad, or reformatting or addition of labels during publication (such as “Powered by Indeed”) does not alter your responsibility.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the right and authority to use the Program, including to provide or claim your Ads and job feed; (ii) all information you provide (through the Site or otherwise) is true, correct, and current; (iii) you hold and grant Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees all rights to use, copy, distribute, and display your User Content; and (iv) such use and websites linked from your Ads will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable law.
You shall not cause, authorize, or contribute to: (1) automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid Site activity such as impressions, clicks, Started RSVPs, RSVPs, Started Applications, or Applications; (2) manipulation of Ad placement, bidding, or any other part of the Site or Indeed Apps; (3) inaccurate reporting of any measurements of user activity including applications; (4) circumventing charges you owe to Indeed, such as by preventing the reporting of an application; (5) advertisement of goods or services through the Site; or (6) anything unlawful or fraudulent. Indeed reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate accounts suspected of such activity without notice, and to take corresponding legal action.
Indeed may choose not to accept any Ads for any or no reason.Indeed further reserves the right to disable or terminate any Employer’s account, for any or no reason, without notice
. Although Indeed may provide information related to our decision-making process, we cannot give every reason why an account may be terminated or an Ad may be removed. The Indeed team responsible for maintaining the quality of the Site is independent, and its decisions are final and not subject to review.

Indeed Resume Search/Smart Sourcing Program Terms
These Indeed Resume Search Program Terms or Indeed CV Search Program Terms or Smart Sourcing Terms (collectively, “IRSP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the
Indeed Terms of Service
(the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer that accesses or uses the Indeed Resume Search also known as “Smart Sourcing” offering, or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these IRSP Terms. By agreeing to the IRSP Terms, you also agree to the
Indeed Terms of Service
.
Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IRSP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
1. The Program
Use of the Indeed Resume Search Program/CV Search Program, also known as “Smart Sourcing” (“Program” or “IRSP”) by an individual / Job Seeker who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, “Resume Owner”) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, on the subscription or plan purchase page, and on the FAQ and information page(s) for the country you are purchasing a subscription or plan for, any or all of which may be modified at any time. You agree and acknowledge that the Program pricing and offerings are subject to change. Purchasing additional subscriptions or plans, or modifying subscriptions or plans may reset the monthly billing date for subscriptions or plans associated with your account, resulting in pro rata charges to account for the new date. If you purchase a new plan in India during the duration of your current plan, the new plan will begin after your current plan ends. You shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners or other individuals, through the Site, for purposes of filling your Job Listings. You shall not use the Indeed Resume Search Program for  any directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, or fraudulent purpose. You are solely responsible for your use of the Program, including but not limited to, how you search for Job Seekers, who you decide to contact, and any employment related decisions you make. Please note that contacts expire six months from the date of subscription purchase. Contacts that you receive via a special offer expire six months from the date you redeem that offer, unless otherwise stated in the offer. Contact information provided by Indeed, including any Relay Service email address, is for your individual use only and may not be shared with any other person. You are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a resume, in order to circumvent the resume contact system. Use of such a product or system will result in your immediate termination from the Program. In addition, as a feature of the Program, Indeed may send emails to Resume Owners on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for their resume. In some circumstances, Indeed may limit the number and/or frequency of times you may contact a Resume Owner or any individual through the Site. For example, if you contact a Resume Owner, and the Resume Owner does not express interest or contact you back, you may not be able to contact them again for a period of time.
IMPORTANT NOTICE : YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: in purchasing or obtaining access to the Program, you are paying Indeed the amount indicated on the Site for the purpose of Indeed facilitating your contact with a Resume Owner by sending a message to the email address that the relevant Resume Owner has provided to Indeed, or by connecting you via phone call to the number provided by the Resume Owner. Your use of the Program is subject to all Indeed Site Rules and policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and any policies pertaining to Relay Services. Indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message will be received, read, or acted upon by any potential Resume Owner or job seeker, or that any individual or Resume Owner’s resume or information thereof is valid, accurate or complete in any respect.
Indeed may return different results for the same resume search query and has full discretion with respect to the resumes or profiles it presents in response to any particular search.
Indeed does not allow its Program, including but not limited to, resume contact service to be used in a spam like manner, and you expressly agree not to use the Program service in such manner. Indeed defines “spam like manner” as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by Indeed experience and/or Resume Owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role or who have indicated that such requests are unwanted. Indeed reserves the right to disable Indeed Resume Search contact service for any user who, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates these IRSP Terms, including the foregoing term. We reserve the right to drop any message, including without limitation dropping any message with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .so, .dll, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment or any other attachment containing scripts, macros, or other code, or other messages that Indeed suspects to be malicious or spam, or for any or no reason.
The only acceptable use of the Program is for you to contact a Resume Owner or individual through the Site regarding a Job Listing or potential employment. No other uses of the Program are permitted.
Scraping or data mining the Indeed Resume Search database, which may include any Job Seeker Resume, or using the Indeed Resume Search or “Smart Sourcing” database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you. We may in our sole discretion place limits on your ability to run searches using the Program if we suspect that your use may adversely affect Indeed’s system, you are using the Program in a malicious or objectionable manner, or you have violated this Agreement. Additionally, if you are a competitor of Indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) you may not use the Indeed Program or Resume Search or Smart Sourcing database to contact a Resume Owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients, and any such competitive use of the Program or Indeed Resume Search or Smart Sourcing database may result in Indeed blocking you from the Site, blocking you from contacting Resume Owners, and blocking your contact emails to those Resume Owners without notice and you consent to the same. Indeed may limit the number of devices each account is logged into. Each Resume or Smart Sourcing subscription or plan is solely for the individual use of the person to whom it is assigned, and may not be shared with other users. If you have a plan in India, you agree that adding seats to the plan does not add additional contacts to the subscription plan; if you add a seat on a day after the subscription plan has started, the price you pay for that seat is prorated, however, the number of contacts remains unaffected. For plans in India, once the time period on your subscription plan expires, so will any remaining contacts; no unused contacts will carry over to your new plan.
In the event phone numbers are provided by the Resume Owner in the resume, Indeed does not guarantee their validity and cannot confirm whether such numbers are landlines or cell phones. You agree to call Resume Owner regarding relevant job opportunities only. It is your sole responsibility to comply with all TCPA guidelines, as well as other laws against automated telephone dialling systems or laws governing phone or mobile communications in your applicable jurisdiction.
Information contained in Resume Owner resumes is self-reported by Job Seekers, may be outdated or inaccurate, and is not verified by Indeed. Any filtering, sorting, matching, or ranking tools available to you as part of the Program rely on this Job Seeker-provided information and/or information you provide to Indeed about your job requirements or preferences. The appearance of a given Job Seeker’s resume in search results or as a match is not a guarantee that the Resume Owner has the attributes or experience you have selected or that they would be interested in a job. When you use the Program, Indeed does not guarantee that you will see desirable, or any, search results in response to each query or that you will see desirable, or any, daily matches. You are solely responsible for determining or verifying any Resume Owner provided information or any publicly available information, including whether a Resume Owner / Job Seeker has a certain license, certification, or security clearance.
In a product on the Site, you may see a verification of a Job Seeker’s skills, certifications, or other qualifications.  Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of such verifications or information, and you are solely responsible for verifying information on the Site.
In the United States, Indeed may make publicly available information aggregated from various sources searchable by third parties (like Employers) through the Program. We make that information available on a limited basis and for a limited time to help Employers find and connect with potential job seekers about an Employer’s Job Listings or job opportunities, and such information may not be used for any other purpose. You may remove your publicly available information from the Program and unsubscribe from receiving potential job opportunities from Employers by following the unsubscribe link in our messages. To delete your publicly available information from our Site, submit this
form
.
2. Cancellation
Once you have requested that Indeed contact a Resume Owner, you may not revoke such request. Cancellation of your use of the Program shall be in accordance with any cancellation policies listed on the Site.
When you cancel or downgrade your subscription or plan, your access to the Program features will change accordingly. For example, you will lose access to features that are exclusive to the higher subscription or plan.
Indeed reserves the right to cancel any subscription at any time and for any or no reason. Indeed may immediately cancel, update or modify the Program or these IRSP Terms in our sole discretion at any time without liability and your use of the Program after notice that the Program or these IRSP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IRSP Terms. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IRSP Terms.
3. Your Information
You represent and warrant that all information you provide to Indeed is correct and current. You represent to Indeed that you are an Employer interested in considering the Resume Owner as a potential employee.
4. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, SERVICE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. YOU USE THE SITE AND THE PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK. INDEED DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SITE OR PROGRAM WILL ALWAYS BE ERROR FREE, SAFE, OR SECURE.
EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 HEREUNDER AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTION 1, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE PROGRAM TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE PROGRAM TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU FOR THE INDEED RESUME SEARCH SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
5. Payment
You shall be charged if, and as, indicated by the Site. Upon your request, Indeed may in its sole discretion pause your subscription or plan and associated cost, and upon Indeed unpausing the subscription or plan, it will continue for the remaining term until it expires and automatically renews. Details regarding the resume subscription plan are available on the Site. If your billing address is in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US Dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the
Asia-Pacific Region*
, you may only pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and US Dollars. If your billing address is anywhere else, you may be able to pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euro, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, Mexican Pesos, or Japanese Yen. This choice of currencies will be fully subject to Indeed’s discretion. Charges are exclusive of taxes, including VAT. You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 120 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODIC ALLOTMENTS UNDER THE APPLICABLE RESUME SUBSCRIPTION OR PLAN. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of credit for Indeed services. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card, bank account, and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore. Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail, unless otherwise specified by Indeed. Except for plans in India, if you purchase a subscription or plan, you acknowledge and agree that your subscription or plan will automatically renew and Indeed will charge you on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription or plan and such cancellation goes into effect, which may not be until the next billing cycle. Pausing your subscription or plan does not cancel it. Your subscription will continue to automatically renew after being unpaused. The applicable billing cycle (e.g. monthly or annual, etc.) will depend upon the terms agreed upon.
6. Indemnification
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of your use of the Program, including but not limited to, how you conduct the search, any contact you have with the recipient (or intended recipient), any email you request to be sent pursuant to these Program Terms, any phone call or text message you make to a recipient, and activities of any third party service provider you engage to facilitate your sourcing activities through the Program, such as an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).
Indeed API Terms
These Indeed API terms (“API Terms”) and any related documentation (“Documentation”), form a part of, and are incorporated into, the
Indeed Terms of Service
, and apply to anyone who accesses or uses an Application Programming Interface created or maintained by Indeed (“API”), develops any application that communicates or interoperates with any API, the Site, or any Indeed service (“Application”), or who otherwise indicates acceptance of these API Terms. By accessing or using any API or Documentation or by otherwise accepting these API Terms, you agree to these API terms and to the
Indeed Terms of Service
(the “Agreement”), including the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using, and all of Indeed’s policies, including the
Indeed Privacy Policy
and
Indeed Cookie Policy
. By using any Indeed API on behalf of an entity like an Employer, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to these API Terms, and by accepting these API Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity. Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these API Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
“Applicable Data Protection Law” means all laws, regulations, and other legal requirements relating to (i) privacy, data security, consumer protection, marketing, promotion, and text messaging, email, and other communications; (ii) the use, collection, retention, storage, security, disclosure, transfer, disposal, and other processing of Personal Data applicable to the processing of Client Personal Data under the Agreement including but not limited to General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), Federal Data Protection Act of 19 June 1992 (Switzerland), UK Data Protection Act 2018 and UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Act No. 57 of 2003 as amended in 2015) and any US state or federal laws or regulations pertaining to the collection, use, disclosure, security or protection of personal data, or to security breach notification, e.g. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (together the “CCPA”); and binding guidance and / or codes of practice issued by a competent supervisory authority under applicable laws (as defined in the GDPR), or the European Data Protection Board.

“End User” means an entity, such as an Employer client (or you if you build or use the Integration for your own use), that uses any Integration or Indeed API.
“Indeed Confidential Information” includes, but is not limited to, the APIs, Documentation, APIs Key, Indeed Marks, Indeed Applications, click through rates, performance statistics, advertising rates, revenue share rates and all information related thereto.
“Integration” means the working connection between your Application and Indeed API/s that allows for the exchange of information as described and permitted under the Documentation.

This definition shall adjust as necessary to include data defined as “Personal Information”, “Personally Identifiable Information”, and similar terms under Applicable Data Protection Laws.
1.  The APIs
Indeed may provide you with access to one or more APIs, as well as any accompanying Documentation, solely for your internal business use in developing and using Applications or for Indeed to process and analyze submitted information and behavioral data in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy. Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims any and all liability for the accuracy, content, completeness, legality, reliability, operability or availability of information or material on or through any API. For the most up to date and accurate information, use the Site directly.
Your license is subject to and conditioned on your compliance with all terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, and it is revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable. No implied license is granted. Indeed reserves all rights that are not expressly granted by this Agreement.
You may develop an Application that interoperates with an Indeed API for the use of your employees or independent contractors for your internal business purposes. Your and End Users’ use of an API or Application to access the Site or any Indeed App is subject to the applicable Terms of Service for the Site or Indeed App, and you agree to require your End Users to accept and comply with such Terms of Service as well as these API Terms. You agree that you will be responsible for your End Users’ use of your Application and any API.
It is also you and your End Users’ responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App or the Site in order to obtain the most up-to-date information (including, but not limited to, explanations about how features work, disclaimers and disclosures regarding the services provided, method for charging) about Indeed’s products and services. By using an Application or Applicant Tracking System (“ATS”) via an API, rather than directly using the Site or an Indeed App, you agree to all information provided on the Site or an Indeed App. Use of an Application or ATS via an API, rather than direct use of the Site or an Indeed App, shall not excuse any lack of information or understanding about Indeed’s products and services, where that information is otherwise provided on the Site or an Indeed App.
You agree that Indeed may monitor your and End Users’ use of any API and may process and analyze submitted information and behavioral data in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy. This monitoring may include Indeed accessing and using your Application. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Indeed may use any technical means to overcome such interference. You agree that when you or End Users’ use an ATS via an API, such ATS may access, monitor, process, or analyze submitted information and behavioral data. If you, or anyone on your behalf, send or receive communication via API (including by sending or receiving communication to/from an email address aliased by Indeed and/or by using a different email address from the one associated with your account), you agree to the communication being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service.
You agree to promptly notify Indeed in advance of your decision to discontinue use of any APIs that allow Indeed to process and analyze submitted information and behavioral data.
By using Indeed’s API you understand and agree to periodic audits of your usage. Indeed will request, and you will provide (or cause your agent to provide), your data usage metrics in order for Indeed to review. If Indeed finds you have violated these guidelines, your use of Indeed’s API may be restricted or terminated.
Indeed may update, modify or discontinue the API at any time and in our sole discretion and without liability to you, and may require you to obtain and use the most recent version. You are required to update your Application accordingly at your sole expense. You acknowledge that Indeed’s update to an API may adversely affect how your Application communicates with the Site or an Indeed App, and you agree that Indeed will have no liability therefrom. Your use of an API after an update by Indeed constitutes acceptance of the update. Indeed reserves the right to develop products or services that are similar to, or may compete with, any Application.
2. Limitations, Restrictions and Security
Accessing and using the Site or any Indeed App through an API is subject to the Site Rules, these API Terms, and any additional rules, guidelines, and policies made available by Indeed. Such additional rules, guidelines, or policies may be detailed in the Documentation (including in the
Indeed Developer Portal
), these API Terms, or otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. For example, by using the Indeed Apply API in connection with your Job Listings, you agree not to require or otherwise burden a Job Seeker to submit a duplicate application through other means if that Job Seeker already applied to your Job Listing using Indeed Apply. You further agree to accurately describe to a Job Seeker what information and data you collect from and about that Job Seeker when they apply to your job using Indeed Apply, including how you handle and share such information and data. You also agree to honor a Job Seeker request for their information and data that you collect in connection with any API. Further, by using the Indeed Apply API, you agree to use HTTPS POST URL(s).
You agree to do all the following in connection with your access and use of any API or development or use of any Application: (a) comply with the Agreement, the API terms, the Site Rules, all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and all guidelines, standards, and requirements that may be made available to you by Indeed (including those stated in the
Indeed Developer Portal
); (b) monitor the use of your Applications for any activity that violates these API terms; (c) promptly restrict any End Users who violate these API Terms from further use of your Application; and (d) promptly notify Indeed of any violation of these API Terms by you or End Users.
You acknowledge and agree that Indeed sets and enforces limits on your use of and access to any API (including by limiting the number of API calls or API requests you may make or the number of users you may serve). Indeed monitors usage of the APIs to enforce these limits, in its sole discretion. Such limits may be detailed in the Documentation or otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. When you reach those limits, Indeed will restrict or terminate your API access or API Key at any time and without prior notice.
Access to the Sponsored Jobs API is limited to users and End Users who actively spend to sponsor a Job Ad through a monthly campaign. When you or your End User do not actively spend to sponsor a Job Ad through a monthly campaign, you agree that your and your End User’s access to the Sponsored Jobs API will be disabled or terminated without prior notice. You agree that you or your End User (whoever is the billing entity on record accessing the API) shall be charged for each call or request that you make to the Sponsored Jobs API if, and as, indicated on the Site, in the Documentation (including in the Indeed Developer Portal), or as otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. By accessing or using the Sponsored Jobs API, you or your End User may incur a charge whenever your or your End User’s monthly spend to sponsor Job Ads via monthly campaign(s) is less than the calculated total monthly cost of using the API as determined by Indeed and indicated on the Site, in the Documentation (including in the Indeed Developer Portal), or as otherwise communicated to you by Indeed. Spend on Job Ads sponsored with daily budgets is not considered when determining if you or your End User will incur a charge. Charges are solely based on Indeed’s measurements, and Indeed’s measurements shall be binding. It is your and your End Users’ responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App, the Site, or Documentation (which may be updated from time to time at Indeed’s sole discretion) to obtain the most up to date information regarding payment and how Indeed charges you or your End User for your use or your End User’s use of Indeed’s products and services, including any API.
You agree that neither you, your Application, nor your End Users, will do any of the following in connection with your access or use of any API or development or use of any Application: (a) violate any Site Rule or other rule or policy pertaining to the Site, or any applicable law or regulation; (b) copy, duplicate, modify, or create derivative works of an API, in whole or in part; (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to any source code component of any API; (d) remove any proprietary notices from any materials available through any API; (e) make an API or Application available to a third party except as permitted by a written agreement with Indeed; (f) circumvent any limits on API access imposed by Indeed; (g) scrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of any User Content, except as expressly permitted by the Documentation or Indeed; or (h) modify, misrepresent, or otherwise manipulate data provided by any API.
When reporting Indeed data provided by any API, you agree to accurately represent such data. You agree that such data shall not include: (a) blended third-party fees, including fees from the entity calling the API; (b) data from third parties such as other advertising providers; or (c) sponsored data blended with organic data. If using an API to provide Indeed services to an Employer, you agree to provide accurate reporting to the Employer about the services obtained through the use of the API and the value that the services provided represent. You agree to report data to Employers in an accurate, organized and digestible manner that allows Employers to filter and sort categories of data such as clicks, apply starts, costs of Indeed services isolated from other service providers’ costs including your own, and other metrics.
You agree to provide and adhere to a Privacy Policy for your Application that accurately describes to End Users and/or Job Seekers what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Indeed and other third parties. You further agree to protect all such information in accordance with applicable laws, and not to access or use such information (especially personal data) except as required to provide Indeed services to an Employer through your Application.
If you use or access any Indeed API or Documentation to provide Indeed services to an Employer, you acknowledge and agree that you will not access personal data (as defined by applicable Data Protection law) to provide Indeed services to an Employer. However, if you have received personal data from Indeed that is not required to provide Indeed services to an Employer, you shall notify Indeed and return or destroy such personal data (as instructed by Indeed). Should you and Indeed agree that you will process personal data in connection with providing Indeed services, your general responsibilities (regarding the nature and purpose of access, security controls and protocols, international transfer of data, etc.) will be set forth in a Data Processing Addendum.
Security Measures.
The Site, APIs and Applications may contain technological measures designed to prevent unauthorized or illegal use of the Indeed properties. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Indeed may use these and other lawful measures to verify your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the API Terms, and enforce Indeed’s rights, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Indeed Applications and APIs; (ii) Indeed may deny anyone access to and/or use of the Site, APIs or Applications; and (iii) Indeed and its representatives may collect, maintain, process, and use diagnostic, technical, usage, and related information, including information about your computers, systems and software, that Indeed may gather in the course of providing the APIs, Indeed Applications or the Site. This information will be treated in accordance with the
Indeed Terms of Service
and
Privacy Policy
, as amended from time to time; and (iv) you shall employ no less than industry-standard best practices with regard to protecting access to Indeed APIs and Indeed Confidential Information, and shall maintain data security and disaster avoidance policies and procedures designed to safeguard Indeed APIs, data and Indeed Confidential Information.
Security Standards
. You shall maintain security practices that: (i) include adequate and appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, including underlying operating system and network security controls and, (ii) are designed to meet or exceed industry-standard best practices and, (iii) comply with Indeed’s information security policies to the extent disclosed in writing to you. Such security practices shall include without limitation: (i) continuous monitoring for security threats and security incidents and, (ii) use of firewalls and real-time intrusion detection systems, encryption and other secure technologies to collect, store and/or transmit Indeed data and, (iii) application of physical security procedures, including security guards, and regular monitoring of all areas in which Indeed data is stored or Indeed APIs or Applications accessed and, (iv) restriction on access to Indeed APIs and Applications, and copying of Indeed data on a “need-to-know” basis and only at authorized locations and, (v) performance of background checks on your personnel with access to Indeed APIs, Applications or data and, (vi) ensuring regular monitoring of password procedures used to gain access to Indeed APIs, Applications or data and, (vii) application of VPN and dual-factor authentication for your corporate systems and, (viii) having in place system(s) to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
Security Records and Audit.
While using the APIs or Applications, and for one (1) year thereafter, you shall: (i) maintain complete and accurate records relating to your data protection practices and the security of and access to Indeed APIs, Applications, data and Confidential Information, including any backup, disaster recovery or other policies, practices or procedures and, (ii) upon Indeed’s request, make all such records, appropriate personnel and relevant materials available during normal business hours for inspection and audit by Indeed and/or its designee(s). Indeed shall give you at least fifteen (15) days prior notice of any audit, undertake audits no more than once per calendar year (or more frequently for a good cause shown), and conduct any audit in a manner designed to minimize disruption of your normal business operations. The foregoing limitations shall not apply to any audit in connection with the unauthorized disclosure of or access to Indeed APIs, Applications, data or Confidential Information.
Data Breaches
. You must immediately report any suspected or actual security or data breach (as defined under applicable laws) involving Indeed APIs, Applications, data or Confidential information. You shall promptly take all necessary corrective actions, and shall cooperate with Indeed in all reasonable and lawful efforts to prevent, mitigate, or rectify a data breach. You shall also provide Indeed reasonable access to the related reports and documentation needed to understand the cause of the security or data breach. Except as prohibited by applicable law, the content of any filings, communications, notices, press releases or reports related to data breach related to Indeed must be prepared in cooperation with Indeed before any publication or communication thereof.
Harmful Code.
You shall not transmit to Indeed or upload to or through the Integrations any Harmful Code, or use or misappropriate the Integrations for your own commercial gain or any other reason. Indeed reserves the right to use a variety of methods to detect, block and screen the above anomalous activity and to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud. Such measures may result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of your access to the Indeed APIs, Applications or your Integrations, or of your use of any other functions of the Indeed APIs, Applications or your Integrations with or without notice. Indeed shall not be responsible or liable for any such suspension or termination, including any consequences thereof. Indeed reserves the right to delete any message from you with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment for any or no reason.
3. Access and API Key
You agree to only access an API by the means described in its Documentation. To call or otherwise access or use an API, Indeed requires that you follow its registration and implementation process, including providing information about your Application and a current contact person with whom Indeed can communicate with about your Application or API access and use. Indeed requires that you use a password, key or other security device to access an API (“API Key”). Instructions for obtaining an API Key are included in the applicable Documentation. You are responsible for all access to and use of the API under your API Key. You agree to maintain the confidentiality and security of your API Key, to not share it with any third party, and use it only in compliance with these API Terms. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your Application’s identity. The decision to grant you API access or access to an API Key is entirely in Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed may restrict or terminate your API access or API Key at any time.
4.  Intellectual Property
You understand and acknowledge that Indeed or its affiliates, or its or their licensors, owns all right title and interest to the API, the Site, and Indeed Apps, and all proprietary rights associated therewith. Indeed reserves all rights not specifically granted herein. You shall not modify any copyright notices, proprietary legends, any trademark and service mark attributions, any patent markings, or other indicia of ownership on the materials accessed through the API, other than your User Content.
If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we may use such information without obligation to you.
You acknowledge that User Content as defined in the Agreement may be available via the APIs, and that User Content is the sole responsibility of the person who provided it to Indeed.
5.  Data Protection
You acknowledge that you or Indeed may provide or otherwise make available to the other party Personal Data for the purposes of managing and providing the services under these API Terms and the Agreement and agree that:
each party shall process all Personal Data transferred to it or collected or accessed by it for the purposes described in this Agreement in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law;
to the extent that either party processes Personal Data as a Controller in terms of Applicable Data Protection Law, for the purposes of this Agreement, that party is an independent Controller of such Personal Data;

Indeed Hiring Platform Terms
These Indeed Hiring Platform terms (“IHP Terms”) form part of, and are incorporated into the
Indeed Terms of Service
, and apply to any Employer or Job Seeker who accesses or uses the Indeed Hiring Platform or related services, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these IHP Terms. By accessing or using the Indeed Hiring Platform or related services or otherwise accepting these IHP Terms, you agree to these IHP Terms and to the
Indeed Terms of Service
(the “Agreement”), including the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using as part of the Indeed Hiring Platform.
Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IHP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
1. The Program
Indeed Hiring Platform is a platform designed to automate and streamline your hiring and employment decision-making processes by allowing users access to various products such as Indeed Interview or related services (the “Program”). You understand that use of the Program and related products is at your sole discretion and such tools are applied to your hiring process and job openings in the method and manner that you decide. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE LAW REGARDING YOUR EMPLOYMENT AND HIRING PRACTICES, INCLUDING TITLE VII, AND THAT YOU MUST INDEMNIFY INDEED AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF INDEED HIRING PLATFORM OR SIMILAR PRODUCTS. INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES COMPLIES WITH TITLE VII OR ANY SIMILAR LAW. Indeed makes no representation that Indeed or its affiliates are an employment agency by offering the Program and related tools. You understand that Indeed is not procuring employees for you or opportunities for Job Seekers.
By using the Program and accepting these IHP Terms you acknowledge and agree that you are asking Indeed to do the following: 1) post, on your behalf, Job Listings or Job Ads, as applicable, provided by you on the Site, and manage such ad campaign, using information such as the number of RSVPs or Started RSVPs, 2) include an RSVP function on the Site for a hiring event, interview session or interview post (“Event”) corresponding with each of your Job Ads or Listings, 3) receive from Job Seekers RSVPs to your Event(s), 4) add any screening tools you choose, including, but not limited to screening questions, evaluation methods, 5) send to you and/or other persons you identify information provided by a Job Seeker who RSVPs to your Event(s), and 6) communicate (via email or text message) information related to your Event(s) to Job Seekers who have RSVPed to your Event(s). If you request that Indeed send you and other persons you identify information provided by a Job Seeker who RSVPs to the Event(s), you certify and warrant that such person is part of your organization or is otherwise authorized to receive such information.
With regards to any Job Ad posted on the Site via the Program, including any Job Ad of your Event posted in Indeed’s discretion, you agree that such Job Ad shall be subject to the Indeed Ads Program terms, and the Indeed Ads Program terms are incorporated herein. Likewise, your use of any tools offered by Indeed is subject to the applicable Terms of Service. For example, using Resume Search or Smart Sourcing is subject to the Indeed Resume Search/Smart Sourcing Program Terms.
You further agree that you are solely responsible for everything regarding your Event(s), whether participating or hosting, including but not limited to, the content of the Job Listing or Job Ad, screening or screener questions, the handling and safeguarding of Job Seeker information provided to you and/or other persons you identify as authorized to receive information regarding an Event or a Job Seeker, the Event location, your attendees at the Event, or any literature, signage or other documentation at the event. You are responsible for accommodating Job Seeker requests or needs during the interview or application process during the Event. You represent and warrant that any data you collect from attendees and share with Indeed is collected in accordance with local privacy rules. Moreover, you grant to Indeed, its affiliates, and sublicensees the license to use your name, user name, and/or trademarks and logos in connection with any User Content or Indeed marketing materials, or actions by Indeed to promote or publicize such User Content (e.g. Job Listings) including the use of keywords in third-party internet search engine. You agree that Indeed may promote your Job Listing or Job Ad through any method in Indeed’s sole discretion, including but not limited to targeted advertising, on third party websites, including, but not limited to apps, or using keywords in third-party internet search engines. You further acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not responsible for reviewing qualifications, verifying identification, or otherwise screening Job Seekers during each Event and that you are solely responsible for so doing.
When Job Seekers apply or RSVP to your job listing, Indeed may give them the opportunity to provide certain demographic information, such as race and ethnicity, gender, age, LGBTQ+ community membership, and disability status as well as whether they have an arrest or conviction record (“demographic data”).  This Indeed demographic data survey is separate from any voluntary self-identification questions provided by Employers. By using the Program, you agree that Indeed may collect demographic data from Job Seekers applying to your job listing using Indeed’s demographic survey, and that Indeed may use the information from that survey to evaluate and improve our products. You further agree that you as an Employer have no ability, right, or entitlement to view or access demographic data collected via the Indeed demographic data survey pertaining to any Job Seeker or related to any employer by any means including civil discovery, subpoena, or any other legal process without their permission. You agree you are solely responsible for complying with applicable nondiscrimination laws. Indeed disclaims any warranty regarding the demographic composition of Job Seekers applying to any particular job.
Indeed may offer you the option to manage virtual and remote communications within Indeed products, including Indeed Interview, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”). Services may include giving you access to scheduling, video conferencing, web conferencing, meeting rooms, and other collaborative services offered by third-party telecommunications service providers. You understand and acknowledge that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider. Indeed disclaims all warranties regarding the transmission of Virtual Interviews including phone or video communications. Indeed does not guarantee (1) the availability of such services at the time you attempt to initiate them, (2) the quality of such services, or (3) the dates or times you’ve arranged for your Virtual Interview.
2. Cancellation
Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel any Job Listing or Job Ad (and corresponding Event) at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours). However, if you cancel an Event, Indeed will still bill you in accordance with any pricing listed in a separate agreement or otherwise agreed upon by you and Indeed, for RSVPs, clicks, applies or impressions accrued while the Job Ad for that Event was on the Site, and any platform fee, if applicable. Indeed may reach out to Job Seekers to communicate your Event cancellation. Indeed may immediately cancel the Program, any part thereof, or these IHP Terms at any time upon notice. Indeed may modify the Program or these IHP Terms at any time without liability, and your use of the Program after notice that these IHP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IHP Terms. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IHP Terms.
3. Prohibited Uses
You shall not, and shall not authorize or assist any party to, advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent activities or business practices in any state or country where your Job Listing or Job Ad is displayed. You represent and warrant that all your information and any and all information you provide to Indeed is correct and current; you hold and grant Indeed and partners all rights to copy, distribute, and display Job Listings or Job Ads (“Use”); and such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Listings or Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws. Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IHP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences. Indeed or partners may reject or remove any Job Listing, Job Ad, or content therein, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.
4. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON- INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, SERVICE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

5. Payment
You shall be charged in accordance with the pricing listed in a separate agreement or insertion order between you and Indeed, and based on clicks, RSVPs, applies or impressions (distributed within your budget in Indeed’s sole discretion) and platform fee, if applicable. Indeed may offer a subscription payment option wherein you will be charged as indicated in an insertion order. RSVPs are defined as a user completing the online RSVP form agreeing to attend your Event featured in any Job Ad. However, an RSVP does not guarantee that a Job Seeker will attend such Event. If your Indeed employer account has a credit card, bank account information, or other payment method on file for the Indeed Ads Program or any other Indeed service, we will charge that same payment method for your Indeed Hiring Platform RSVPs, if applicable.
If you are located in the United States, you shall pay all applicable charges in US dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais.

If your billing address is anywhere else, you may pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euros, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, Mexican Pesos, or Japanese Yen. Charges are exclusive of all taxes, including VAT. You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 120 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Indeed’s click, RSVP, apply, or impression measurements. Indeed’s determination of number of clicks, RSVPs, applies or impressions shall be binding.
You acknowledge and agree that any credit card, bank account, and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.
All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore. Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance.
6. Indemnification
You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, licensors, and partners from any third party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of your Program use, Job Listing, Job Ad, screening or screener questions, Event, Site or Your Services, or breach of these IHP Terms.

The Scope of Indeed’s Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers data that we collect through the Sites, directly from data subjects, or that we obtain from third parties. In cases where you follow a link to a third-party website, you are no longer covered by our Privacy Policy, and any data collection or processing activity that takes place on that website will be governed by that website’s own privacy policy. We only collect data on the Sites that display a direct link to this Privacy Policy.
In accordance with our Terms, the Site is generally only for use by people aged 16 or over. However, some jurisdictions have different age restrictions, as outlined below.
Japan:  For users in Japan, the Site is only for use by those who meet the permitted minimum age under Japanese law for Indeed to lawfully provide you with use of the Site.
EEA, Switzerland, UK, Turkey, and Ukraine:  As of 1 February 2024, access to the Site in the EEA, as well as Switzerland, UK, Turkey, and Ukraine, is restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older.
In all jurisdictions, if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use the Sites under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian, or responsible adult even if your age is above the Indeed permitted use age for that jurisdiction.
We adopt a range of measures to try to ensure that no information is knowingly solicited from individuals who do not meet the minimum age or any other applicable age requirements.
If we learn that an individual who does not meet the minimum age requirement has used the Site or provided personal information through the Site, we will restrict access to, or close their account, and remove that information from our systems.
Applicants to internal jobs at Indeed should reference the
Recruitment Privacy Policy
.
Current and former employees of Indeed should reach out to their Human Resources partner to reference the Global Employee Privacy Notice.
Data collection and use
Learn about the types of data Indeed uses to support the services we provide.
Indeed uses different types of information in order to provide our Sites’ services, products, and features to you.  The Personal Data we collect and process may vary, depending on how you use our Sites.
If Personal Data is required, to provide particular Indeed services or features to you, it will be indicated at the time of collection. If Personal Data is required and you choose not to provide it, then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.
Information that Indeed collects
In accordance with applicable data protection laws in the EEA, controllers must have a legal basis to process information. This means we rely on different legal bases to process your information, depending on the purpose of processing outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Full details of the types of personal data we collect from you, the purpose of processing it, our processing operations, and details of the legal bases we rely upon for GDPR are detailed below.
Retention of Your Information
Where Indeed acts as a controller of your Personal Data, we retain such data until it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose it is being used for, as required by applicable laws,  or until you ask us to delete it.
Information on how long we retain your information, for each purpose, is set out in the following section. In determining these appropriate retention periods, we consider the purposes for which we process Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We also consider the extent, nature, and sensitivity of Personal Data and our legal obligations with respect to data. Where possible and relying on our legitimate interest in improving our Sites, Indeed anonymizes or aggregates Personal Data, so that it can no longer be associated with or identify a user, in which case Indeed can further process the information. For example, we may use anonymized job seeker data, such as your profile data to test the accuracy of our products and services. Another way we may use anonymized data is to make sure our technology is helping all people get jobs in a way that is fair.
Where Indeed acts as Processor of your Personal Data, we store such data until instructed to delete it by the Controller.

Additional Purposes and Disclosures of Information
Profile data
By creating a searchable profile through the Site including when you upload a file resume on the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your profile data to third parties, in accordance with our
Indeed General Terms of Service
. When you create a profile on Indeed, it is set to searchable by default. This means that profile data (searchable) including your resume data, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers.
Please note Employers and Employer representatives who access your profile data while it is set to searchable visibility, or to whom you apply with your not searchable profile, may choose to share your profile with additional parties. Indeed is not responsible for such sharing. Similarly, when you share your searchable profile directly with a personalized link, we cannot control who sees your profile when you share that link.
You may change your profile privacy settings at any time. If you do not want Indeed to make your profile data (searchable) available to third parties without your direction or if you do not want Employers to contact you, you can set your profile to not searchable. If you would like to learn more about your profile, including the differences between searchable and not searchable private profile and how to change your profile privacy settings please see our
FAQ
.
Please note that as we continue to improve the Site, you may see phrases like ‘Employers can find you’ and ‘Employers can’t find you’. These phrases are to enhance user understanding and are synonymous with the terms ‘Searchable’ and ‘Not Searchable’ respectively.
Employer Accounts
We offer users the ability to link Employer accounts together. Linked users can be assigned specific roles, which provide varying levels of access to the candidate Personal Data contained in the parent account. If you are an Employer and you invite other Indeed users to link their accounts to yours, you agree that such linked users may have access to any and all information in your account. Types of candidate Personal Data include resume contacts, application materials and statuses, communications with applicants, any action taken by you or another user linked to the account, when you took that action, and billing information within the account. When an Employer account is delinked, either by your own action or an administrator’s action, you will lose access to all candidate Personal Data in the linked account.
Resume Review Services
In certain markets, we may also offer additional resume review services to help Job Seekers build and improve their resumes. For example, this can include helping you understand how your resume may be parsed by applicant tracking system software, feedback on ways to build a more effective resume, or a personalized resume review video. In providing these services, Indeed may give you feedback, including questions and comments on the contents of your resume, about Your Resume or other materials you submit through the services. We provide this feedback directly to you, and may give you the ability to access it within your account. It is not made available to Employers.
Automated Processing of Your Personal Data
We perform automated processing of Personal Data to evaluate specific aspects relating to a user and to analyze and predict a user’s preferences and interests. Where we perform this processing, we do so either on the basis of user consent or performance of a contract, whereby such processing is necessary for us to provide our services to Job Seekers and Employers. For example, such processing allows us to match Job Seekers with Employers effectively, to provide Job Seekers with Job Alerts, recommended jobs, and invitations to take action on jobs that the Job Seeker is likely to be more interested in, to send particular Job Seeker applications to an Employer, to display search results, to send application status notifications on behalf of Employers, or to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users. Such processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this Privacy Policy to protect the privacy of our users. You may contact privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces) to exercise your rights or contest any decision generated by said automated processing.
How we use Artificial Intelligence or “AI”
Indeed’s mission is to help people get jobs. To achieve this, job seekers and employers must be able to easily and quickly find one another and be equipped with information that may be helpful in understanding if a job seeker and employer are a good match. In support of these goals, we use personal data to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence (“
AI
”), to improve some of our products.
We use AI to provide candidate highlights which is a summary of your information, personalize outreach messages for employers, and offer job-based matched candidates. We use your personal data, including profile information and activity data to provide matched candidates, which is powered by Indeed. AI-generated outreach messages and candidate highlights leverage our partnership with vendors acting on our behalf. These AI features help job seekers and employers connect over potential employment opportunities.
Indeed may in some jurisdictions enable chatbots, which allow you to take certain actions on the Site, such as applying to a job, scheduling an interview, or otherwise interacting with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (“
Chatbot
”).

When a job seeker applies to job posts posted by job boards that have integrated Indeed Apply, if such job seeker agrees to the terms of service and the privacy policy of the job boards before submitting the application, the job seeker’s personal data may be transferred not just to employers but also to the job boards.
Transfers of Information to Job Seekers
Indeed sends certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers. This includes publishing Job Ads, Company Pages, and salary information on the Sites and publishing Job Listings on third-party websites. Indeed may also make available certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers, such as information about an Employer’s activity and responsiveness on the Sites. This can include the Employer representative’s name, the Employer’s city/state location, whether the Employer has taken or has chosen not to take an action with regard to the Job Seeker’s resume or application such as opening, viewing, responding to or making a decision in regard to it, whether the Employer has engaged with other Job Seekers or viewed other Job Seekers’ resumes, and whether the Employer has taken an action in regard to a Job Listing such as pausing or closing it. We do this in order to help Job Seekers evaluate employment opportunities. As an Employer, when you use the Sites (for example by posting a Job Listing or contacting a Job Seeker through the Indeed Resume Program) you agree that Indeed may provide this information to Job Seekers.
Transfers of Information to Service Providers and other third parties
We use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Sites and our services, products, and features, to protect our users and better understand their needs, and to optimize our services and our users’ experiences. By using our Sites, you acknowledge Indeed’s use of such third-parties, including, but not limited to, for the purpose of collecting, processing, analyzing, and recording your activity on, interaction with, and communications with, or through our Sites.

Indeed will not sell or rent data collected from the Indeed Interview Updates or Recruiter Invitations short code programs to third parties for marketing purposes.
Transfer of information to partners
In certain markets, Indeed works with partners who are involved in helping Job Seekers find opportunities. These partnerships introduce Job Seekers to Indeed and our services. These types of partnerships help Indeed understand the needs of Job Seekers in diverse audiences and how we can improve our services for diverse audiences. In some instances, Indeed shares limited information back to our partners about Job Seekers. For example,  confirmation that a Job Seeker has created an Indeed account or used one of our Sites successfully (for example, by applying to a certain number of jobs or utilizing our career guides). We strive to help all Job Seekers find jobs but we are primarily a website, so these partnerships help us reach audiences that may not come to Indeed through regular internet use. These partners may advertise their career services in partnership with Indeed. For the avoidance of doubt, where partners are co-branded on the site, each entity is a separate controller of your Personal Data.
Transfers of Publicly Available Information
When users post content on the Sites in a manner that is intended to make that content searchable by individuals, Indeed reserves the right to aggregate and share that information with third parties. For example, if an Employer posts a job on the Sites, Indeed may share that Job Listing or information contained within that Job Listing with third parties, at Indeed’s discretion and subject to agreement with such third parties. Indeed also reserves the right to share information aggregated from public sources in this capacity.
Transfers of information from service providers
Indeed may collect and use information about users obtained from third-party platforms such as social networking sites for the following purposes:
To classify and quantitatively understand the number of responses and spread of marketing campaign measures such as TV commercials;
To monitor the reputation of Indeed’s services to understand what is appreciated and what is not, and use this information in communication plans;
For early detection of improvements to the service, monitoring of user feedback, and planning of countermeasures;
To provide support for users who do not know how to use Indeed’s services;
To find product defects (e.g., “When I try to open the application, it displays a 501 error and I can’t use it” or “I can’t apply for a job”) and escalate the issue to the development team
Links to Third-Party Sites
The Sites may make available links to other third-party websites. When you click on such links, you may leave our Sites. Your web browser may also disclose to the third-party website the URL of the Sites page you clicked from, and this URL may include search terms and filters you used on the Sites. The Sites may also make available Company Pages, which may contain information provided by third-party Employers.
Indeed is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. Please consult their individual privacy policies to learn more.

Introduction: What is a cookie?
This Cookie Policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Sites. Cookies are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment. Cookies allow the Sites to remember important information that will make your use of the Sites more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Certain cookies will be used on the Sites regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not.
Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Sites. Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). We use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Sites. We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Sites to help customize your experience. We may associate Personal Data with a cookie file in those instances.
How We Use Cookies
We use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies, including from third-party partners such as Google and Facebook, for measurement services, better targeting advertisements, marketing purposes and to improve the performance of the Sites. This takes place from the Sites, when you download or install an Indeed App, and in some of our advertisements on third party websites. These cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies allow us to display our promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet and connect you with more Employers. We may also share information about your behavior on the Sites with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.
We also use these cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to facilitate the Indeed Targeted Ads Program and other advertisements to help us to determine which advertisements users have seen, how many times users have seen a particular advertisement, and on which sites a particular advertisement appeared. We may also allow Employers who participate in our Indeed Targeted Ads Program to place cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies in advertisements we serve on our Site and on third party websites to help these Employers understand how individuals interact with our advertisements about their Job Listings.
We may also use these cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies on the Sites to understand and inform an Employer about which users saw a particular Job Listing, Company Page, Hiring Event, or other advertisement in which the Employer is identified.

Product Analytics data.
Whereby logs activities by you and other users when the users interact with our websites or apps, when a page or a room is visited or where there is a conversation. We will never collect or record the content in conversations.
Please note that access to the conversation metadata, such as the participants’ ID (random alphanumeric number generated by the system), display names (optional), device information, duration of the call and any issues faced during the conversation, without being able to access the video or audio content of the conversation, may be accessible to our embedded customer’s support team or adiministrators via admin dashboard
Technical log data.

This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited within the Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.
Device information.
Whereby may collect and process information about devices used to access the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect and process some or all of this information depends on the type of device used and its settings.

If the processing requires your consent, cf. GDPR art 6 (1) item a, we will obtain it before we process your personal information.
Public professional information.
If you are on a plan for professional use, we may also collect public information about your company. This may include information you make available through a public LinkedIn profile. We use this information to assess if we should contact your company. If you are an appropriate point of contact for your company we may seek additional public contact information through LinkedIn and Zoominfo. Both Zoominfo and LinkedIn allows you to know what data they have collected about you; you can find it
here
for Zoominfo and
here
for LinkedIn. Similar information may also be used for learning more about our job applicants where this is necessary to make decisions about their candidacy.
The legal basis for processing professional information for the purposes of initiating, maintaining or building a a contractual relationship is our legitimate interest, cf. GDPR art.6 (1) item f.
Service and transactional notifications.
Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t opt out of this type of “service or transactional” emails (unless you delete your account) as they are necessary information for the Services.
The legal grounds for processing this information is that it is required for performing our commitment about communicating changes in plans and pricing to you in the contract we entered into with you, at your request (our Terms of Service) cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item b, and our legitimate interest of communicating important information about your account to you, cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item f.
Correspondence information.
We may process information that you choose to share with us if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Whereby.
The correspondence data may be processed for the purposes of communicating with you and record-keeping. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item f, namely the proper administration of our website and business and communications with users.
Integrations with external services
You as a participant in a meeting may choose to open one of the integrations we provide (Google Drive, YouTube, Trello and others) in rooms where these have been enabled. We may store data from use of integrations in a local browser storage, and process this to enrich the user experience. This data can be deleted with the delete option in the integration settings or by deleting it from the cache of your browser. When using an integration, metadata like title, thumbnail, dates and share permissions about content selected may be fetched and displayed in the web page. We may store non-personal/non-restricted information (eg. content id and access date) in a local browser storage to display lists of recently opened integrations. Restricted metadata is always stored by the services themselves and requires explicit consent given by the facing user to fetch it. The implementation is in compliance with the services privacy policies:
Google Privacy Policy
,
Trello Privacy Policy
and
Miro Privacy Policy
.
The information may be used for the purposes of operating our website and providing our services. This is required to deliver the Service to you as user, by taking steps, at your request, to enter into and to fulfilling such a contract (Terms of Service) cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item b.
Research information
We gather the data from and about the research subjects involved in the research we are conducting in relation to our product.
The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item f, namely the testing and improvement of our services.
Investor information
We may process the data about our investors and potential investors visiting our data rooms.
The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item f, namely the management of our company and its finances.
Please note that, for some of our customers, we are the processor of the following and other data categories: Display Name, Email address, Admin user (yes / no), Organization affiliation (for personal user accounts associated with a Business account), Video rooms created, Room name, Profile picture, Background picture.
How we process media (audio/video)
Participants exchange media such as audio, video and screen sharing within meetings. We only process media to enable participants to use our Service; we do not process media for our own purposes.
The legal ground for processing media is to fulfill the contract (Terms of Service) cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item b.
We will not store any meeting recordings or media sent between participants in a room, except on a strictly transient basis where this is a necessary part of the transmission. Customers who have access to the “Recording” feature will be able to record meetings, and they are then responsible for collecting consents from all participants in the meeting prior to starting the recording. They are also responsible for storing and processing the recording in compliance with regulations after downloading it from Whereby.
Security
Rooms will by default be set to Group call mode. Group call mode is delivered over a dedicated server infrastructure to allow many people in conversation while ensuring good stability. Your stream will be sent through video router servers which transmits it to the other participants in the call, and also transmits their streams to you. Streams will always be encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) in transit, but will be decrypted and re-encrypted when passing through the video routers. We operate an infrastructure of video routers distributed across the world, and you will be automatically routed to the closest one. The video router servers and all of our infrastructure adhere to strict security measures, preventing any eavesdropping or interruption of the video/audio streams.
Users can also choose to use “Small meeting” mode in Room Settings if they wish to prioritise having end-to-end encryption over quality and stability. In “Small meeting” mode, communication between participants is primarily sent through peer-to-peer connections, where audio and video streams are sent directly between participants and do not pass through any of our servers. Video and audio transmitted in the Service is then sent directly between the participants in a room and is encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) with client-generated encryption keys. In cases where a user is behind a strict firewall or NAT, video and audio need to be relayed via a TURN server, but end-to-end encryption is still maintained.
Providing your personal data to others
We may share information with third parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) with academic or non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5) to protect the vital interest of others, when we have reason to believe that doing so will prevent harm to someone or illegal activities.
Our categories of service providers and partners are:
Hosting/infrastructure/storage providers
Payment processors, including debt collectors
Analysis tools providers
Customer Support tools providers
Marketing and email providers
Co-marketing content providers
Recruiting tools providers
Internal communication tools providers
Law enforcement and judiciary based on a lawful order based on the jurisdiction we are subject to, or to combat unlawful use of our platform.
We only share data with co-marketing content partners when you, at your own initiative, fill a form to obtain the content. We will make sure it is clear to you that we have developed the content with our partner and that the partner will also obtain relevant information.
Business Transfers
We may disclose your personal data to any member of our group of companies (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and all its subsidiaries) insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes, and on the legal bases, set out in this policy.
In the case where we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we will notify you in advance and give you the option to delete your data before the transfer.
International transfers of your personal data
In some circumstances your personal data may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). You acknowledge that personal data that you submit for publication through our website or services may be available, via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such personal data by others. For information about what types of content you as a user are responsible, see this
Terms of Service

The hosting facilities for Account information stored by Whereby are situated in Ireland. The hosting facilities for Usage information are situated in Ireland and the United States. Transfers to the United States will be protected by appropriate safeguards, namely the use of
Standard Contractual Clause (SCC)
adopted or approved by the European Commission.
Please note that, for new data transfers, we will continue to rely on the old SCCs until September 27,2021. For existing transfer, we will continue to rely on SCCs until December 27, 2022, by which time all data transfers relying on the old SCCs will be moved over to the
new SCCs adopted and approved by the European Commission.
Retaining and deleting personal data
Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
We will retain your personal data as follows:
Transaction information will be retained for a minimum period of 5 years following date of the transaction, and for a maximum period of 10 years following the date of the transaction.
In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the following criteria:
Account information, Room information will be retained until you decide to delete your account or delete a room in Whereby.
Information about you used for Product & Marketing communication will be retained until you opt-out or withdraw your opt-in. You can change permissions through
Privacy Settings
.
The period of retention of usage information will be determined based on the need for historical data to determine statistical validity and relevance for product decisions and technical monitoring.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.

Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:

Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

Legal obligations sometimes require us to retain certain information for purposes like financial record-keeping, such as information about a payment you’ve made to Google for tax or accounting purposes.
Various laws and regulations require us to put in place measures to confirm that our users are old enough to use our services. To help determine your age, we process the date of birth you provide. We also process information about your activity in our services, both when you’re signed in to a Google Account or signed out, and use machine learning technology to determine if you are likely over 18. In certain cases, if we cannot confirm that you are old enough to use our services by other means, we can request other information to verify your age, like your government ID, credit card, a photo of you, or your phone number.
The information processed will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
Things you create or provide to us
:
Content you create, upload, or receive (like photos, videos, emails, docs and spreadsheets).
Google Dashboard
allows you to manage information associated with specific products.
Personal information that you provide us when you create a Google Account (like your
name
and password,
phone number
, date of birth, or
payment information
).
Information that we collect as you use our services
:
Information about your apps, browsers & devices
, such as
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using; and information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, (like IP address, crash reports, and system activity).
Information about your activity in our services
, such as your search terms, Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account, your views and interactions with content and ads, and your activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services. You can review and control activity data stored in your Google Account in
My Activity
.
Location information
, such as may be determined by GPS, IP address, and other data from sensors on or around your device, depending in part on your device and account settings.
Information from publicly accessible sources
, such as information that’s publicly available online (like if your name appears in a local newspaper article) or from other public sources.
Information from our trusted partners
, such as from directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, or security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.
The legal grounds for processing this information will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
When necessary for our
legitimate interests
and those of third parties, including to:
Enforce legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service.
For example, analyzing content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our services.
For example, collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public, including disclosing information to government authorities.
For example, responding to legal process or enforceable requests from governments and courts to disclose data, after carefully reviewing each request to make sure it satisfies applicable laws.
Perform research that improves our services for our users and benefits the public.
For example, processing information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
When necessary to protect the
vital interests
of you or another person. For example, processing data to detect and combat online child sexual abuse.
When we have a
legal obligation
to do so, such as retaining certain information for purposes like financial record-keeping, or processing and retaining information to help ensure that users are old enough to use our services.

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services

When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.

For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.

the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Controller to Processor Standard Contractual Clauses
SECTION I
Clause 1: Purpose and scope
The purpose of these standard contractual clauses is to ensure compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) for the transfer of personal data to a third country.
The Parties:
the natural or legal person(s), public authority/ies, agency/ies or other body/ies (hereinafter ‘entity/ies’) transferring the personal data, as listed in Annex I.A (hereinafter each ‘data exporter’), and
the entity/ies in a third country receiving the personal data from the data exporter, directly or indirectly via another entity also Party to these Clauses, as listed in Annex I.A (hereinafter each ‘data importer’)

These Clauses apply with respect to the transfer of personal data as specified in Annex I.B.
The Appendix to these Clauses containing the Annexes referred to therein forms an integral part of these Clauses.
Clause 2: Effect and invariability of the Clauses
These Clauses set out appropriate safeguards, including enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies, pursuant to Article 46(1) and Article 46(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, with respect to data transfers from controllers to processors and/or processors to processors, standard contractual clauses pursuant to Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided they are not modified, except to select the appropriate Module(s) or to add or update information in the Appendix. This does not prevent the Parties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.
These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data exporter is subject by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
Clause 3: Third-party beneficiaries
Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses, as third-party beneficiaries, against the data exporter and/or data importer, with the following exceptions:

The acceding entity shall have no rights or obligations arising under these Clauses from the period prior to becoming a Party.
SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
Clause 8: Data protection safeguards
The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.
8.1   Instructions
The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.
The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.
8.2   Purpose limitation
The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.
8.3   Transparency
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
8.4   Accuracy
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.
8.5   Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
8.6   Security of processing
The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.
8.7   Sensitive data
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.
8.8   Onward transfers
The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘
onward transfer
’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:
the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.
8.9   Documentation and compliance
The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.
The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.
The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.
The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
Clause 9: Use of sub-processors
GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION: The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 30 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.
Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.
The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.
The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.
The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.
Clause 10: Data subject rights
The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data exporter.
The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.
In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.
Clause 11: Redress
The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.
In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.
Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:
lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;
refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.
The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.
The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable laws.
Clause 12: Liability
Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of these Clauses.
The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.
The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from the data importer that part of the compensation corresponding to the data importer’s responsibility for the damage.
Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.
The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for the damage.
The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.
Clause 13: Supervision
The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.
The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.
SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
Clause 14: Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses
The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.
The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:
the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;
the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;
any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.
The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.
The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).
Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.
Clause 15: Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities
15.1   Notification
The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:
receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or
becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.
If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.
Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).
The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.
15.2   Review of legality and data minimisation
The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).
The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.
SECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS
Clause 16: Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination
The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.
In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:
the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;
the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.
In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.
Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
Clause 17: Governing law
These Clauses shall be governed by the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such law allows for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of Ireland.
Clause 18: Choice of forum and jurisdiction
Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.
The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of Ireland.
A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of the Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.
The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.

UK GDPR
As defined in section 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018.
This Addendum must always be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with UK Data Protection Laws and so that it fulfils the Parties’ obligation to provide the Appropriate Safeguards.
If the provisions included in the Addendum EU SCCs amend the Approved SCCs in any way which is not permitted under the Approved EU SCCs or the Approved Addendum, such amendment(s) will not be incorporated in this Addendum and the equivalent provision of the Approved EU SCCs will take their place.
If there is any inconsistency or conflict between UK Data Protection Laws and this Addendum, UK Data Protection Laws applies.
If the meaning of this Addendum is unclear or there is more than one meaning, the meaning which most closely aligns with UK Data Protection Laws applies.
Any references to legislation (or specific provisions of legislation) means that legislation (or specific provision) as it may change over time. This includes where that legislation (or specific provision) has been consolidated, re-enacted and/or replaced after this Addendum has been entered into.
Hierarchy
Although Clause 5 of the Approved EU SCCs sets out that the Approved EU SCCs prevail over all related agreements between the parties, the parties agree that, for Restricted Transfers, the hierarchy in Section ‎10 will prevail.
Where there is any inconsistency or conflict between the Approved Addendum and the Addendum EU SCCs (as applicable), the Approved Addendum overrides the Addendum EU SCCs, except where (and in so far as) the inconsistent or conflicting terms of the Addendum EU SCCs provides greater protection for data subjects, in which case those terms will override the Approved Addendum.
Where this Addendum incorporates Addendum EU SCCs which have been entered into to protect transfers subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 then the Parties acknowledge that nothing in this Addendum impacts those Addendum EU SCCs.
Incorporation of and changes to the EU SCCs
This Addendum incorporates the Addendum EU SCCs which are amended to the extent necessary so that:
together they operate for data transfers made by the data exporter to the data importer, to the extent that UK Data Protection Laws apply to the data exporter’s processing when making that data transfer, and they provide Appropriate Safeguards for those data transfers;
Sections ‎9 to ‎11 override Clause 5 (Hierarchy) of the Addendum EU SCCs; and
this Addendum (including the Addendum EU SCCs incorporated into it) is (1) governed by the laws of England and Wales and (2) any dispute arising from it is resolved by the courts of England and Wales, in each case unless the laws and/or courts of Scotland or Northern Ireland have been expressly selected by the Parties.

Amendments to this Addendum
The Parties may agree to change Clauses 17 and/or 18 of the Addendum EU SCCs to refer to the laws and/or courts of Scotland or Northern Ireland.
If the Parties wish to change the format of the information included in Part 1: Tables of the Approved Addendum, they may do so by agreeing to the change in writing, provided that the change does not reduce the Appropriate Safeguards.
From time to time, the ICO may issue a revised Approved Addendum which:
makes reasonable and proportionate changes to the Approved Addendum, including correcting errors in the Approved Addendum; and/or
reflects changes to UK Data Protection Laws;
The revised Approved Addendum will specify the start date from which the changes to the Approved Addendum are effective and whether the Parties need to review this Addendum including the Appendix Information. This Addendum is automatically amended as set out in the revised Approved Addendum from the start date specified.
If the ICO issues a revised Approved Addendum under Section ‎18, if any Party selected in Table 4 “Ending the Addendum when the Approved Addendum changes”, will as a direct result of the changes in the Approved Addendum have a substantial, disproportionate and demonstrable increase in:
its direct costs of performing its obligations under the Addendum; and/or
its risk under the Addendum,
and in either case it has first taken reasonable steps to reduce those costs or risks so that it is not substantial and disproportionate, then that Party may end this Addendum at the end of a reasonable notice period, by providing written notice for that period to the other Party before the start date of the revised Approved Addendum.
The Parties do not need the consent of any third party to make changes to this Addendum, but any changes must be made in accordance with its terms.
