Working together, we have the power to help fight fraud and scams
Phantom hacker scams
Some scammers now combine multiple scam types and take a phased approach to try to gain your trust and make scams more convincing.
How the scam works:
Phase I: Tech Support -
The impersonator claims to be from a legitimate tech support company and claims your computer has been hacked. They'll ask you to call a number and download software allowing them remote access to your computer to resolve the “issue”. Then they'll ask you to log into Online Banking and look for fraudulent charges.
Phase 2: Bank imposter -
Next, you'll receive a call from an imposter claiming to be from your bank, saying fraud is happening on your account. They'll tell you to electronically move money to a “safe” account, such as one with the Federal Reserve or another U.S. government agency.
Phase 3: Government imposter -
Then, you'll receive a third call from another imposter claiming to be a government official who is confirming the transaction. They may even send you an email or letter to make the scam look more legitimate.
How to protect yourself:
Don't click unsolicited pop-ups, links or attachments you receive by text or email. Don't call any phone numbers the imposter shares with you.
Be cautious if someone you don't know asks you to download software. Verify all requests before acting on them.
Don't grant remote access to your computer to anyone you don't know.
Be wary if someone tells you to click through bank warning messages. They're there for a reason.
Know that Bank of America may send you a text to validate unusual activity. However, we'll never ask you to send money to anyone, including yourself, or request that you share a code to resolve fraud.
Hang up if you receive a suspicious call from someone saying they're from the bank. Instead, call the number on your statement or back of your card.
Beware of a new way scammers are targeting you
Scammers are posing as your bank. They claim there is fraud on your account and try to convince you the only way to protect your money is for you to move it.
How it works:
Initial Contact
: Scammers reach out, pretending to be your bank, and inform you of fraudulent activity on your account. This contact may come from text or email, followed by a phone call from 'the fraud department.'
Deceptive Instructions
: Next, they instruct you to move your money. You may be asked to 'send money to yourself' using any payment application, including adding your money to your digital wallet. Once you add money to your digital wallet, the scammer will provide you a card number, attempting to convince you it is your 'new card'. From there, you're told to transfer your money to the 'new card'.
Money Sent to Scammer
: Once you transfer the funds, you realize you've sent money to the scammer, your money is gone and unlikely to be recovered.
Protect yourself & your money
Remember,
Bank of America will never ask you to pay anyone, including yourself.
Don't make a payment as a result of an unexpected text or call.
Never ignore scam warnings,
even if you are told to do so.

Additional Information
Third-Party Data Sharing
Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to share your data with them in order to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services. To do this, a third-party may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America user ID and password or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.
The third-party may access, on your behalf, information about you, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.
You should use caution and ensure that the third-party has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.
Use of your information by the third-party is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America. We recommend reviewing the third party's policies before sharing your personal information to understand how they will use and store your account information. For example, look for whether they sell any of your personal information, and if your information will be transferred, processed, or stored outside of the United States.
We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site user ID and password.
If you share your Bank of America user ID, password or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.
If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a third-party, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America password to ensure that the third-party cannot continue to access your account.
You may revoke your consent for certain third parties through the Security Center within
Bank of America Online Banking
.
Social Media
Bank of America engages with customers on social media platforms such as Facebook®, X®, YouTube® and LinkedIn®.
Any content you post on official Bank of America managed social media pages, such as pictures, information, opinions or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of those respective platforms.
When interacting with official Bank of America social media pages, Bank of America's privacy notices,

covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the “CCPA”). This “Notice” constitutes our notice at collection and our privacy policy pursuant to the CCPA.
Introduction
Under the CCPA, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly with a particular California resident and includes certain categories of Personal Information discussed below that constitute “Sensitive Personal Information.” The CCPA, however, does not apply to certain information, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”).
The specific Personal Information that we collect, use, and disclose relating to a California resident covered by the CCPA will vary based on our relationship or interaction with that individual. For example, this Notice does not apply with respect to information that we collect about California residents who apply for or obtain our financial products and services for personal, family, or household purposes. For more information about how we collect, disclose, and secure information relating to these customers, please refer to our
U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice
.
Keeping Personal Information secure is one of our most important priorities. Consistent with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations, we maintain physical, technical, electronic, procedural and organizational safeguards and security measures that are designed to protect personal data against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or access, whether it is processed by us or by others on our behalf.

To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's log-in information to a data security company that it has hired to investigate and remediate a data breach that involved that individual's account.
To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may use information about a California resident's ethnicity and/or the contents of email and text messages to investigate claims of racial discrimination or hate speech.
To ensure the physical safety of natural persons, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's geolocation information to law enforcement to investigate an alleged kidnapping.
For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a California resident's current interaction with us.
To perform services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying a California resident's information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage.
To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.
Rights under the CCPA
If you are a California resident covered by the CCPA, you have the right to:
(1) Receive this Notice at or before the point of collection of your Personal Information.
(2) Request we disclose to you free of charge the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:
a. the categories of Personal Information about you that we collected;
b. the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;
c. the purpose for collecting Personal Information about you;

(3) Request we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.
(4) Request we delete Personal Information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception.
(5) Be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
Please see the section below entitled, “How to Exercise Your Rights,” for instructions explaining how you can exercise these rights described above.
Requests for specific pieces of Personal Information will require additional information to verify your identity.
For individuals submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.
For a company or organization submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization from the individual such as a Power of Attorney and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.
In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual. Additionally, we will not honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California resident or where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA's access or deletion rights.
We will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request. We will not provide Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, unique biometric data, health care or medical identification numbers, account passwords or security questions and answers, or any specific pieces of information if the disclosure presents the possibility of unauthorized access that could result in identity theft or fraud or unreasonable risk to data or systems and network security.
We will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA. If we need an extension for up to an additional 45 days in order to process your request, we will provide you with an explanation for the delay.
How We Process Opt-Out Preferences
Bank of America permits California residents to automatically exercise their right to opt out of sale/sharing through opt-out preference signals without having to make individualized opt out requests. Bank of America treats opt-out preference signals as valid requests to opt out of sale/sharing for the browser.

Additional Information
Third-Party Data Sharing
Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to share your data with them in order to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services. To do this, a third-party may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America user ID and password or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.
The third-party may access, on your behalf, information about you, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.
You should use caution and ensure that the third-party has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.
Use of your information by the third-party is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America. We recommend reviewing the third party's policies before sharing your personal information to understand how they will use and store your account information. For example, look for whether they sell any of your personal information, and if your information will be transferred, processed, or stored outside of the United States.
We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site user ID and password.
If you share your Bank of America user ID, password or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.
If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a third-party, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America password to ensure that the third-party cannot continue to access your account.
You may revoke your consent for certain third parties through the Security Center within
Bank of America Online Banking
.

WHAT DOES BANK OF AMERICA DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Introduction
Under the CCPA, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly with a particular California resident and includes certain categories of Personal Information discussed below that constitute “Sensitive Personal Information.” The CCPA, however, does not apply to certain information, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”).

For example, this Notice does not apply with respect to information that we collect about California residents who apply for or obtain our financial products and services for personal, family, or household purposes. For more information about how we collect, disclose, and secure information relating to these customers, please refer to our
U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice

For example, a California resident's precise geolocation may be used by a mobile application that is providing them with directions on how to get to a specific location.
To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's log-in information to a data security company that it has hired to investigate and remediate a data breach that involved that individual's account.
To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may use information about a California resident's ethnicity and/or the contents of email and text messages to investigate claims of racial discrimination or hate speech.
To ensure the physical safety of natural persons, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's geolocation information to law enforcement to investigate an alleged kidnapping.
For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a California resident's current interaction with us.
To perform services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying a California resident's information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage.
To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.
Rights under the CCPA
If you are a California resident covered by the CCPA, you have the right to:
(1) Receive this Notice at or before the point of collection of your Personal Information.
(2) Request we disclose to you free of charge the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:
a. the categories of Personal Information about you that we collected;
b. the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;
c. the purpose for collecting Personal Information about you;
d. the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Information about you and the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed (if applicable) and the purpose for disclosing the Personal Information about you; and
e. the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;
(3) Request we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.
(4) Request we delete Personal Information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception.
(5) Be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
Please see the section below entitled, “How to Exercise Your Rights,” for instructions explaining how you can exercise these rights described above.
Requests for specific pieces of Personal Information will require additional information to verify your identity.
For individuals submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.
For a company or organization submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization from the individual such as a Power of Attorney and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.
In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual. Additionally, we will not honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California resident or where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA's access or deletion rights.
We will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request. We will not provide Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, unique biometric data, health care or medical identification numbers, account passwords or security questions and answers, or any specific pieces of information if the disclosure presents the possibility of unauthorized access that could result in identity theft or fraud or unreasonable risk to data or systems and network security.
We will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA. If we need an extension for up to an additional 45 days in order to process your request, we will provide you with an explanation for the delay.
How We Process Opt-Out Preferences
Bank of America permits California residents to automatically exercise their right to opt out of sale/sharing through opt-out preference signals without having to make individualized opt out requests. Bank of America treats opt-out preference signals as valid requests to opt out of sale/sharing for the browser. Please note, however, we do not “sell” or “share” personal information with any third parties, as such terms are defined by the CCPA.

Working together, we have the power to help fight fraud and scams
Phantom hacker scams
Some scammers now combine multiple scam types and take a phased approach to try to gain your trust and make scams more convincing.
How the scam works:
Phase I: Tech Support -
The impersonator claims to be from a legitimate tech support company and claims your computer has been hacked. They'll ask you to call a number and download software allowing them remote access to your computer to resolve the “issue”. Then they'll ask you to log into Online Banking and look for fraudulent charges.
Phase 2: Bank imposter -
Next, you'll receive a call from an imposter claiming to be from your bank, saying fraud is happening on your account. They'll tell you to electronically move money to a “safe” account, such as one with the Federal Reserve or another U.S. government agency.
Phase 3: Government imposter -
Then, you'll receive a third call from another imposter claiming to be a government official who is confirming the transaction. They may even send you an email or letter to make the scam look more legitimate.
How to protect yourself:
Don't click unsolicited pop-ups, links or attachments you receive by text or email. Don't call any phone numbers the imposter shares with you.
Be cautious if someone you don't know asks you to download software. Verify all requests before acting on them.
Don't grant remote access to your computer to anyone you don't know.
Be wary if someone tells you to click through bank warning messages. They're there for a reason.
Know that Bank of America may send you a text to validate unusual activity. However, we'll never ask you to send money to anyone, including yourself, or request that you share a code to resolve fraud.
Hang up if you receive a suspicious call from someone saying they're from the bank. Instead, call the number on your statement or back of your card.
Beware of a new way scammers are targeting you
Scammers are posing as your bank. They claim there is fraud on your account and try to convince you the only way to protect your money is for you to move it.
How it works:
Initial Contact
: Scammers reach out, pretending to be your bank, and inform you of fraudulent activity on your account. This contact may come from text or email, followed by a phone call from 'the fraud department.'
Deceptive Instructions
: Next, they instruct you to move your money. You may be asked to 'send money to yourself' using any payment application, including adding your money to your digital wallet. Once you add money to your digital wallet, the scammer will provide you a card number, attempting to convince you it is your 'new card'. From there, you're told to transfer your money to the 'new card'.
Money Sent to Scammer
: Once you transfer the funds, you realize you've sent money to the scammer, your money is gone and unlikely to be recovered.
Protect yourself & your money
Remember,
Bank of America will never ask you to pay anyone, including yourself.
Don't make a payment as a result of an unexpected text or call.
Never ignore scam warnings,
even if you are told to do so.

Additional Information
Third-Party Data Sharing
Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to share your data with them in order to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services. To do this, a third-party may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America user ID and password or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.
The third-party may access, on your behalf, information about you, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.
You should use caution and ensure that the third-party has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.
Use of your information by the third-party is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America. We recommend reviewing the third party's policies before sharing your personal information to understand how they will use and store your account information. For example, look for whether they sell any of your personal information, and if your information will be transferred, processed, or stored outside of the United States.
We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site user ID and password.
If you share your Bank of America user ID, password or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.
If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a third-party, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America password to ensure that the third-party cannot continue to access your account.
You may revoke your consent for certain third parties through the Security Center within
Bank of America Online Banking
.

In the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice, we have not “sold” or “shared” Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information subject to the CCPA nor have we “sold” or “shared” Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information of minors under the age of 16.

How We Use Sensitive Personal Information
We only use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for the following purposes consistent with CCPA Regulations:
To perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average California resident who requests those goods or services. For example, a California resident's precise geolocation may be used by a mobile application that is providing them with directions on how to get to a specific location.
To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's log-in information to a data security company that it has hired to investigate and remediate a data breach that involved that individual's account.
To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may use information about a California resident's ethnicity and/or the contents of email and text messages to investigate claims of racial discrimination or hate speech.
To ensure the physical safety of natural persons, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's geolocation information to law enforcement to investigate an alleged kidnapping.
For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a California resident's current interaction with us.
To perform services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying a California resident's information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage.
To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.

For a company or organization submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization from the individual such as a Power of Attorney and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.
In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual. Additionally, we will not honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California resident or where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA's access or deletion rights.
We will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request. We will not provide Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, unique biometric data, health care or medical identification numbers, account passwords or security questions and answers, or any specific pieces of information if the disclosure presents the possibility of unauthorized access that could result in identity theft or fraud or unreasonable risk to data or systems and network security.
We will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA. If we need an extension for up to an additional 45 days in order to process your request, we will provide you with an explanation for the delay.

Bank of America permits California residents to automatically exercise their right to opt out of sale/sharing through opt-out preference signals without having to make individualized opt out requests.

Additional Information
Third-Party Data Sharing
Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to share your data with them in order to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services. To do this, a third-party may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America user ID and password or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.
The third-party may access, on your behalf, information about you, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.
You should use caution and ensure that the third-party has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.
Use of your information by the third-party is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America. We recommend reviewing the third party's policies before sharing your personal information to understand how they will use and store your account information. For example, look for whether they sell any of your personal information, and if your information will be transferred, processed, or stored outside of the United States.
We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site user ID and password.
If you share your Bank of America user ID, password or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.
If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a third-party, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America password to ensure that the third-party cannot continue to access your account.
You may revoke your consent for certain third parties through the Security Center within
Bank of America Online Banking
.

Any content you post on official Bank of America managed social media pages, such as pictures, information, opinions or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of those respective platforms.

) explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information relating to
California residents
covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the “CCPA”). This “Notice” constitutes our notice at collection and our privacy policy pursuant to the CCPA.
Introduction
Under the CCPA, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly with a particular California resident and includes certain categories of Personal Information discussed below that constitute “Sensitive Personal Information.” The CCPA, however, does not apply to certain information, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”).
The specific Personal Information that we collect, use, and disclose relating to a California resident covered by the CCPA will vary based on our relationship or interaction with that individual. For example, this Notice does not apply with respect to information that we collect about California residents who apply for or obtain our financial products and services for personal, family, or household purposes. For more information about how we collect, disclose, and secure information relating to these customers, please refer to our
U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice
.
Keeping Personal Information secure is one of our most important priorities. Consistent with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations, we maintain physical, technical, electronic, procedural and organizational safeguards and security measures that are designed to protect personal data against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or access, whether it is processed by us or by others on our behalf.
Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

Government Agencies as required by laws and regulations; and
Other persons or entities with which you may use or direct us to intentionally interact or to which you may use or direct us to intentionally disclose your Personal Information.
We do not disclose Personal Information to any other categories of third parties.
We collect, use and disclose for our business purposes Personal Information, including Sensitive Personal Information, relating to California residents to operate, manage, and maintain our business, to provide our products and services, and to accomplish our business or commercial purposes, including the following:
Performing services, including maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, processing payments, providing financing, providing advertising or marketing services (except for cross-context behavioral advertising, a type of targeted advertising), providing analytic services, providing research services, facilitating event management and execution, managing our real estate portfolio, or providing similar services;
Helping to ensure security and integrity to the extent the use of Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for these purposes;
Short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a current interaction with us, where the information is not disclosed to a third party and is not used to build a profile or otherwise alter the California resident's experience outside the current interaction with us;

Sale or Sharing of Personal Information
In the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice, we have not “sold” or “shared” Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information subject to the CCPA nor have we “sold” or “shared” Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information of minors under the age of 16.
For purposes of this Notice:
“sold” means the disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration; and
“shared” means the disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising.
How We Use Sensitive Personal Information
We only use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for the following purposes consistent with CCPA Regulations:
To perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average California resident who requests those goods or services. For example, a California resident's precise geolocation may be used by a mobile application that is providing them with directions on how to get to a specific location.
To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's log-in information to a data security company that it has hired to investigate and remediate a data breach that involved that individual's account.
To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may use information about a California resident's ethnicity and/or the contents of email and text messages to investigate claims of racial discrimination or hate speech.
To ensure the physical safety of natural persons, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's geolocation information to law enforcement to investigate an alleged kidnapping.
For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a California resident's current interaction with us.
To perform services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying a California resident's information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage.
To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.
Rights under the CCPA
If you are a California resident covered by the CCPA, you have the right to:
(1) Receive this Notice at or before the point of collection of your Personal Information.
(2) Request we disclose to you free of charge the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:
a. the categories of Personal Information about you that we collected;
b. the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;
c. the purpose for collecting Personal Information about you;
d. the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Information about you and the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed (if applicable) and the purpose for disclosing the Personal Information about you; and
e. the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;
(3) Request we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.
(4) Request we delete Personal Information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception.
(5) Be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
Please see the section below entitled, “How to Exercise Your Rights,” for instructions explaining how you can exercise these rights described above.
Requests for specific pieces of Personal Information will require additional information to verify your identity.
For individuals submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.
For a company or organization submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization from the individual such as a Power of Attorney and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.
In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual. Additionally, we will not honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California resident or where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA's access or deletion rights.
We will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request. We will not provide Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, unique biometric data, health care or medical identification numbers, account passwords or security questions and answers, or any specific pieces of information if the disclosure presents the possibility of unauthorized access that could result in identity theft or fraud or unreasonable risk to data or systems and network security.
We will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA. If we need an extension for up to an additional 45 days in order to process your request, we will provide you with an explanation for the delay.
How We Process Opt-Out Preferences
Bank of America permits California residents to automatically exercise their right to opt out of sale/sharing through opt-out preference signals without having to make individualized opt out requests. Bank of America treats opt-out preference signals as valid requests to opt out of sale/sharing for the browser. Please note, however, we do not “sell” or “share” personal information with any third parties, as such terms are defined by the CCPA.
