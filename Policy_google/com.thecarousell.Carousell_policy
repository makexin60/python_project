" of prospective users through the Facebook or Google advertising platforms and/or similar service providers.

policy
is to irreversibly hash (encrypt) such lists locally and prior to uploading. Facebook will then match the hashed data against their own user and generate a lookalike audience. The uploaded list will then be deleted and will not be used for any other purposes. Carousell will not have access to the identity of any user in the lookalike audience unless such individual chooses to click on the advertisements we deliver.  If you wish to opt out of "similar audiences" in Google, you can do so through your

Sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) are encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
It is important that you protect against unauthorised access to your Account and information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your password and Account secure (e.g. by signing out after using our Services).

You may access and update your information within our Services through the “Settings” page of your Account.

In certain circumstances, you may need to provide us with personal information about someone other than yourself.

9. Tracking technologies
We use tracking technologies in our Services. These enable us to understand how you use our Services which, in turn, helps us to provide and improve our Services. However, the tracking technologies do not access, receive or collect information that can be used to identify you. We have listed below some examples of the tracking technologies used in our Services:
Cookies. A cookie is a small data file sent from a website to your browser that is stored on your device. Cookies are used for several purposes, including to display the most appropriate content based on your interests and activity on our Services, estimate and report our Service's total audience size and traffic, and conduct research to improve our Services.
We may also partner with selected third-party vendors such as Google Analytics to allow tracking technologies and remarketing services on our Platforms through the use of first-party cookies and third-party cookies for such purposes.
You can configure your device's settings to reflect your preference to accept or reject cookies. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to take full advantage of our Services.
For more information on cookies control, please see Section 10 “Carousell Opt-Out” below.
Pixels. We may from time to time use certain
Facebook Business Tools
such as the
Facebook Pixel
. This tool allows Carousell to keep track of what users do after they see or click on a Facebook advertisement and enables us to monitor the effectiveness of Facebook ads for purposes of statistics and market research. Carousell will be able to better understand and deliver ads and make them more relevant to you. The collected data remains anonymous and Carousell cannot see the personal data of any individual user.
However, the collected data is saved and processed by Facebook. Facebook may be able to connect the data with your Facebook account and use the data for their own advertising purposes and in accordance with Facebook’s
Data Use Policy

Clear gifs. We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons or web bugs) to help us better manage content on our Services by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Data collected in this way is anonymous to us, which means we cannot see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is saved and processed by Facebook. Facebook can connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes, per Facebook’s Data Policy which can be found at
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/
. You can allow Facebook and its partners to place ads on and outside of Facebook. A cookie can also be saved on your device for these purposes.

https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_=_
Flash cookies. We use Flash cookies (a.k.a local shared objects or LSOs) to store some of your viewing preferences on our Services. These are used to collect and store information but differ from browser cookies in the amount, type and manner in which data is stored.

You may still be served advertisements for other reasons, such as:
General advertisements served to all users of our Platforms.
Personalised and/or targeted advertisements from other third parties and not delivered by Carousell through your mobile and/or web activities.
Please also note that even though Carousell does not share your personal data (other than hashed or device identifiers, to the extent they are personal data in some countries) with any advertising networks and exchanges without your consent or unless as specified in this Privacy Policy, when you view or interact with an advertisement via any of your devices, an advertiser or advertising network or exchanges can infer that you are within their target audience; or when you click on an advertisement, the publisher and/or advertiser will know you visited the page that you clicked on and may still be able to associate personal data collected by such third parties directly from you through their cookies and similar tracking technologies.
