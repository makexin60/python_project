Country code, Language code, Time zone, Platform version, OS version, Firebase Android App ID, Device ID, Ad ID, Package name of the app, Firebase installation ID (FID).

This data is sent and stored on the Google Firebase servers and is used to enhance the app’s functionality and overall user experience. This data is anonymous and does not include your personal information (it does not uniquely identify a user).
