Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;
0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;
0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;

You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.
Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:

0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same.

0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.
If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.
Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.
To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email:

Online Privacy Policy Generator for Website, Blog, eCommerce or App
Do you have a website, blog, or app on the internet? If yes, then you absolutely need to have a
Privacy Policy
for it.
Today, online privacy is more important than ever. Everyone should care about privacy and
comply with the privacy laws
of the respective jurisdiction.
Many countries have enacted information privacy laws that you are required to follow if you collect information about your users. Likely, your website or mobile app collects, at the very least, the
names and email addresses of your users
.
Often online services ask for more information such as
phone number, residential address, location
, financial details, etc.
You might be asking, what is a privacy policy?
Privacy Policy definition:
Privacy Policy is the document that outlines which information about the users you collect, where this information is stored, and how it will be treated.
Chances are when operating your website or a mobile app, you will need to
collect, process, and store private user information
. When doing it, you will have to comply with the privacy laws of the country where you operate or the country where your users come from.
The first step in making your service compliant  –  is
creating and publishing the privacy policy
for your website or application.
PolicyMaker will help you to create a standard Privacy Policy
for your website or mobile app that should be sufficient for most services.
Data Privacy and Information Privacy Laws
Data privacy, which is also known as
data protection or information privacy
is a very prominent topic in today’s world.
According to Wikipedia
:
Data Privacy is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, legal and political issues surrounding them.
In simple terms, Data Privacy governs how user data is
collected, shared, and used
.
There are many laws in various countries around the world that govern the complex issues of data privacy. Some of the well-known regulations are the
GDPR in European Union
,
CCPA in the California United States
, and
China Internet Security Law
.
We encourage you to make yourself familiar with the
privacy laws
of the countries where you run your business and make sure to follow them.
Why Do I Need a Privacy Policy Statement?
First of all, you need a Privacy Policy statement for your website or app to make a written
commitment to guarding the privacy of your users
. When collecting private information, you become responsible for this data.
Depending on the countries where you are incorporated or operate in, you might be
subject to the privacy laws
, that in most cases, would require you to have a written and published Privacy Policy.
If you decide to publish your app in the app stores, start accepting the payments or monetize your website using ads, you will also likely need to
provide the link to the privacy policy
of your service.
When operating a website or mobile app, you should be ready to answer questions that your users, business partners, or authorities might have about the privacy policy of your service. If you work with other businesses, you will likely need to share with them your privacy policy and
make sure you abide by it
.
Privacy Policy Template
Big companies usually hire
experienced lawyers
to create a privacy policy for their websites and apps. Hiring a professional law firm to create a privacy policy will likely cost a sizable amount of money and could take a lot of time.
The good news is that the majority of privacy policies on the internet today are made from templates that have universal wording. You might be thinking about looking for those templates on the internet and going through them yourself, but please
do not waste your time
!
Our team at PolicyMaker has already done it for you! We
constantly check for the updates on the privacy policy laws
worldwide and update the PolicyMaker with the latest developments.
We create a
VERY simple and universal privacy policy generator
that will save you the time and stress of trying to write the privacy policy yourself by using the templates!
GDPR Compliant Privacy Policy Made For Your Business
General Data Protection Regulation or as many people call it
GDPR
– is the c
ornerstone of the Privacy Protection laws in the European Union
. It was implemented in 2018 and is made to let people control their personal data.
If you have visitors or users that reside in
European countries, you have to comply with GDPR
regulations. We have made it easy for you!
Our team included the clauses that will cover all the necessary GDPR requirements in your Privacy Policy. All you need to do to get a
GDPR compliant Privacy Policy
is to generate it using PolicyMaker and paste the ready-made policy text on your website!
Privacy Policy That Includes Latest 2020 CalOPPA Requirements
CalOPPA is a vital regulation that you need to follow when servicing users that reside in
California, USA
.
The
California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003
is the regulation that requires websites to have clear privacy notice available to users. The privacy policy should satisfy several
CalOPPA requirements
and have appropriate wording.
PolicyMaker offers you a CalOPPA privacy policy generator that follows all the
latest requirements of this legislation
.
Make Your CCPA Privacy Policy Fully Compliant With California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations of 2020
The
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)
went into effect on the 1st of January 2020. It is a relatively new legislation that was only created in 2018.
CCPA was made to further safeguard consumers and their privacy rights
.
CCPA applies to all businesses that serve customers in California
, USA, and satisfy the list of specific criteria.
Some of the abovementioned criteria are:
The business has annual gross revenues of over
25 million USD
The business has personal information of over
50,000 consumers
While this regulation at the moment applies mostly to medium or large businesses, it is easy to imagine how even a small online business can accumulate the
data of over 50,000 consumers
.
That is why your Privacy Policy made by PolicyMaker will, by default, include clauses that will make your business
compliant with CCPA law
.

Make Ideal Privacy Policy for Blog
Are you just starting a blog or already having one and looking to make a
comprehensive privacy policy
? If so, then you are in the right place.
Privacy Policy is a significant page for every website and blog in particular. If you have a blog today, you might collect some personal information about your readers. For example, you could invite people to subscribe to your newsletter and receive the
latest updates from your blog
.
All the data you collect about your users, including but not limited to their name, email address, the pages they visited, information about their browsing behavior on your website, etc. can be considered
private information
.
Today, many countries around the world have strict regulations that you need to follow if you collect any information about your users, or even run a blog! Complying with
privacy policy regulations
will prevent you from violating the laws and will shield you from potential
legal troubles
.
Many countries today have
privacy laws
. But the most talked-about and
strictly enforced regulations
are made by the members of the European Union and the USA.
You might be wondering if you still
need to follow those strict rules
even if your blog is mainly serving people from the outside of the
EU
or
USA
. The answer is yes. Unless you completely prohibit visitors from the EU or USA from entering your blog, you still
need to follow the privacy rules
imposed by those states.
The first and probably most crucial step in making your blog compliant with
international privacy laws
is to create and publish your blog Privacy Policy page. You will see how to make one using PolicyMaker in a moment!
Generate Your Blog Privacy Policy With The Best Templates Offered by PolicyMaker
As you might know, most legal documents are created using the best practices or, in other words –
legal templates
. A template is the standard document that you can modify and fill in with your data to customize the
legal text
for your business.
When creating the privacy policy for your blog, you can take several routes. The most expensive one – is to hire a fancy law firm to generate a privacy policy for your blog. Most likely, the company that you will employ
will use their template
and will slightly tweak it depending on your requirements.
This
option is expensive
, but you might have assurances that the created document will do its intended purpose.
Another route is to browse through countless websites on the internet, search for privacy policy templates for a blog, and compile the privacy policy yourself. It will likely be cheaper than hiring a law firm, but it will
take a lot of your time
, and the final result might not be perfect. Unless, of course, you are a lawyer yourself!
The third option that combines the best of two worlds and is very likely the
best choice – is to use PolicyMaker!
Next, we’ll explain why.
