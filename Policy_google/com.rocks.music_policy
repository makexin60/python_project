Collection and Use of User’s Personal Information
ASD Dev Video Player for All Format
does not collect, store, or share
any personal information. The app requires certain permissions to function properly, but these permissions are strictly used to provide the service and are not used for any other purpose.
The different types of permissions we ask from users to offer the best of our products and services are-
1. All File Access-
We need this permission to provide our users with a comprehensive and seamless experience. This permission enables us to provide advanced features, making it simple for you to organize and enjoy your media effortlessly.
With
ALL FILES ACCESS
permission, the app can perform all functions of file management (e.g., deleting, renaming, moving media files), browse, read, manage, download, and display any format of video files, audio files, images, or any media files on the device without limiting the user to specific app folders. This permission lets the app gather all media files on your device and display them in one place.
Users can open and play any video or audio file stored on their device without needing to manually move the file to a specific folder or provide additional access permissions. Users get multiple options to manage files within the app, such as:
Deleting unwanted media files.
Renaming files.
Moving or copying files between directories.
ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION OF FILES
Encryption:
The app allows users to encrypt their media files for added security. For example, if a user wants to secure sensitive video files, the app can encrypt these files with an algorithm (e.g., AES-256 encryption). The ALL FILES ACCESS permission is necessary to locate the files, read their contents, and apply encryption.
Decryption:
When users want to access encrypted media, the app uses the ALL FILES ACCESS permission to locate the encrypted files, read their content, and decrypt them for playback within the app.
All encryption and decryption processes are done locally on the device,
ensuring that no personal data is transmitted to external servers or third parties.
2. Network-
This permission is required when you need to
download any social media videos (using our Video Downloader feature), Network streaming, or watch online trending videos when your device is connected to WLAN or Mobile Data.
We do not collect or store any information through this but only perform the functions mentioned before.
3. Usage and Tracking Data-
This Usage Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data. It may also include information such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, unique device identifiers, usage patterns, and other diagnostic data. We collect non-personal tracking information to help us improve the App and provide better services.
4. Microphone-
Microphone access is necessary for using the audio recording feature effectively. This permission is dedicated to recording audio only. Should you delete the audio files from your local storage, Rareprob will not and does not store any of that audio material.
5. Consumer Support and Follow-up Services-
When users send their feedback or error reports via email, we obtain your username, email address, and email content. This helps in communicating with you about any problems you face while using our product or service.
6. API-
The YouTube API has been incorporated into our software to provide you with smooth access to the platform's services. It's important to mention that if you use any of our services, a third party may be notified about which parts of our Platform you have operated. Under GDPR legislation, the use of these services is a legitimate interest as defined by Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO. For more, check-

6. Sensitive Personal Data-

These platforms allow us to share updates, features, and promotional content, and interact with users who follow our accounts. Please note that while we use these platforms to advertise and promote our apps, we do not share your personal information with these social networks unless you specifically opt-in or interact with our content directly on their platforms.

Payments
We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).
We will not store or collect your payment card details.
That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.
The payment processors we work with are:
Apple Store In-App Payments

Links to other sites
Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
Children’s Privacy
At ASD Dev, our products and services are designed for users who are 13 years of age or older (or the age specified by law in your country/region). If you are a guardian of a child under the age of 13 (or the legal age in your country/region), we encourage you to actively guide and supervise the child during their use of our products, ensuring the safety of their personal information.
We advise child users under 13 (or the prescribed age in your country/region) to carefully read this policy with the assistance of a parent or guardian before using our services. All services or the provision of information should only be done with parental or guardian consent. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child, we will take swift action to delete the data.
Changes to this privacy policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the “effective date” at the top of this Privacy Policy.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
