Lawful basis for processing

Providing you app services.
We process data related to your pregnancy to provide you services in the app based on the app terms and relying on performance of contract. However, due to the very nature of the app, we need to process data about your pregnancy status (due date, week of pregnancy, etc.), which amounts to special category of data, in order to provide the core functionalities of the app itself, which includes enabling you to follow your or the mother’s pregnancy journey, keep track of your or the mother’s well-being and the baby’s development.
Please note that we cannot provide the services without processing data related to your pregnancy.
We rely on your explicit consent to process this data. However, you will be unable to use the app without providing us with this consent. You can choose to delete your account and all data associated therewith at any time if you do not want us to process this data.
Customer support.
We process your personal data based on performance of contract as is necessary to manage our services by identifying and fixing bugs and to provide customer support and reply to your request. However, we may process your data based on our legitimate interests to analyze the app’s performance for improvement of our services. We always verify that our legitimate interests do not outweigh your privacy rights and interests.
Providing in app advertising.
Personalized ads in the app.
We process your personal data (including data related to your pregnancy) to provide you relevant and personalized advertising based on your explicit consent.

We rely on our legitimate interest to deliver non-personalized ads to you that are not relevant to your stage of pregnancy, and not tailored to your interests / preferences.
Improving our app and services.
We process your personal data based on our legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests involve improving our services and developing new solutions for society and for you in the personal health domain. We always verify that our legitimate interests do not outweigh your privacy rights and interests.
Allowing you to share your data with third parties.
We process and share your personal data with third parties based on your explicit consent (e.g., Business Partners; Personalized Ads in the App), or where you make an express request to us (e.g., Login using Third Party account credentials).

We collect, store, combine, analyse and apply automatic processing techniques like aggregation of information as well as manual (human) review, and share information, as necessary to research and innovate for social good in this way.
We support research in areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Sign in with Apple allows you to sign in to apps and websites while protecting your privacy.
Some developers may ask for your name, which you can edit. They may also ask for your email, which you can provide directly or use an alias.
Apple knows if you’ve enabled Sign in with Apple for an app or a website, but does not track what apps or websites you sign in to or when.
When you first use Sign in with Apple to sign in to an app, Apple uses information about your account and experiences with Apple, along with information about your device and device usage patterns, to help prevent fraud.
Enabling Sign in with Apple
Sign in with Apple protects your privacy by allowing you to sign in to an app (or App Clip) without having to provide the developer with information that personally identifies you. Sign in with Apple also allows you to sign in to a website without having to provide the developer with any additional information that personally identifies you beyond information used by your browser for normal web functions. Instead, when you use Sign in with Apple, Apple provides the app developer with a unique identifier, allowing you to keep your information private. This identifier is distinct for each app developer, to help prevent different developers from gathering and sharing information about you across apps. Developers can also let you use Sign in with Apple for existing accounts on their apps or websites. If a developer chooses to enable this, you can keep the account you have already but sign in to it using Sign in with Apple.
Because certain apps may have reason to collect more information about you — for example, to refer to your account by name or contact you by email — some developers may ask for your name or email address when you use Sign in with Apple. Your name will default to the name associated with your Apple Account, which you can edit before sharing with the developer. If the developer asks for an email address, you can choose to provide the developer with any of the email addresses associated with your Apple Account, or to hide your email address. If you choose to hide your email address from the developer, Apple will generate and provide the developer with a unique email address for them to use to communicate with you. Apple will forward email received at that address to an email address associated with your Apple Account; Apple deletes messages after delivery or after a short while if undeliverable. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can change the email address to which mail is forwarded, or disable email forwarding, by going to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > iCloud Mail > Mail Forwarding. On your Mac, go to System Settings > [your name] > Personal Information. When you deactivate and delete an email address used with Hide My Email, it is retained in association with your Apple Account for 30 days for purposes of abuse prevention. The removed address is thereafter permanently deleted from your Apple Account, and retained only for security purposes such as to prevent reissuing the address.
If you choose to enable Sign in with Apple for an app, that choice is linked to the Apple Account you use for iCloud, so that you can easily use Sign in with Apple for that app on all of your Apple devices.
For fraud prevention and security reasons, the first time you use Sign in with Apple with a new app, Apple will share a simple binary score with the developer to give them confidence that you are a real person. This score is derived from your recent Apple account activity along with abstracted information about your device and device usage patterns. Neither Apple nor the developer receives any specific information about how you use your device.
Using Sign in with Apple
Apple knows when you enable Sign in with Apple for an app or website so that we can help set up the sign-in. When you then use Sign in with Apple with an app on your iPhone, Apple does not see or retain a history of which apps you sign in to or when you use Sign in with Apple — that information stays on your device. When you use Sign in with Apple on Safari, Apple sees when you sign in to a website so that Apple can authenticate your sign in, but Apple does not retain a history of what websites you sign in to or when you use Sign in with Apple.
Even if you use Sign in with Apple to sign in to an app or website, developers can ask you for additional personal information after sign-in. Any personal information that you choose to provide to a developer is subject to their privacy policy.
Managing Sign in with Apple
To manage Sign in with Apple, go to Settings > [your name] > Sign-In & Security > Apps Using Your Apple Account on iOS, to System Settings > [your name] > Sign-In & Security on Mac, or visit
account.apple.com
and go to the Sign-In and Security section, then go to Sign in with Apple. There, you can find a list of the apps using Sign in with Apple, review their privacy policy, and disable Sign in with Apple. If you choose to disable Sign in with Apple for an app, information that was shared with the developer to set up Sign in with Apple for that app and any information that the developer associated with your Sign in with Apple account will continue to be handled according to the developer’s privacy policy.
More Information
Apple works to protect Sign in with Apple with strong authentication — powered by Touch ID, Face ID, and strong passcode options.
Apple may receive anonymous and aggregate information about Sign in with Apple, including information about the use of Sign in with Apple. None of the collected information identifies you personally. Apple may use information that does not identify you to improve Apple products and services, for marketing, and for fraud prevention and security purposes. Apple will not attempt to reidentify any anonymous or aggregated Sign in with Apple data we receive.
Apple will use your information as required by law and for fraud prevention. By using Sign in with Apple, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of your information as described above.
Apple retains personal information only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in Apple’s Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal information collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal information for the shortest possible period permissible under law.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at
www.apple.com/privacy

How Sign in with Google helps you share data safely
Your privacy is important. This article helps you understand how Google protects your privacy when you use Sign in with Google to share data with third parties.
With Sign in with Google, you can easily and securely sign in to third-party apps and services using your Google Account. Third parties are companies or developers that aren’t Google. Only share your data with third parties that you trust.
Keep in mind that:
You’re informed of the data that Google shares with the third party.
Sign in with Google doesn’t share your data without your permission.
You can stop using Sign in with Google to sign in to a third-party account at any time.
If you want to delete the data and information you shared with the third party, you’ll need to visit that third party.
Google doesn’t share your Google Account password with the third party.

What data Google shares
Important:
Sign in with Google doesn’t share your Google Account password.
When you use Sign in with Google to access a third-party app or service, Google only shares the following information associated with your Google Account:
Your name
Your email address
Your profile picture
This data is only shared after you give permission. If you want to use Sign in with Google, you can't exclude any of these pieces of data.
In addition to your name, email address, and profile picture, the third party might request further access to some of your Google Account data.

apps and services that request access to your Google Account data

How third parties use your data
Important:
Third-party apps or services may use your email address, name, and profile picture in other ways as described in their privacy policy or elsewhere.
Your email address may be used to create or sign in to an existing third-party account. For example, your email address can be used to:
Check whether you’ve already created an account with a third party.
Associate your Google Account with an existing third-party account.
Create a new account with the third party.
If you don’t already have an account with a third-party app or service, the third party can use your name and profile picture to create one.
What data the third party shares
When you use Sign in with Google, Google doesn’t receive access to your third-party account.
Tip:
Google doesn't use information or activity from Sign in with Google for ads or any other Google product.
How long your data is shared
How long the third party keeps your data depends on their data retention policy. To learn more about how the third party uses your data, go to their Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. You can find these documents:
On the third party’s app, service, or website
At the bottom of the consent screen the first time you sign in to the app with Sign in with Google
If you had previously given your consent, a third-party service can retrieve your basic profile information (name, email, profile picture) when you use Sign in with Google. You can update your Sign in with Google preferences in the Security section of your Google Account. After you remove your consent, you can’t use Sign in with Google on the app or service anymore.
If you remove consent, third-party sites and apps can’t access, share, or reshare any updates or changes to your basic profile information (name, email, profile picture). It doesn't take back data you already shared. You may need to ask them to delete the data they already have.
How Google helps protect your linked accounts
To protect your Google Account, our security technology helps detect suspicious events. When you connect your Google Account to apps or services that participate in Cross-Account Protection, we can notify them about suspicious events we detect. That way, third-party apps and services can use Google’s security technology to keep you safer online.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
