Information We Collect Directly From You.¬†The type of information that we collect from you depends on your interaction with our Site and Services.
You must create an account to purchase audiobooks or memberships from the Site. To create an account, you must provide your name, email address, country, postal code or zip code, and password. You can also choose to support a specific bookstore. ¬†We also may collect additional optional information from you such as how you heard about us and other contact information.

If you refer a friend, we will collect the contact information you provide and may provide you with referral credits.
Through its Audiobook Listening Copy (‚ÄúALC‚Äù) program, Libro.fm provides promotional copies of audiobooks to influencers, press, educators, librarians, and owners and employees of bookstore partners. If you apply for, or participate in, one of these ALC programs, we will collect your name and contact information and information to determine your qualification for the ALC program, including associated organizations, and social media channels for influencers. If you participate in one of the ALC programs, you agree that Libro.fm may share your name, organization, email address, social media and internet profiles, and ALC download activity with publishers and others as part of our ALC Program. The publisher‚Äôs use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy.
Libro.fm provides audiobooks to corporations and other organizations for distribution to employees and other recipients chosen by the organization. If you receive an audiobook from an organization, we may provide your name, email address and which book(s) you received to the organization in accordance with our agreement with the organization. The organization‚Äôs use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy.
Information We Collect Automatically.¬†We automatically collect the following information about your use of our Site or Services and your device through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your browser type and operating system; device information; web pages you view on our Site; links you click on our Site; your IP address; the length of time you visit our Site and or use our Services; and the referring URL or the webpage that led you to our Site. We will collect information about your purchases, quizzes, recommendations, preferences, playlists, and other activities on the Site and Services.
Cookies and Other Technologies
Like many websites, we employ "cookies" on the Site and Service to allow us to provide and improve your experience. Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser. Each user is assigned a ‚Äúcookie ID‚Äù from our Site domain in connection with the registration process. We use cookies, including your cookie ID, to store a user's log-in identity when you re-access the Site; to monitor irregular account behavior and to prevent fraud; and to generate and compile aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users navigate our Site and Service. You may refuse the use of certain cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser or device; however, if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site and Service.
Log Information
We also keep track of your interaction with the Site, Service and any other users. Specifically, our servers automatically record information that your browser (or our Service) sends whenever you interact with the Service. This information includes your Internet Protocol address (IP address), your cookie ID, your browser type and version, mobile operating system, mobile device type, app version, which aspects of Service you use and when and how long you use them, and how you otherwise access the Libro.fm Service.
Do-Not-Track
Currently, our Site and Services do not recognize browser ‚Äúdo-not-track‚Äù requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
Third-Party Analytics
Our Site and Services may use services operated by third parties, such as Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Sites and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google‚Äôs practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and you can opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt out browser add-on, available at ¬†https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Social Plugins
We use Instagram, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, YouTube, and Vimeo social plugins on our Site. When you view a web page that contains a plugin, your browser will create a direct link to the third parties‚Äô servers. If you are logged into your social media account, the social media platform will record the visit to your social media account. Please visit the social media platform‚Äôs privacy policy for more information.
Third-Party Ad Networks
We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party‚Äôs specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.
Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
Consumer Choice Page
for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices.
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA
Consumer Choice Page
will opt you out from those companies‚Äô delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA site, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA‚Äôs website at www.aboutads.info.
3. How we use your information

12. ¬†Jurisdiction Specific Supplementary Privacy Terms¬†-¬†Canada
The following additional provisions apply only to individuals who reside in Canada.‚Äé
CASL Policy.
We are committed to compliance with Canada‚Äôs Anti-Spam Legislation (‚ÄúCASL‚Äù). ¬†Any electronic ‚Äé‚Äécommunication we send to outside parties is protected by a range of business procedures, processes ‚Äé‚Äéand policies to ensure that such communication is done in compliance with CASL. In our electronic communications with outside parties, we comply with the rules established by CASL and enforced by ‚Äé‚Äévarious Canadian authorities including the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications ‚Äé‚ÄéCommission. CASL regulates, and our policies generally apply to, each commercial electronic message ‚Äé‚Äé‚Äé(a ‚ÄúCEM‚Äù) that we send. A CEM is an electronic message sent to an electronic address that, among its ‚Äé‚Äépurposes, encourages participation in a commercial activity.‚Äé
In addition to adopting and updating this CASL Policy, we undertake various transparency initiatives to ‚Äéensure ‚Äéwe comply with CASL, which include:‚Äé
Consent‚Äî we do not send you CEMs without your consent. This consent typically must be ‚Äé‚Äé‚Äúexpress‚Äù ‚Äé‚Äé(expressly acknowledged by you), but in certain circumstances can be ‚Äúimplied‚Äù or ‚Äéspecifically ‚Äéexempt from consent requirements. ¬†We modified or adopted our sign-up, ‚Äéregistration and ‚Äéconsent forms in order to ensure that your consent is meaningful (i.e. ‚Äéinformed and freely given) ‚Äéas per CASL. ¬†When we collect your electronic contact personal information, ‚Äéyou will know the ‚Äéexact purposes behind the collection.‚Äé
Content‚Äî we adopted processes to ensure that our CEMs contain the following requirements ‚Äé‚Äéprescribed under CASL, which will usually be in the footer of the CEM. We will:‚Äé
Identify ourselves as the party sending the CEM, and whether we are sending the message ‚Äé‚Äéon our own behalf or on behalf of someone else;‚Äé
Provide you with our contact personal information; and‚Äé
Set out a clear, working unsubscribe mechanism or preference centre that is easy to use, ‚Äé‚Äéautomatic, and at no cost to you (other than your own cost of connecting to the ‚ÄéInternet).‚Äé
Clarity‚Äî we ensured that each aspect of a CEM, including its header, content, or any links or URLs ‚Äé‚Äéin the CEM) conveys the appropriate personal information, whether viewed individually or taken ‚Äéas a ‚Äéwhole, so that you always know what you are clicking on.‚Äé
If you receive a CEM from us but believe that you should not have or no longer wish to receive CEMs, ‚Äéwe ‚Äéwill aim to respect your preferences in a timely manner once you update them through our ‚Äéunsubscribe ‚Äémechanism. CASL requires us to process unsubscribe requests within 10 business days. ¬†If ‚Äéyou have any ‚Äéquestions or concerns about our unsubscribe options, you may contact us at the address ‚Äéindicated in ‚ÄéSection 11 of the Privacy Policy above.‚Äé
