As a provider of innovative K-12 software and cloud-based solutions to improve educational outcomes and simplify school operations, central to our operations is the processing of personal data, PowerSchool places
great importance
and value on the proper handling of personal data that flows within our product as we
provide
services to our customers. We use the following Privacy Principles as a guide, and they inform our approach to data privacy and data protection throughout PowerSchool.

At PowerSchool, starting from the collection of personal data, and subsequent processing that follows, we ensure there is at least one legal basis for each of the processing activities we engage in. Such bases include the performance of a contract, your consent, a legitimate interest/purpose that we pursue, performing a legal obligation, etc.
Fairness
Fairness connotes different things to different people. At PowerSchool, we use personal data in a legal and non-harmful way while respecting your rights and considering your interests. Personal data is processed fairly and reasonably by PowerSchool. By “reasonably”, we mean processing all personal data in ways that our customers knowingly expect and not processing in ways unexpected or unauthorized by our customers - schools and school districts. By "fairness" we mean all personal data we process is processed in the same or substantially similar manner.
Control
With this transparency, you can determine whether you agree to the processing of your personal data as directed by the data controller, (typically a school, district or higher educational institution who is a customer of PowerSchool).

In this Global Privacy Statement, we provide you with relevant information concerning the processing of your personal data in PowerSchool applications.  Your personal data will be processed in an open, simple, and plain manner.  Most typically personal data is processed in the form of student education records under the control of your school or district (the “data controller”). We provide information such as what personal data will be processed within our applications, how personal data may be collected from you by a data controller (such as your school or district), for what purpose PowerSchool may process the personal data on behalf of the data controller, how long it will be kept, etc.

As stated in our Global Privacy Statement, we only process collected personal data for the specified, legitimate business purpose we stated before or at the point of collection of the personal data. We thus do not use personal data for any purpose beyond what we have informed or pre-disclosed to our customers and users. We ensure that any change in the purpose of how we use personal data (secondary purpose) is compatible with the initial purpose (primary purpose) disclosed to our customers for which personal data was collected. Where a secondary purpose is not compatible with the primary purpose, we take steps to inform you and ensure or obtain a new basis for the processing of personal data for the secondary purpose before commencing the processing of personal data.

As PowerSchool offers several products to drive our mission to empower educators, administrators and families to support students to learn in the way that’s right for them.   From the conception of any of our products, privacy considerations are embedded into the design, and this is reflected in our final products pushed to our customers. We build privacy as the default setting in our products, ensure end-to-end security, and exemplify respect for user privacy in all our products. This privacy-oriented product-building initiative is also reflected in our services and business practices.

PowerSchool retains personal data only for as long as necessary to advance the processing purpose for which personal data has been provided to us or disclosed to us by a user. As a guide, we use a business or legal purpose to determine how long we retain your personal data, and when such business or legal purpose expires, we delete your personal data appropriately. We also ensure a Data Retention Policy is in place for all processing activities, and we periodically review processed personal data to determine deletion and ensure personal data is not kept longer than necessary.

state-of-the-art
, and
appropriate physical
, technical, and administrative security measures to protect the personal data that we process. You can find further information in our Global Privacy Statement under Commitment to Protecting Your Data.
Who controls the content/data on PowerSchool products?
+
Depending on the content/data in question, who
owns
or controls differs depending upon the product. For our Cloud Offerings and Platform Capabilities, the licensed
customer
of our applications, typically schools and
district
, are the data controllers of the data, student educational records, processed in these applications. For the publicly
accessible products, PowerSchool acts as the data controller of the data collected.  If you are the data subject, you may direct your requests to exercise any data privacy rights you may via the applicable data controller.  PowerSchool may have the right to anonymize/de-
identify
data.  PowerSchool
also may
use data relating to your usage of our products, usage analytics, to improve our products, including research and development, etc
.  Such
Transaction Data is owned by PowerSchool.
Does PowerSchool sell my data?
+
No. PowerSchool is bound by the instructions from our customers and the terms of our contract and data privacy agreements which do not include the right to sell the data captured in any PowerSchool products.
Does PowerSchool share my data without consent?
+
No. Our customers (school and school districts) have the responsibility to obtain voluntary and informed consent from data subjects to collect and process personal data, unless excepted under applicable law. PowerSchool obtains consent from our customers for the use of third-party subprocessors, who support the functionality of our applications and who are required to execute appropriate data privacy agreements.
How does PowerSchool use my Personal Data?

jurisdiction
outside of the United States or Canada. To cater to this, we always enter into a Data Processing Agreement with
all of
our service providers – imposing a duty on them to process the personal data we have transferred to them securely including when they store or process the personal data in another location/
jurisdiction
.
When does a data subject need to refer to PowerSchool Global Privacy Statement?
+

+
Student data is synonymous with Customer Data under this Privacy Statement. Accordingly, all Customer Data is owned, and thereby controlled, by our customers (school, school districts or higher education institutions). Our customers have the responsibility to obtain voluntary and informed consent from data subjects to collect and process personal data, unless excepted under applicable law. PowerSchool will only process student data for the purposes of providing access to the PowerSchool Products and professional services that our customers (school or school districts) have contracted with us to provide, and we will process such student data according to instructions and the terms of our contract and data privacy agreements with our customers. This Global Privacy Statement is our commitment to ensuring the respect for global data privacy rights.
Is PowerSchool a “data controller” or a “data processor”?
+
PowerSchool is a “data processor” to its customers, who are educational institutions. A “data processor” is an entity that operates a service that processes data based on the instructions of and at the request of a data controller. PowerSchool does not have the same obligations as a data controller to obtain consent from the data subjects. For “publicly accessible products”, which are identified further in the global privacy statement are not licensed to educational institutions, PowerSchool does act as the data controller.
How are data subject requests concerning Customer Data and Collected Data handled at PowerSchool?
+
Under global privacy laws, it is the data controller who is responsible for responding to any exercise of a data subject right regarding the personal data collected. Nevertheless, an end user may elect to submit a DSAR (data subject access request) directly with PowerSchool at the link shown in section XIV of the global privacy statement. As the data processor, PowerSchool will transfer the validated request to the applicable data controller. In certain cases, PowerSchool may directly respond to the DSAR.

PowerSchool

Customer Data
”) provided to us by our K-12 or higher education institutional customers (educational institutions) to process on their behalf when they, their staff, parents/guardians, and students access and use our products, including mobile services.  This Statement also provides information how PowerSchool may collect personal information (“
Collected Data

PowerSchool categorizes the data into 3 categories: Customer Data, Collected Data and Transaction Data.
Customer data which is the data received by PowerSchool from its customers and customer users and is processed by PowerSchool on behalf of the customer in our capacity as “data processor”.  Collected data which means the personal information collected by PowerSchool directly from the users of our Publicly Accessible Products.  Transaction data, also known as metadata, this data generated by PowerSchool software using PowerSchool Products and services and is proprietary to PowerSchool.

PowerSchool customers are mainly K through 12 schools and districts, and higher education institutions.  The makeup of Customer Data processed by PowerSchool can vary by PowerSchool service and a customer’s product configuration.  PowerSchool provides a full spectrum of education-related services for customers to choose from.  These include K-12 education technology products, higher education products, and administration products.  Customers may have one or more of these PowerSchool products and services.  Depending on the product or service, Customers may provide student data, employee data, or applicant data for PowerSchool processing.  The mix of data provided by each customer may also vary based on how the customer configures the PowerSchool product or service for Customer Data collection (potential variations are discussed in more detail below). For this reason, it is impossible for PowerSchool to fully document the data that it will process for each customer until after the customer has fully implemented and configured the PowerSchool product and service.  The configuration may also be dynamic in that the school or district may change its data collection configuration over time.  If you have questions about which data is being collected by a customer connected to you, you should direct those questions directly to the PowerSchool customer that controls your data.  The customer’s privacy policy may be another good source of information.
Many school districts are also obligated to parents to post information about the data that these institutions may collect.  It bears mentioning again that PowerSchool processes the Customer Data under strict contractual obligations and privacy agreements signed with the customer.  PowerSchool does not use or disclose Customer Data except as authorized and required by our customers and as provided for in our agreements with our customers. Because PowerSchool does not own or control Customer Data, any request for access, review, correction, or deletion of Customer Data must come directly from our customers. With our customer’s consent, PowerSchool may receive information from affiliates in our PowerSchool Group of companies, or third parties and combine that information with Customer Data.

Although most PowerSchool on-line services and products are used by customers for Customer Data collection, PowerSchool websites and some PowerSchool products and services collect data directly from users of our website or those products and services.  In these situations, PowerSchool is a “data controller” because PowerSchool determines the purposes for which and the way personal information is processed.  Because PowerSchool is the collector and controls the configuration of these products and services, PowerSchool can provide more detail on the data collection.  These websites, products and services are further detailed below.
We also collect device and usage information when you access and use PowerSchool Products, including information that your browser or the mobile app sends when you are using our products. This data may include your unique device identifier, IP address, your browser type and configuration, the date and time of your use of the product or service and cookie data.

Transaction Data is not Customer Data, nor is it Collected Data. It is a different PowerSchool category of data. Transaction Data may contain copied elements from Customer Data or Collected Data.  For example, the logging of a user session may contain a unique id that identifies the user.  The unique id is necessary for monitoring the health and security of PowerSchool applications.
The monitoring of PowerSchool systems and applications is a part of our standard business operations to protect Customer Data and Collected Data; comply with laws; be able to provide customer support, and monitor events related to Customer Data or Collected Data. The monitoring of events is essential in preventing data-related incidents and determining if a data-related incident has occurred or is occurring that requires immediate attention by PowerSchool’s Incident Response Team.  System and application events are monitored by the creation of artifacts or metadata about our systems, applications and their use. We call this “Transaction Data”.  Transaction Data is vital to our ability to improve our products; trouble shoot customer support questions; analyze the health and performance of our products; and maintain security of Customer Data and Collected data, and privacy investigations.  Transaction Data may either contain personal information along with application data that does not directly or indirectly relate to a person; or application data without any personal information at all.
The storage and maintenance of Transaction Data is separate from the storage and maintenance of Customer Data and Collected Data with clear boundaries between the three types of data. In fact, Transaction Data is temporary. This means Transaction Data is permanently deleted on a regular rolling basis over time. This occurs regardless of whether Transaction Data contains any personal information or not. This is an implementation of the data minimization principle.  Transaction Data which contains no personal information or Transaction Data containing even one element of personal information are all treated the same.  Except for Service Providers acting as data subprocessors supporting our applications who are granted secure access to Transaction Data, PowerSchool does not share, disclose, sell or transfer such Transaction Data.  Additionally, PowerSchool treats all Transaction Data as PowerSchool Restricted Information – meaning confidential and secured – and at the same level as Customer Data and Collected Data.
PowerSchool does work with various data subprocessors to support the operability of our products.  For these vendors to service us as captured in our agreements with them, they do create metadata within their systems.  In these cases, PowerSchool binds these vendors to privacy requirements to ensure any metadata is properly deleted as required by law.
PowerSchool respects our customers’ privacy and data security requirements. Transaction Data is one way we fulfill that promise to our customers – educational institutions and individuals. Transaction Data provides us with the ability to service our customers properly.

Whether PowerSchool is a collector or processor or your data, PowerSchool is committed to protecting your personal information.  PowerSchool uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal information. Our systems are regularly certified by third parties against industry security standards from AIPCA and ISO.  As customers provide PowerSchool with Customer Data to process, PowerSchool makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.  Please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, administrative, and technical safeguards.
Regardless of whether the data is Customer Data or Collected Data, both are covered under PowerSchool’s privacy program.  PowerSchool supports privacy rights and has developed and implemented policies, processes, procedures, and technologies for the collection, processing, use, and protection of your data whether it is collected by a customer or us.  We are also a signatory of the 2020 Student Privacy Pledge.
How is your personal information protected?
PowerSchool employs a variety of physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to protect your data against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. We strive to continuously maintain reasonable physical, administrative, and technical security measures. Our security measures consider the type and sensitivity of the data being collected, used, and stored, and the current state of technology and threats to data. PowerSchool independently verifies its security management system to the internationally recognized standard for security management and holds ISO 27001 and SOC2 certifications. PowerSchool also endeavors to align its privacy and security operations to best practices and relevant international regulations.

VI.
Product Performance Monitoring.
When you interact or use any PowerSchool licensed products, we use an information-gathering tool for collecting data that may contain Personal Information (in one of the use cases discussed further below) as you navigate our products or web properties. PowerSchool uses product experience software to monitor and improve the customer experience accessing   our products. With product experience software monitoring the usage of our products, PowerSchool can track customers’ usage patterns on our products, measure product performance, analyze customer churn rates for greater understanding of customers’/users’ needs and preferences, procure feedback from users/customers, carry out marketing activities, etc.
PowerSchool does not track or monitor an individual’s activity outside of the individual’s use of PowerSchool products or website properties. This means we do not store tracking cookies on a user’s browser to build a profile of what you may do on the internet or to identify you when they visit our web properties or use our products. PowerSchool does implement activity monitoring tools to help detect and mitigate insider threats, whether unintentional or with malicious intent. Generally, the range of monitoring and methods utilized depends on each specific objective described in the use cases below.
A. Aggregated Monitoring
In this use case, PowerSchool monitors, at an aggregate anonymized level, how users from a customer, school or district, interact with our products to improve our product and the user experience.  These actions are not leveraged for any other reason than as stated in this Global Privacy Statement.
PowerSchool uses its product experience software to gather metrics on PowerSchool product usage, and products’ most-used feature(s). Importantly, as mentioned above, the generated data are at the aggregate level, and are not traceable to an individual.  This holds true for pseudonymized data disclosed to our data subprocessor vendors leveraged to enable our services. These vendors do not have access to the data that could identify the user.
PowerSchool monitors certain data associated with identified users within the product’s unique infrastructure solely to monitor the technical performance of its platforms and to improve the design of our products. Any logs or records of such tracking are deleted, and not shared or disclosed outside of PowerSchool in any non-aggregated, individually identifiable way other than to the specific licensed customer, who is the data controller of the data.
Please be aware that schools or districts may elect to monitor their user engagement on a platform, such as Naviance CCLR, for district and statewide reporting and monitoring of CCLR progress.  No product experience software is used to process Customer Data.
B. Product Feedback Requests
In addition to the above use case on aggregated monitoring of product performance, PowerSchool uses its product experience software to support efforts to obtain voluntarily provided feedback from customers of our products or visitors to our web properties. Those instances are detailed below:
We present customers and users of our platforms with a request to opt in to participate in future research activities related to our product development. Upon receipt of an opt-in, we collect the individual’s contact email to send further information surrounding the upcoming research activity. The personal information we collect here includes the user’s name, and email address, although, we also collect the name of the product the user is using or intends to provide feedback on. We use a consent management tool to facilitate the communication of research questionnaires only to users who have opted-in to receive such research-related communication. Every such communication has an unsubscribe link, allowing for the revocation of a previously provided opt-in. Additionally, when we send research-related communications to opted-in individuals and do not receive a response within a limited period, PowerSchool refrains from sending any further communications to such user/customer.
We also present anonymous surveys to users and licensees of our products. Responses to the survey questionnaire are anonymous and cannot be traced to any individual. For these surveys we do not collect any personal information.  The focus is only on feedback related to product usages and suggestions/reactions to product features.
Additionally, we may present prescribed survey questions with defined answer options. In this way, responses are void of any personal information being collected and processed by PowerSchool.  As an example, we may ask if a user likes a (newly added) feature or page.  If a user chooses “No” for their answer, for example, we then present restricted answers such as “I don’t like this page because it is too long”, “I don’t like this page because it has too many options”, etc.
In all the use cases discussed above (Aggregated Monitoring, and Feedback Requests), PowerSchool uses tools that have undergone security and privacy review. Moreover, the service provider is also subjected to the rigorous PowerSchool third-party risk management program before their services are engaged.

India in August 2023 enacted its new privacy law—the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act). Once the DPDP Act, is in full force, which awaits a commencement date set by the Indian Central Government, it will supersede specific provisions of the existing Information Technology Act of 2000, Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008, and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011. Importantly, the DPDP Act recognizes the right of individuals to protect their personal data collected digitally or collected physically and later converted to digital. DPDP Act casts a duty on the Data Fiduciary (person who shall be liable to collect data) to send notices to obtain free consent from the Data Principals (individual's whose personal data is processed). The Notice should contain details of (i) what data will be collected, (ii) how it will be processed and (iii) where the end data upon processing would be used. The DPDP Act puts additional consent requirements from the parents/ lawful guardians for processing data of children or persons with disabilities. The DPDP Act once enforceable would be administered by the Data Protection Board of India. PowerSchool is monitoring for the DPDP act to be enforced and to understand the implementation and it impacts on our services to our customers (schools/districts) and data subjects whose personal data is processed by our services

Post-Brexit, the GDPR, 2018 is not applicable to UK.  Instead, the data privacy law in UK, the Data Protection Act, 2018 – which was a domestication and implementation of the GDPR when the UK was still part of the EU, controls how businesses process personal data. It imposes the duty on every person using personal data to comply with the seven ‘data protection principles’. The Act provides the UK citizens numerous rights over their data as used by government, businesses, and private organizations.   Through our agreements with our customers and our internal processes, PowerSchool complies with this Act as a data processor to our customers who engage directly with data subjects. or are impacted by our customers’ use of our services.

The existence of United States federal laws such as Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) drive the data privacy rights and protection requirements for student education records. Recently, the United States has experienced an explosion in the number of state-level data privacy laws protecting personal data of individuals. PowerSchool works to understand and to comply with each of these laws as we act as a data processor for student educational records.

PowerSchool’s Privacy Principles
As a provider of innovative K-12 software and cloud-based solutions to improve educational outcomes and simplify school operations, central to our operations is the processing of personal data, PowerSchool places
great importance
and value on the proper handling of personal data that flows within our product as we
provide
services to our customers. We use the following Privacy Principles as a guide, and they inform our approach to data privacy and data protection throughout PowerSchool.

At PowerSchool, starting from the collection of personal data, and subsequent processing that follows, we ensure there is at least one legal basis for each of the processing activities we engage in. Such bases include the performance of a contract, your consent, a legitimate interest/purpose that we pursue, performing a legal obligation, etc.
Fairness
Fairness connotes different things to different people. At PowerSchool, we use personal data in a legal and non-harmful way while respecting your rights and considering your interests. Personal data is processed fairly and reasonably by PowerSchool. By “reasonably”, we mean processing all personal data in ways that our customers knowingly expect and not processing in ways unexpected or unauthorized by our customers - schools and school districts. By "fairness" we mean all personal data we process is processed in the same or substantially similar manner.
Control
With this transparency, you can determine whether you agree to the processing of your personal data as directed by the data controller, (typically a school, district or higher educational institution who is a customer of PowerSchool).

In this Global Privacy Statement, we provide you with relevant information concerning the processing of your personal data in PowerSchool applications.  Your personal data will be processed in an open, simple, and plain manner.  Most typically personal data is processed in the form of student education records under the control of your school or district (the “data controller”). We provide information such as what personal data will be processed within our applications, how personal data may be collected from you by a data controller (such as your school or district), for what purpose PowerSchool may process the personal data on behalf of the data controller, how long it will be kept, etc.

As stated in our Global Privacy Statement, we only process collected personal data for the specified, legitimate business purpose we stated before or at the point of collection of the personal data. We thus do not use personal data for any purpose beyond what we have informed or pre-disclosed to our customers and users. We ensure that any change in the purpose of how we use personal data (secondary purpose) is compatible with the initial purpose (primary purpose) disclosed to our customers for which personal data was collected. Where a secondary purpose is not compatible with the primary purpose, we take steps to inform you and ensure or obtain a new basis for the processing of personal data for the secondary purpose before commencing the processing of personal data.

As PowerSchool offers several products to drive our mission to empower educators, administrators and families to support students to learn in the way that’s right for them.   From the conception of any of our products, privacy considerations are embedded into the design, and this is reflected in our final products pushed to our customers. We build privacy as the default setting in our products, ensure end-to-end security, and exemplify respect for user privacy in all our products. This privacy-oriented product-building initiative is also reflected in our services and business practices.

PowerSchool retains personal data only for as long as necessary to advance the processing purpose for which personal data has been provided to us or disclosed to us by a user. As a guide, we use a business or legal purpose to determine how long we retain your personal data, and when such business or legal purpose expires, we delete your personal data appropriately. We also ensure a Data Retention Policy is in place for all processing activities, and we periodically review processed personal data to determine deletion and ensure personal data is not kept longer than necessary.

deleted

How does PowerSchool protect my Personal Data?
+
We use
state-of-the-art
, and
appropriate physical
, technical, and administrative security measures to protect the personal data that we process. You can find further information in our Global Privacy Statement under Commitment to Protecting Your Data.
Who controls the content/data on PowerSchool products?
+
Depending on the content/data in question, who
owns
or controls differs depending upon the product. For our Cloud Offerings and Platform Capabilities, the licensed
customer
of our applications, typically schools and
district
, are the data controllers of the data, student educational records, processed in these applications. For the publicly
accessible products, PowerSchool acts as the data controller of the data collected.  If you are the data subject, you may direct your requests to exercise any data privacy rights you may via the applicable data controller.  PowerSchool may have the right to anonymize/de-
identify
data.  PowerSchool
also may
use data relating to your usage of our products, usage analytics, to improve our products, including research and development, etc
.  Such
Transaction Data is owned by PowerSchool.
Does PowerSchool sell my data?
+
No. PowerSchool is bound by the instructions from our customers and the terms of our contract and data privacy agreements which do not include the right to sell the data captured in any PowerSchool products.
Does PowerSchool share my data without consent?
+
No. Our customers (school and school districts) have the responsibility to obtain voluntary and informed consent from data subjects to collect and process personal data, unless excepted under applicable law. PowerSchool obtains consent from our customers for the use of third-party subprocessors, who support the functionality of our applications and who are required to execute appropriate data privacy agreements.
How does PowerSchool use my Personal Data?
+

+

leverage
third party cloud providers to support certain of our applications.  Where we use a service provider for a product offering, the service provider may store your personal data in another location/
jurisdiction
outside of the United States or Canada. To cater to this, we always enter into a Data Processing Agreement with
all of
our service providers – imposing a duty on them to process the personal data we have transferred to them securely including when they store or process the personal data in another location/
jurisdiction
.
When does a data subject need to refer to PowerSchool Global Privacy Statement?
+
When the data subject wishes to understand PowerSchool’s commitment to global data privacy. PowerSchool’s Global Privacy Statement does not supersede the terms of any consent form or privacy notice from your applicable school, school district or higher education institution.
Who Owns Student Data Provided to PowerSchool by Customers for Processing?
+
Student data is synonymous with Customer Data under this Privacy Statement. Accordingly, all Customer Data is owned, and thereby controlled, by our customers (school, school districts or higher education institutions). Our customers have the responsibility to obtain voluntary and informed consent from data subjects to collect and process personal data, unless excepted under applicable law. PowerSchool will only process student data for the purposes of providing access to the PowerSchool Products and professional services that our customers (school or school districts) have contracted with us to provide, and we will process such student data according to instructions and the terms of our contract and data privacy agreements with our customers. This Global Privacy Statement is our commitment to ensuring the respect for global data privacy rights.
Is PowerSchool a “data controller” or a “data processor”?
+
PowerSchool is a “data processor” to its customers, who are educational institutions. A “data processor” is an entity that operates a service that processes data based on the instructions of and at the request of a data controller. PowerSchool does not have the same obligations as a data controller to obtain consent from the data subjects. For “publicly accessible products”, which are identified further in the global privacy statement are not licensed to educational institutions, PowerSchool does act as the data controller.
How are data subject requests concerning Customer Data and Collected Data handled at PowerSchool?
+
Under global privacy laws, it is the data controller who is responsible for responding to any exercise of a data subject right regarding the personal data collected. Nevertheless, an end user may elect to submit a DSAR (data subject access request) directly with PowerSchool at the link shown in section XIV of the global privacy statement. As the data processor, PowerSchool will transfer the validated request to the applicable data controller. In certain cases, PowerSchool may directly respond to the DSAR.

Customer Data

PowerSchool categorizes the data into 3 categories: Customer Data, Collected Data and Transaction Data.
Customer data which is the data received by PowerSchool from its customers and customer users and is processed by PowerSchool on behalf of the customer in our capacity as “data processor”.  Collected data which means the personal information collected by PowerSchool directly from the users of our Publicly Accessible Products.

PowerSchool customers are mainly K through 12 schools and districts, and higher education institutions.  The makeup of Customer Data processed by PowerSchool can vary by PowerSchool service and a customer’s product configuration.  PowerSchool provides a full spectrum of education-related services for customers to choose from.  These include K-12 education technology products, higher education products, and administration products.  Customers may have one or more of these PowerSchool products and services.  Depending on the product or service, Customers may provide student data, employee data, or applicant data for PowerSchool processing.  The mix of data provided by each customer may also vary based on how the customer configures the PowerSchool product or service for Customer Data collection (potential variations are discussed in more detail below). For this reason, it is impossible for PowerSchool to fully document the data that it will process for each customer until after the customer has fully implemented and configured the PowerSchool product and service.  The configuration may also be dynamic in that the school or district may change its data collection configuration over time.  If you have questions about which data is being collected by a customer connected to you, you should direct those questions directly to the PowerSchool customer that controls your data.  The customer’s privacy policy may be another good source of information.
Many school districts are also obligated to parents to post information about the data that these institutions may collect.  It bears mentioning again that PowerSchool processes the Customer Data under strict contractual obligations and privacy agreements signed with the customer.  PowerSchool does not use or disclose Customer Data except as authorized and required by our customers and as provided for in our agreements with our customers. Because PowerSchool does not own or control Customer Data, any request for access, review, correction, or deletion of Customer Data must come directly from our customers. With our customer’s consent, PowerSchool may receive information from affiliates in our PowerSchool Group of companies, or third parties and combine that information with Customer Data.

Although most PowerSchool on-line services and products are used by customers for Customer Data collection, PowerSchool websites and some PowerSchool products and services collect data directly from users of our website or those products and services.  In these situations, PowerSchool is a “data controller” because PowerSchool determines the purposes for which and the way personal information is processed.  Because PowerSchool is the collector and controls the configuration of these products and services, PowerSchool can provide more detail on the data collection.  These websites, products and services are further detailed below.
We also collect device and usage information when you access and use PowerSchool Products, including information that your browser or the mobile app sends when you are using our products. This data may include your unique device identifier, IP address, your browser type and configuration, the date and time of your use of the product or service and cookie data.

Transaction Data is not Customer Data, nor is it Collected Data. It is a different PowerSchool category of data. Transaction Data may contain copied elements from Customer Data or Collected Data.  For example, the logging of a user session may contain a unique id that identifies the user.  The unique id is necessary for monitoring the health and security of PowerSchool applications.
The monitoring of PowerSchool systems and applications is a part of our standard business operations to protect Customer Data and Collected Data; comply with laws; be able to provide customer support, and monitor events related to Customer Data or Collected Data. The monitoring of events is essential in preventing data-related incidents and determining if a data-related incident has occurred or is occurring that requires immediate attention by PowerSchool’s Incident Response Team.  System and application events are monitored by the creation of artifacts or metadata about our systems, applications and their use. We call this “Transaction Data”.  Transaction Data is vital to our ability to improve our products; trouble shoot customer support questions; analyze the health and performance of our products; and maintain security of Customer Data and Collected data, and privacy investigations.  Transaction Data may either contain personal information along with application data that does not directly or indirectly relate to a person; or application data without any personal information at all.
The storage and maintenance of Transaction Data is separate from the storage and maintenance of Customer Data and Collected Data with clear boundaries between the three types of data. In fact, Transaction Data is temporary. This means Transaction Data is permanently deleted on a regular rolling basis over time. This occurs regardless of whether Transaction Data contains any personal information or not. This is an implementation of the data minimization principle.  Transaction Data which contains no personal information or Transaction Data containing even one element of personal information are all treated the same.  Except for Service Providers acting as data subprocessors supporting our applications who are granted secure access to Transaction Data, PowerSchool does not share, disclose, sell or transfer such Transaction Data.  Additionally, PowerSchool treats all Transaction Data as PowerSchool Restricted Information – meaning confidential and secured – and at the same level as Customer Data and Collected Data.
PowerSchool does work with various data subprocessors to support the operability of our products.  For these vendors to service us as captured in our agreements with them, they do create metadata within their systems.  In these cases, PowerSchool binds these vendors to privacy requirements to ensure any metadata is properly deleted as required by law.
PowerSchool respects our customers’ privacy and data security requirements. Transaction Data is one way we fulfill that promise to our customers – educational institutions and individuals. Transaction Data provides us with the ability to service our customers properly.

Whether PowerSchool is a collector or processor or your data, PowerSchool is committed to protecting your personal information.  PowerSchool uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal information. Our systems are regularly certified by third parties against industry security standards from AIPCA and ISO.  As customers provide PowerSchool with Customer Data to process, PowerSchool makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.  Please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, administrative, and technical safeguards.
Regardless of whether the data is Customer Data or Collected Data, both are covered under PowerSchool’s privacy program.  PowerSchool supports privacy rights and has developed and implemented policies, processes, procedures, and technologies for the collection, processing, use, and protection of your data whether it is collected by a customer or us.  We are also a signatory of the 2020 Student Privacy Pledge.
How is your personal information protected?
PowerSchool employs a variety of physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to protect your data against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. We strive to continuously maintain reasonable physical, administrative, and technical security measures. Our security measures consider the type and sensitivity of the data being collected, used, and stored, and the current state of technology and threats to data. PowerSchool independently verifies its security management system to the internationally recognized standard for security management and holds ISO 27001 and SOC2 certifications. PowerSchool also endeavors to align its privacy and security operations to best practices and relevant international regulations.

In the event  PowerSchool goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, sale of all or a portion of its assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change (including during the course of any due diligence process), this personal information may be shared or transferred based on consent of our customers.
Our customers, educational institutions, may share personal information of students with educators as needed for educational purposes.  PowerSchool does not control and is not responsible for this type of sharing.  If you are a parent and have questions about this, please contact your child’s educational institution.

VI.
Product Performance Monitoring.
When you interact or use any PowerSchool licensed products, we use an information-gathering tool for collecting data that may contain Personal Information (in one of the use cases discussed further below) as you navigate our products or web properties. PowerSchool uses product experience software to monitor and improve the customer experience accessing   our products. With product experience software monitoring the usage of our products, PowerSchool can track customers’ usage patterns on our products, measure product performance, analyze customer churn rates for greater understanding of customers’/users’ needs and preferences, procure feedback from users/customers, carry out marketing activities, etc.
PowerSchool does not track or monitor an individual’s activity outside of the individual’s use of PowerSchool products or website properties. This means we do not store tracking cookies on a user’s browser to build a profile of what you may do on the internet or to identify you when they visit our web properties or use our products. PowerSchool does implement activity monitoring tools to help detect and mitigate insider threats, whether unintentional or with malicious intent. Generally, the range of monitoring and methods utilized depends on each specific objective described in the use cases below.
A. Aggregated Monitoring
In this use case, PowerSchool monitors, at an aggregate anonymized level, how users from a customer, school or district, interact with our products to improve our product and the user experience.  These actions are not leveraged for any other reason than as stated in this Global Privacy Statement.
PowerSchool uses its product experience software to gather metrics on PowerSchool product usage, and products’ most-used feature(s). Importantly, as mentioned above, the generated data are at the aggregate level, and are not traceable to an individual.  This holds true for pseudonymized data disclosed to our data subprocessor vendors leveraged to enable our services. These vendors do not have access to the data that could identify the user.
PowerSchool monitors certain data associated with identified users within the product’s unique infrastructure solely to monitor the technical performance of its platforms and to improve the design of our products. Any logs or records of such tracking are deleted, and not shared or disclosed outside of PowerSchool in any non-aggregated, individually identifiable way other than to the specific licensed customer, who is the data controller of the data.
Please be aware that schools or districts may elect to monitor their user engagement on a platform, such as Naviance CCLR, for district and statewide reporting and monitoring of CCLR progress.  No product experience software is used to process Customer Data.
B. Product Feedback Requests
In addition to the above use case on aggregated monitoring of product performance, PowerSchool uses its product experience software to support efforts to obtain voluntarily provided feedback from customers of our products or visitors to our web properties. Those instances are detailed below:
We present customers and users of our platforms with a request to opt in to participate in future research activities related to our product development. Upon receipt of an opt-in, we collect the individual’s contact email to send further information surrounding the upcoming research activity. The personal information we collect here includes the user’s name, and email address, although, we also collect the name of the product the user is using or intends to provide feedback on. We use a consent management tool to facilitate the communication of research questionnaires only to users who have opted-in to receive such research-related communication. Every such communication has an unsubscribe link, allowing for the revocation of a previously provided opt-in. Additionally, when we send research-related communications to opted-in individuals and do not receive a response within a limited period, PowerSchool refrains from sending any further communications to such user/customer.
We also present anonymous surveys to users and licensees of our products. Responses to the survey questionnaire are anonymous and cannot be traced to any individual. For these surveys we do not collect any personal information.  The focus is only on feedback related to product usages and suggestions/reactions to product features.
Additionally, we may present prescribed survey questions with defined answer options. In this way, responses are void of any personal information being collected and processed by PowerSchool.  As an example, we may ask if a user likes a (newly added) feature or page.  If a user chooses “No” for their answer, for example, we then present restricted answers such as “I don’t like this page because it is too long”, “I don’t like this page because it has too many options”, etc.
In all the use cases discussed above (Aggregated Monitoring, and Feedback Requests), PowerSchool uses tools that have undergone security and privacy review. Moreover, the service provider is also subjected to the rigorous PowerSchool third-party risk management program before their services are engaged.

India in August 2023 enacted its new privacy law—the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act). Once the DPDP Act, is in full force, which awaits a commencement date set by the Indian Central Government, it will supersede specific provisions of the existing Information Technology Act of 2000, Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008, and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011. Importantly, the DPDP Act recognizes the right of individuals to protect their personal data collected digitally or collected physically and later converted to digital. DPDP Act casts a duty on the Data Fiduciary (person who shall be liable to collect data) to send notices to obtain free consent from the Data Principals (individual's whose personal data is processed). The Notice should contain details of (i) what data will be collected, (ii) how it will be processed and (iii) where the end data upon processing would be used. The DPDP Act puts additional consent requirements from the parents/ lawful guardians for processing data of children or persons with disabilities. The DPDP Act once enforceable would be administered by the Data Protection Board of India. PowerSchool is monitoring for the DPDP act to be enforced and to understand the implementation and it impacts on our services to our customers (schools/districts) and data subjects whose personal data is processed by our services

Unlike the GDPR in EU, the Latin American countries do not have any standard law for the data privacy. While some of the countries have enacted their data privacy laws, like Brazil has LGPD Law, Ecuador’s the Organic Law on Personal Data Protection, 2021; Peru’s Personal Data Protection Law 2011, etc., the other Latin American countries are either developing their own data protection Laws or adopting the GDPR. PowerSchool is actively engaged to further understand these laws and their implementation as it impacts our services to our customers (schools/districts) and data subjects whose personal data is processed by our services.

The privacy laws in Middle East countries vary; however, they follow the Islamic principles and recognize the right of personal privacy. Privacy laws in the Middle East place restrictions on the collection and use of personal data, and provide individuals with the right to access, rectification, erasure, and data portability. Personal Data Protection Law, Federal Decree Law No. 45 of 2021 of UAE ensures confidentiality of information and protection of the privacy of citizens of UAE and prohibits the processing of Personal Data without obtaining the consent of the Data Subject. PowerSchool works diligently to both understand the implications of these new laws and comply to the extent they impact our customers’ use of our services.

The Privacy laws in Southeast Asia are clear and cast the obligation on organizations collecting/ processing data to obtain consent of the data subject, secure the data and provide access to personal data to the data subject. The Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA), Singapore, applies to any organization which has customer or users in Singapore. Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) of Malaysia are similar to the PDPA of Singapore and applies to any data processed in Malaysia. PowerSchool is not subject to GDPR, yet PowerSchool is identifying and analyzing the feasibility of complying with the privacy laws in Southeast Asia as a good governance measure.

Post-Brexit, the GDPR, 2018 is not applicable to UK.  Instead, the data privacy law in UK, the Data Protection Act, 2018 – which was a domestication and implementation of the GDPR when the UK was still part of the EU, controls how businesses process personal data. It imposes the duty on every person using personal data to comply with the seven ‘data protection principles’. The Act provides the UK citizens numerous rights over their data as used by government, businesses, and private organizations.   Through our agreements with our customers and our internal processes, PowerSchool complies with this Act as a data processor to our customers who engage directly with data subjects. or are impacted by our customers’ use of our services.
