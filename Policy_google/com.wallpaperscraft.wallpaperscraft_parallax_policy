A brief summary of the Policy:
1. We collect Users' data. This data can be personal or non-personal
2. All User’s data is collected directly from Users (when the User contacts Our support
      center), or collected automatically (User device data, identification and data about User actions in Service).
3. All data is collected on a legal basis. We use such basis as contract obligations,
      legitimate interest, or User consent (such consent can be withdrawn at any moment).
4. The collected data is used for Service maintenance. Sometimes we share that data with Third
      parties (for analytics or ads). All purposes of data processing are stated in the full Policy text (below).
5. If We need to share Users' personal data with Third parties for new purposes that were not
      stated in previous User consent, We will collect a new User consent with new purposes, and only after that will We
      share that data.
6. All data is stored for a minimal amount of time, which is enough for Us to maintain Service
      and execute all Operators' obligations.

1. Terms and definitions
Personal data
- any data about User, that identifies or allows to identify User as a person, either
      directly or indirectly. When connected to an individual, information such as their name, last name, contact
      number, and email address can be classified as personal data.
User
- a person who has achieved the necessary age for using the App legally and for giving consent to his
      personal data processing by himself, according to age restriction rules and applicable laws.
Service
- a combination of the App, databases, and other technical elements that provide Users with access
      to content.
App
- Live Wallpapers mobile application, acquired from the official store, which provides Users with
      access to the Wallcraft Service.
Data processing
- a series of actions, either simple or complex, that encompass the collection, analysis,
      sharing, storage, anonymization, and deletion of data. In the Policy we use the “processing” term for automatic
      processing only because the Operator does not process personal data in any other way.
Operator
- a person or company that processes Users’ personal data on a legal basis.
Anonymized data
- information that has been irreversibly altered to remove any direct or indirect links to
      a specific individual. This results in a dataset that undeniably belongs to a certain user, yet eliminates the
      possibility of identifying exactly who that user is.
Sensitive data
- a special category of data relating to information on the racial and ethnic origin of the
      User, his political preferences, attitudes towards religion and other beliefs, membership information in societies
      and trade unions, sexual orientation, biometric and genetic information, health, and other "sensitive" data.
Third parties
- persons or companies that are not affiliated with Us or controlled by Us.
2. What personal data are we collect
While providing Users with access to our Service, We collect certain data about Our Users. That data could be
      used for User identification. All collected data divided according to the way of collecting on:
• Data shared by User
While using the Service User can contact Us for some reason: contact support, fill a claim, enquire terms and
      rules, etc. We access all data that User has provided to Us in that appeal. That data can contain name, email,
      phone number, contact information, photo, User ID etc.
• Data which was collected automatically
While accessing the Service User device, it automatically transmits to Us certain data because this data is
      necessary for Service maintenance, advertisement system maintenance, and effectiveness analysis. The list of
      automatically collectable data is wide and can include (but not limited to): name and version of OS, IP, device
      IDs, bundle ID, App version, device information (type, screen resolution, model, brand, etc.), advertisement IDs,
      data about other apps on the device, device language, time and date, device geolocation (approximate), User in-app
      activity records and data, User pseudoID, and other data.
All assignable identifiers are stored on the User device, so if the User removes the App, all identifiers are
      reset. If the User downloads the App again, he will be assigned new identifiers.
3. How do We use User data
Any data processing and use is based on a legal basis only. The Legal basis for data processing can be:
• Personal data processing for executing contract obligations. Contract obligations can be a
      legal basis, for example:
Processing for Service maintenance, for technical support, for App updating, for consideration of complaints and
      appeals, for Market rules compliance, for selection of device-compatible content, localisation setting, etc.
• Processing of Personal data is necessary to fulfill legitimate interests that do not infringe
      upon the rights and freedoms of Users. This processing cannot be done without using the minimum amount of
      necessary data. Legitimate interests may include, but are not limited to, the following purposes:
Processing of user data for security purposes, analytics of the Service's performance, studying User behavior,
      identifying opportunities for Service improvement, analyzing advertising effectiveness, tracking content trends,
      collecting publication statistics, and conducting marketing research.
• Processing of Personal data by Users is carried out solely on the basis of their voluntary
      and informed consent. This consent may at any time be altered, withdrawn, or not given at all. However, it is
      important to note that the lack of consent for data processing will not hinder the User's access to the Service.
      It will only limit the User's ability to receive personalized advertising offers and content collections based on
      their data. The list of processing purposes for which User consent is required may include, but is not limited
      to:
Processing for the purpose of providing personalized content, provision of personalized advertising, provision of
      advertisements on the basis of the territorial location of the User, provision of advertisements in the language
      of the User, analytics of Users interaction with advertisements, creation of a personalized User’s advertising
      profile, and analysis of Users activity in the web for advertising purposes.
4. How do we share Users data to third parties
In cases expressly provided for in the Policy, we may transfer the personal data of Users to third parties. Such
      third parties may be (but are not limited to):
• Our affiliates;
• Service providers performing certain activities on our behalf;
• Our successors in case of liquidation or reorganization of the company;
• State and other bodies requesting data from Users on a legal basis;
Also, we may transfer non-personal User data (which does not contain information that can identify the User
      as a specific person) to third-party companies for the purposes of advertising, analyzing, and improving the
      quality of the Service. In such transfers, reasonable safety requirements are required from third-party
      recipients. We do not share Personal data and non-personal data received from Users at the same time.
5. Security measures
When processing a User’s Personal data, We comply with all reasonable security requirements that can prevent
      loss, leakage, theft, unauthorized access, and other illegal actions. However, it is important to note that no
      system can provide a 100% guarantee of data safety on the network. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that all
      third parties who receive User data from us or through their own privacy policies will comply with the necessary
      security measures.
6. User data storage
When processing Users' Personal data, we strive to keep it to a minimum and for the shortest amount of time
      necessary. We will delete all User data as soon as it is no longer needed for the purposes outlined in the Policy
      or upon receiving a request from the User to delete his personal data. If a User chooses to use the Service again,
      any previously deleted data will be replaced with new data.
In certain cases, we may retain User Personal data for
      a longer period than necessary to fulfill our Service obligations in connection with the consideration of User
      communications or complaints, legal disputes, and other important matters.
In this case, the information is
      processed only for declared purposes that prevent its deletion. As soon as the reasons for preventing deletion
      cease, we will delete such information about the User as soon as possible.
7. Processing of children's Personal data
We knowingly do not process the Personal Data from anyone under 13 years of age (or the age required by
      applicable law for us to obtain consent from each User for processing their Personal Data). In accordance with the
      User Agreement and the age limit of the Service, we consider each User of the Service an individual who has
      reached the minimum age required to give consent to Personal Data processing in accordance with applicable
      legislation. In the event that we become aware that the person using the Service has not reached the age required
      by applicable law, we will promptly delete all Personal Data that we have processed during the period when we were
      unaware of the User’s age.
8. Policy changes
Periodically, We may make changes to the Policy on the basis of a unilateral decision. You can learn about such
      changes from a notice about the date of the last change at the beginning of the Policy or from a notice in the
      App.
In case the User does not agree with the current Policy in its entirety or in part, or does not agree with the
      updates in its entirety or in part, such User should stop using the Service and delete the Application, and
      refrain from using the Service in the future until the terms of the Policy and User Agreement are acceptable to
      such User.
9. Cross Border data transfer
We may transfer Personal data of our Users across borders. Such a transfer shall be subject to all legal
      requirements and restrictions that guarantee an adequate level of protection of User’s Personal data. All the data
      we have gathered and shared with outside parties is automatically gathered and does not, by itself, facilitate the
      User's identity. Information about the User that we obtain from third parties shall be transmitted in compliance
      with all necessary security requirements, which shall be established by the rules for processing the personal data
      of each such third party. The information provided by the Users themselves shall not be transmitted across borders
      to any third parties.
