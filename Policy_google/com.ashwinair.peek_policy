1. Information We Collect
- Device Information: We may collect basic device details (e.g., device type, OS version, unique device identifiers) to improve app performance and troubleshoot issues.
- Usage Data: We use analytics tools (e.g., Firebase Analytics) to collect anonymized data about how you interact with Peek, such as pages viewed and session duration, to enhance your experience.
- No Personal Data: Peek does not collect personally identifiable information like your name, email, or precise location unless you explicitly provide it (e.g., via feedback).

2. How We Use Your Information
- App Functionality: To deliver content from Wikipedia and ensure Peek runs smoothly.
- Analytics: To understand usage trends and improve features—no individual tracking.

4. Data Storage and Security

- We use reasonable measures to protect data but cannot guarantee absolute security due to internet nature.
