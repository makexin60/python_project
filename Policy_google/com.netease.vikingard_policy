REGIONAL INFORMATION
Additional Information for U.S. Residents
This section supplements the information above and further describes how we collect, use, and disclose personal information we collect about U.S. consumers who use our Services.
Our Collection & Use of Personal Information.
As detailed above, we collect personal information for a range of different purposes, but the main reason we collect information is to provide and operate the Services. We collect the following categories of personal information:
Identifiers
(contact information and unique personal identifiers, including username, email address, IP address, device identifiers, and other similar identifiers);
Personal information as defined in California's customer records law
(such as contact information and – if you choose to provide it – physical characteristics or description);
Characteristics of protected classifications
in the form of demographic information (date of birth / gender), if you choose to provide them;
Commercial information
(purchase or consuming histories, tendencies, or preferences);
Internet or electronic network activity
(information related to app, game, or website usage);
Approximate geolocation data
(country / region);
Audio, electronic, visual, or similar information
(such as profile photo, user-generated content, or voice chat);
Other "personal information" as defined under applicable law
(such as your credit or debit card information);
Inferences drawn from any of these categories
(for example, your city / country / region based on IP address); and
Sensitive personal information
relating to account log-in combined with access credentials.
The section "How We Use Personal Information
" describes the business and commercial purposes for collecting your personal information. The section "How We Share Personal Information
" describes the third parties with whom we share personal information and for what purposes.
Your Rights.
In addition to the privacy rights described in "Exercising Your Rights
" above, you may have the following rights:
Right to Opt Out of Sale:
You have the right to know whether we sell your data and to opt out of such sale if we do. We do not sell the personal information of our users.
Right to Opt Out of Sharing for Behavioral Advertising:
You have the right to opt out of the sharing of your personal information for purposes of behavioral advertising. You may opt out of this sharing by navigating to "
Account Center
" → "
Ad Settings
", adjusting your cookie preferences, or contacting us via in-app customer service or email at
vikingard.cs@gmail.com
.
Authorized Agents:
Designate, in writing or through a power of attorney document, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf.
Certain browser plug-ins provide options for communicating opt-out preference signals, such as the Global Privacy Control ("
GPC
"). We treat GPC signals as a request to opt-out of targeted advertising or the "sharing" of personal information in relation to your browser or device that sends the GPC signal. If you are not logged into your account, the request through the GPC signal will not extend to any account information, as the connection between your browser or device and account is not known to us.
We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
We do not knowingly "sell" or "share" personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
Removal of Publicly-Posted Content.
If you are a resident of California and a registered user of the Services, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Services when you were under the age of 18 by emailing us at
vikingard.cs@gmail.com
or by contacting in-game customer service. Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.
Notice of Financial Incentive / Bona Fide Loyalty Program.
We offer users the opportunity to obtain nominal in-game currency and other rewards ("
Rewards
"), which may provide benefits to those who choose to participate ("
Members
"). Rewards may be considered a "financial incentive" or a "Bona Fide Loyalty Program" under California and Colorado state law.
Our collection of Members' personal information (including name, email address, and phone number) allows us to provide the Rewards. We use Members' personal information both to award, and to enable Members to redeem, benefits. The amount of personal information that we collect from a Member or non-Member may vary and is dependent on the level of interactions and engagement that the Member or non-Member has with us, including the Rewards in which the Member chooses to participate.
We use personal information collected in connection with the Rewards program for marketing and other purposes described above. The types of personal information that we collect from Members who participate in Rewards are generally similar to the types of Personal Information that we collect from consumers who do not participate in Rewards. We do not collect sensitive personal information in connection with Rewards.
Solely for purposes of California privacy law, we estimate the value of a Member's personal information to be reasonably related to the value of the benefits that Members obtain through participating in Rewards. We have based this good faith estimate on the value that arises from increased customer interactions, the costs, and expenses we incur in offering Rewards, the types of Rewards provided, and the collection and retention of the personal information of consumers who have voluntarily chosen to participate in Rewards. The value of Rewards to Members varies significantly, as individual Members take advantage of Rewards to varying degrees.
Members who are California or Colorado consumers may exercise their privacy rights and may choose not to receive marketing communications or offers at any time without any effect on their eligibility to participate in Rewards. A Member may revoke their consent to participate in Rewards at any time by emailing us at
vikingard.cs@gmail.com
or by contacting in-game customer service.

Privacy for Younger Players
Posted:
November

, 2024
WHY AM I SEEING THIS?
This page provides information to our younger players about ORIENJOY Games collects, uses, and shares data about users of our services. We are providing this content so that you can easily understand what kinds of personal information we collect, how we use it, and what happens to your personal information.
If you want to know more details about the personal information that ORIENJOY Games collects and uses, please ask a responsible adult to help you read our entire
Privacy Policy.
WHO IS ORIENJOY GAMES?
ORIENJOY Games is a publisher of games, apps, websites, and other digital services used by players around the world.
WHAT IS "PERSONAL INFORMATION"?
Personal information is anything that can be used to identify a person or that relates directly to a person. It's also sometimes called "personal data." Some examples of personal information that ORIENJOY Games collects are things you may already be familiar with, like username, avatar, email address, and birthday. Personal information can also refer to data that is collected automatically, like the actions that a player takes inside of a game, messages they share, or technical information about the device or computer they are using.
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We use it to provide our Services and to give our players fun, safe, and unique user experiences. For example, we use personal information to keep track of a player's progress within a game, help players connect with each other, send updates about our games, complete player purchases, and enforce our community rules. We also use it for things like helping us understand who our players are and how we can improve our services.
Sometimes, we need to share personal information with other companies in the ORIENJOY group or with other people in order to operate our services or to make sure we are following legal requirements. For players who are under a certain age, we need to get permission from their parent or guardian before enabling some services or features.
Our full Privacy Policy describes the different ways we use and share personal information.
HOW CAN I CONTROL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We provide different options to adjust privacy settings depending on the specific game, app, website, or service you are using. A responsible adult can help you with these.
Depending on where you live, you also may have legal rights over how companies like us manage your personal information. For example, you can ask us for a copy of the personal information we collected about you, ask us to delete your personal information, or ask us to make changes to incorrect information.
HOW CAN I STAY SAFE AROUND OTHER PLAYERS?
Review your privacy settings to limit who can see your content or contact you in the game or app. When sharing information that might be seen by other players (like in a chat or on a profile page), don't share your real name, location, email address, or any other information that could help someone find you outside of the game or app. Don't send anyone pictures of you. Tell a responsible adult if anything or anyone makes you feel uncomfortable online, and use in-game reporting features to report harassing or harmful behavior.
