Information Collection And Use
When using our mobile apps, our systems and/or service providers will record your IP address, platform, date and time of your usage, and transactional information.  Our mobile apps, depending on your usage of features they offer, may also find accounts on your device; provide your approximate location (network-based) and/or precise location (GPS and network-based); read, modify, and/or delete contents of your device’s storage; receive data from the Internet; broadcast data messages; view and access any network connections; control sound and/or vibration of your device; prevent your device from sleeping; and read your Google service configuration.
Central Service Association uses this information for the following general purposes: to provide features and functionality, to improve our products and services, to evaluate and optimize network traffic patterns, to plan adjustments to our technology, and to provide anonymous reporting for tracking usage of our mobile apps and related services.  Our Internet service providers may use the information to make certain their servers are performing optimally.
Information Sharing And Disclosure
Central Service Association does not rent, sell, or share PII about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or when provided to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Central Service Association under confidentiality agreements.  These companies may use your PII to help Central Service Association communicate with you about our services and products.  However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We may disclose PII in response to legal process; for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.  We also may disclose PII where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of contract; to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our services and applicable laws; or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.
Confidentiality And Security
We have taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure, and in its original form where possible.  As such, access to all PII is strictly controlled.  We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect.

You are responsible for keeping your access credentials confidential, including your password.  You should notify us immediately if your password is hacked or stolen.  Central Service Association is not responsible or liable to you in any way if information is intercepted by an unauthorized person, either in transit or at your home, business, or other place of access.
