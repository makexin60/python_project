Microphone Usage
Memozy uses your device's microphone solely for speech-to-text functionality, enabling seamless
                interaction through voice commands. Here’s what you need to know:
When is the Microphone Used?
The microphone is activated only when you explicitly press
                the microphone button in the app. Memozy will always request your permission before accessing the
                microphone, and this can be revoked at any time via your device settings.
Automatic Deactivation:
The microphone automatically turns off when:
You finish speaking.
You manually stop the input.
The speech-to-text conversion is complete.
How is Audio Data Handled?
All audio input is processed in real time and converted to
                text. Memozy does not store or retain any audio data on its servers. Data transmissions are encrypted,
                and audio input is used exclusively for real-time processing.
Notifications
Memozy uses your device's notification system strictly to send reminders that you set within the app. No
                additional notifications are sent, and Memozy does not use notifications for tracking or advertising
                purposes. Notifications can be managed or disabled entirely through your device settings.
Calendar Access
Memozy integrates with your device's calendar to help you manage meetings and events. Calendar access is
                used solely for the purpose of:
Adding meetings and events that you create through Memozy.
Updating existing calendar entries upon your request.
Memozy does not track your calendar activity or share your calendar data with any third parties. You can
                revoke calendar access at any time through your device settings.
Your Data, Your Control
Memozy prioritizes your data privacy and provides you with full control over your information:
We do not track user activity or collect unnecessary data.
All your conversations, notes, and entries are securely stored.
You can delete all your personal data, including past conversations and entries, with just one click
                    from the settings page.
Your Rights and Consent
Memozy ensures that you have complete control over all permissions and features:
Permissions are requested explicitly and only when required for specific functionality.
You can revoke permissions (microphone, calendar, notifications) at any time through your device
                    settings.
Memozy will never access these features in the background or without your direct interaction.
Transparency and Security
Memozy employs robust encryption and strict security protocols to ensure your data remains private and
                secure. We do not share your personal data with third parties or use it for advertising purposes.
