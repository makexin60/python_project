The game Dungeons of Dreadrock does not collect or store any user-data except for Unity's Handling of Unity Ads, Unity In-App-Purchasea and Unity Analytics.
		Those three user-data interfaces are controlled and handled by Unity as described here:

		Unless you purchase the full version (via the ingame menu) monetization will be handled via ads.
		For these ads Unity might use (cf. link above) personal information.
		If you want to opt out of personally identifiable information collection, you can do so via the game's menu.
