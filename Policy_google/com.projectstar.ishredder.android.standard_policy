Introduction
At Protectstar Inc. (“Protectstar”, “we”, “us”, “our”), safeguarding your privacy is at the core of our mission. Our primary goal is to protect users ("you", "your") from unauthorized access, theft, disruption, and other security threats in the digital world. This Privacy Policy reflects our dedication to maintaining transparency and trust by detailing the ways we collect, use, and protect the personal information you provide through our Android apps and services.
We recognize that privacy is a fundamental right and a key component of security. In support of this belief, this Privacy Policy outlines the following:
Data Collection
: What types of information we collect and why it is necessary for delivering our services.
Data Use
: How we use your data to provide and enhance our products while ensuring your security.
Your Rights and Choices
: The options available to you for controlling the use of your personal data, including the right to access, correct, or delete it.
Contacting Us
: How you can reach out to us with questions, concerns, or requests regarding your data privacy.
This Privacy Policy applies whenever you interact with our products or services, whether you are downloading or installing our apps, or using them on your devices. By using our services, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (EULA). We encourage you to review these terms regularly as they govern your rights and responsibilities while using our services.
As Protectstar continues to innovate and grow, we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our business operations or legal obligations. In the event of significant changes, we will notify you through email, in-product notifications, or as otherwise required by law. Please check this page periodically to stay informed of any updates.
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of Protectstar’s products and services worldwide. For users located in specific regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), additional rights and protections may apply, as detailed in this document.
At Protectstar, we are driven by a strong commitment to privacy and security, values that are central to our mission of protecting your personal information in the digital world.
Which Protectstar Android Apps Do Collect Personal Data?
Protectstar only collects necessary data to ensure the proper functionality of our services. The following apps may collect personal data:
Anti Spy Android
Antivirus AI Android
Camera Guard Android
DNS Changer Android
Firewall AI Android
Micro Guard Android
iShredder Android (only when using a MY.PROTECTSTAR online account)
Types of Data We Collect
We collect two main types of data to improve our services and ensure your device's security:
Installed Application Information
: We collect the names of apps installed on your device to monitor and provide security protection. We do not collect content from these apps—only their names.
SHA-256 & MD5 Checksums
: We collect checksums (digital fingerprints) for installed apps and files to verify their integrity and detect unauthorized changes. These checksums allow us to detect potential security threats without accessing the actual content of files or apps.
Data Collection: Why, What, and How
We collect certain information to enhance your security and optimize the functionality of our apps. Here's why specific types of data are collected:
I. Why We Collect Your Data
We collect certain information to improve your security and enhance the functionality of our services. Here's why we need specific types of data:
App Package Name (Users’ installed application information):
We collect the names of the apps installed on your device. This information helps us customize our security features to protect the apps you use from potential threats like malware or spyware. For example, if you have apps that are more likely to be targeted by harmful software, our systems can prioritize protecting them, ensuring you stay safe. Importantly, we
do not access or collect any content from within the apps
—only the names of the apps themselves are collected for security purposes.
SHA-256 & MD5 Checksums (App Integrity):
A checksum is like a digital fingerprint of a file or app. It’s a way of creating a unique code from the contents of a file or app, which allows us to check if that file or app has been altered in any way.
File Checksums (File Integrity):
Like apps, we collect checksums for files on your device to detect unauthorized changes. This ensures that your files remain safe and intact, without us ever accessing the content of those files.
When we collect checksums, we are
not sending the entire app or file to our servers
. Instead, we generate a code (the checksum) from the file or app. This code is unique to that version of the file, so if a file has been changed (for example, by malware), the checksum will be different. By comparing the checksum from your device with the expected checksum, we can quickly detect if something is wrong without needing access to the actual file or app content.
MD5 and SHA-256
are just two different types of these digital fingerprints. While MD5 is an older method, SHA-256 is more advanced and secure. We use these checksums to ensure that your apps haven’t been tampered with, helping to protect you from potential security risks like malware or spyware.
The clarification that
no
complete apps or files are sent to the server is helpful and reassuring. However, it could be emphasized even more to prevent any misunderstandings among users. By reiterating this point, we can ensure that users fully understand that
only checksums
, which are like digital fingerprints, are transmitted, and
not
the actual content of their apps or files.
This process ensures your files are safe from potential threats while fully preserving your privacy.
The purpose of sending the collected data (app package names and SHA-256/MD5 checksums) to our
Protectstar AI Cloud
servers to https://api.protectstar.com is to perform a deeper analysis. By using cloud servers instead of local device processing, we can provide efficient, precise analysis without overloading your device’s resources.
The data we collect serves essential purposes, such as:
Detecting and mitigating potential security threats like malware or spyware.
Assessing the safety of apps and files installed on your device.
Reducing false alarms by accurately distinguishing between safe and harmful software.
Continuously improving app performance and capabilities through real-time analysis.
II. What We Collect
We collect two primary types of data to protect your device:
Installed Application Information:
This includes the names of apps installed on your device, allowing us to monitor their security and provide targeted protection. As mentioned earlier, we do not access the content within these apps.
File and App Checksums (SHA-256/MD5):
These checksums, which we previously explained as a type of digital fingerprint, are used to verify the integrity of apps and files on your device. By comparing these checksums, we can detect if any unauthorized changes have been made, ensuring the security of your apps and files.
III. How We Use Your Data
At Protectstar, we use the information we collect responsibly to enhance your security, improve the functionality of our apps, and provide high-quality support.
Here’s how your data is used:
Security Analysis:
We analyze app package names and checksums to detect malware and other potential threats.
Threat Detection:
By comparing checksums, we can identify unauthorized changes to apps or files, ensuring your device's security.
Performance Optimization:
We offload resource-intensive analysis to our secure cloud servers, enhancing your device's efficiency without compromising performance.
All data is
securely transmitted
to our cloud servers to
https://api.protectstar.com
using
AES-256 encryption over HTTPS
, ensuring your information remains confidential. Your data is anonymized during processing, so it cannot be linked back to you as an individual.
If you prefer not to have this data collected, you can disable your internet connection, but please note that this may affect the app's ability to detect malware and provide real-time protection.
Purpose of Data Collection
We collect and process your data to:
Enhance the security of your device by identifying potential malware or spyware.
Perform threat analysis and maintain the integrity of apps and files on your device.
Optimize app performance by using cloud servers for resource-intensive tasks.
Reduce false alarms and continuously improve app functionality.
By processing this data on our cloud servers, we protect your device without compromising its performance.
How We Handle Your Data
Anonymity
: We prioritize your privacy and ensure all data transmitted to our cloud server at
https://api.protectstar.com/api/get-deep-detective-packages-shas-info
(only Antivirus AI and Anti Spy app) and https://api.protectstar.com/api/get-blocklists-info (only Firewall AI) is completely anonymized.
Encryption
: We employ stringent data transmission practices, including the use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a
256-bit
key, carried over the
HTTPS
protocol. This robust encryption not only secures your data but also reinforces the impossibility of tracing the data back to individual users.
Opting Out of Data Collection:
If you prefer
not
to have your data collected, you may
turn off your internet connection
, which could lead to decreased detection of possible malware and other security threats.
Data Collection and Usage by Specific Apps
Overview about all our apps and their specific data collectection practices that is send to the related URL incl. their purpose as well as the Restricted Permissions.
Through transparently explaining these functions, we aim to instill confidence in our users regarding the privacy and integrity of their data when utilizing our applications:
1) Firewall AI & DNS Changer
Note about both apps:
The
Firewall AI
and DNS Changer app forwards the traffic of allowed connections directly to their destination through the Android VPN Service without using a remote VPN server.
Its mode of operation can lead to one of two scenarios concerning your internet traffic:
When IP Filtering is Disabled:
Any blocked internet traffic is routed into the local VPN service, effectively acting as a sinkhole that drops all blocked traffic.
When IP Filtering is Enabled:
Both blocked and allowed internet traffic are routed into the local VPN service, but only allowed traffic is forwarded to the intended destination. No traffic is sent to a remote VPN server.
The
Android VPN Service
(https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService.html) is utilized to locally route all internet traffic to Firewall AI. This design means that root access is not required to build or implement this firewall application.

No personal data or activity tracking occurs
, so we do
not collect
personal or sensitive user data through
Firebase Messaging
.
No other Firebase services, such as Firebase Crashlytics, are used for collecting crash reports or personal data.
Learn more about Firebase Messaging’s data handling at
https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/play-data-disclosure?hl=de#cloud-messaging
Rest assured, Firebase Messaging is only used to ensure you receive relevant messages and updates, and no personal or sensitive data is shared with or collected by third parties. For this, Firebase Messaging is specifically setup to collect
no analytics data
according to their documentation.
What we aren't going to process
Protectstar
never processes "sensitive" personal data
such as religion, political views, sexual preference, health, or other special categories of personal data through its products and services. Therefore, we do not wish to receive any such data and will not request it from you.
Protectstar's products must be installed and used by an adult. Children may use the device where Protectstar's product was installed only with permission from their parents or holder of parental responsibility. Except for the "Data for child protection feature," we do not intend to process personal data of children, nor do we want to receive such personal information of children.
Data Sharing and SDKs
We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties. The information we collect, such as
hash values
(e.g., SHA-256 and MD5 checksums), is
fully anonymized
and is used solely to enhance the functionality of our apps and protect your device.
When you use our apps, we may collect data like app checksums or file metadata. These checksums are unique digital fingerprints that allow us to verify the integrity of apps and files on your device without accessing their actual content. Importantly, this data does not contain any personal information, and it is anonymized to ensure it cannot be traced back to you.
Data retention is minimal:
The data we collect is processed on secure servers located in Germany and is deleted after just a few seconds once the analysis is complete. This ensures that your data is handled securely and only for the duration necessary to fulfill its purpose.
At present, none of our apps integrate third-party SDKs that collect or share personal or sensitive user data. Should we decide to integrate any third-party SDKs in the future, we will ensure full compliance with Google Play’s policies and update this Privacy Policy accordingly. We will also request your explicit consent before any such data collection or integration occurs.
Prominent Disclosure and User Consent
Before we collect any personal or sensitive data, you will see a clear in-app disclosure explaining:
