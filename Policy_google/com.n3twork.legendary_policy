Information we may collect through Third Parties
If you play or access the Products on connected third party applications or connect our Products to any third party applications, including social networks, we may receive certain information about you from the provider of the third party application. The information we receive depends on the third party application, your privacy settings and, if applicable, your friends’ privacy settings on that third party application. If you access the Products from a third-party application or connect the Products to a third-party application, you should also read that third-party application’s terms of service and privacy policy. If you are unclear about what information a third party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their privacy practices.
PerBlue may collect information about you from third-party sources to supplement information provided by you. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided us and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products, and services.

Do Not Track
When using PerBlue’s online services, PerBlue may collect personal information about individual users’ online activities over time and across different web sites or online services operated by PerBlue. To use PerBlue’s online services, individual users are connected to their specific accounts and, therefore, PerBlue does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. PerBlue shares advertising identifiers with third-party advertising partners and may allow third-party advertising partners displaying advertisements on PerBlue’s websites and other online platforms to collect personal information about individual users’ online activities over time and across different web sites or online services.
International Users
Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights with respect to the personal data we hold about them. Such residents may request that we:
provide access to personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form)
rectify such data
delete certain personal data
object to our uses or disclosures of personal data or exercise legal rights to withdraw consent
Such requests will be processed in line with local laws, including without undue delay and in accordance with any required time frames. Although PerBlue makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which PerBlue is unable to provide access, including, but not limited to,: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If PerBlue determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will endeavor to provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made within any required time frames (approximately one month), a contact point for any further inquiries and any other legally required information. To protect your privacy, PerBlue will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.
To exercise any of the above rights (or any other rights under applicable law), please email us at legal@perblue.com.
In addition to the rights above, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concerns.

Your Rights and Choices – CCPA Rights Disclosure
If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:
