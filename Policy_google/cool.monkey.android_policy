Please note that with respect to any information which you choose to share directly with third parties, whether or not you have initially come across such third party through our Platform or our Service, such information shall not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy and shall instead be governed by the privacy policy of such third party, if any.

Please note that the information you are providing is going to a third party, and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy provided by that third party.
Cross-Border Data Transfers

Transference of Services
If Monkey or its assets are acquired, member information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
Children's Privacy
Monkey does not direct the Platform or its Service at children under 18 years of age, and the Platform and the Service are not intended to be viewed or used by them. To protect children and keep you safe on Monkey, we do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on Monkey, and will ask you to provide your age when signing up for Monkey. We may also partner with the third party to verify your age. The information provided in each age verification option is used to confirm your age, and will not be displayed on your profile. If you upload a selfie to verify your age, we and our partner will delete it once your age is confirmed. Your selfie is not used for anything else other than to verify your age. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on Monkey. Pursuant to the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (‚ÄúCOPPA‚Äù) in the United States, Monkey will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18 without first obtaining parental consent, and to the extent such information is inadvertently collected, Monkey will make every commercially reasonable effort to permanently delete the information once it has actual knowledge of such collection.
Government Requests for Information
We may notify affected users of any emergency government or law enforcement requests for their account information, however, we are not required to do so and may, in fact, be precluded from doing so by applicable law. Furthermore, we may disclose account information to a government agency or to law enforcement in response to a valid emergency disclosure request. In connection with any such request, we will require that any such law enforcement or government agency comply with basic principles of free expression, clearly state the legal reason for ascertaining the requested information, and respect the security and infrastructure of the Platform and the Service by not building any security kinks into our backend. Monkey will evaluate all emergency disclosure requests on a case-by-case basis in compliance with relevant law. Furthermore, if Monkey receives information that provides us with a good faith belief that there is an exigent emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, we may provide information necessary to prevent that harm, if we have it. We may not comply with requests for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a request that fails to identify a Monkey account or a request that is overly broad, in which case we may seek to narrow that request. Monkey will comply with all applicable laws regarding any government or emergency request for information.
Email Contact
Accepting our privacy policy, you give the express consent to Monkey to
contact
you and/or send to you commercial communications by any means, including electronic communications, to inform about our products, services, offers, or any commercial content related to us or our products or services which, at Monkey's discretion, may be interesting to you.

Account Information Access and Deletion
Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and update the personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests we‚Äôll accommodate.

If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information that we may have, you can put in a request here.

You can also remove our service from your mobile device or process account deletion. Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options, but this may result in certain services to lose full functionality. Account Deletion. You can remove your data anytime you want. Account deletion can be accessed within the app. Upon your request, we will temporarily disable your account to prepare for removal. During this time you can cancel your deletion request and we will resume your account. Upon the end of 30 days, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers. Please note, some information may remain in archived/backup copies for legal purposes or required by law (for instance, some ‚Äútraffic data‚Äù may be kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations).
Data Access and Removal

If you ask us to delete your account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers, subject to any applicable legal or other requirement to maintain certain records of your personally identifiable data.Please note that the deletion of your personally identifiable data from our database may result in us not being able to provide you with the Service.
