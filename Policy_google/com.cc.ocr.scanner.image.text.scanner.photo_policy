To enhance user experience and app functionality, we do use third-party services that may collect information as described below:

We use Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with our apps. Firebase Analytics may collect data such as your interactions within the app, app usage statistics, and device information. This data helps us improve app features, user experience, and overall service performance.
Advertising
Our apps display ads through AdMob. AdMob may collect and use information about your device and your interaction with ads to personalize the advertising content. Information collected may include device identifiers, app usage data, and information about the ads viewed or clicked within our apps.
2. Sharing Your Information
We never share the information you put in our app to anyone else. To help our app work better, we might show you ads that are picked just for you. Right now, we work with Google to show these ads. Google might need to collect some personal details like your online IDs and IP address for ads, checking how the ads are doing, and keeping things safe from fraud. But, Google will ask you first before collecting this info. Also, Google promises not to share your info or use it for anything else.
You can choose not to receive personalized ads. However, after doing so, you will still see ads, but the relevance of the ads to your interests and preferences will be reduced. To learn more about “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services”, please visit this page:
