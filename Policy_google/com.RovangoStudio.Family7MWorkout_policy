Privacy Policy

Rovango Studio I/S builds commercial apps and games. These services are provided by Rovango Studio I/S and are intended for use as is.
Respecting our players' privacy is seriously important to us.
In "Sommad: Impossible Spaces", we are using user profile for a leaderboard, where player can compare their game scores. We are displaying the user ids in the leaderboard.
Besides leaderboards, Rovango Studio does not directly collect any data from our apps and games. Instead, we rely on data provided to us by the platforms that our games are available on. The privacy policies for those platforms can be found here below.

Support Requests
When you give us information
If you ask us for support, we may ask for your username (on whatever platform you purchased the game on), but we only use that information for that specific support request.
Communicating with you
If you provide us with your email address, we'll use it exclusively for the reason you provided it to us (direct support requests). We do not use your email address (or any of your data) for marketing to you.
Additional information
Children under the age of 16
We never knowingly collect personal information from any person under the age of 16.
Removing your data
Because we do not collect data from our games, we are not able to remove that data by request (since we have no method of linking your data back to your device or platform account). Consult the privacy policy for the platform or service you purchased our game from.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
