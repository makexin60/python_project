FAQs about Privacy Policies & our Privacy Policy Generator
What is a privacy policy?
A privacy policy is a legal document where you disclose what data you collect from users, how you manage the collected data and how you use that data. The important objective of a privacy policy is to inform users how you collect, use and manage the collected.
Is the privacy policy generator free to use?
The Privacy Policy Generator (privacypolicygenerator.info) is a free generator of privacy policies for websites, apps & Facebook pages/app. You can use our free generator to create the privacy policy for your business.
Why is a privacy policy important?
The most important thing to remember is that a privacy policy is required by law if you collect data from users, either directly or indirectly. For example, if you have a contact form on your website you need a privacy policy. But you will also need a privacy policy if you use analytics tools such as Google Analytics.
Where do I put my privacy policy?
Usually, you can find privacy policies in the footer of a website. We recommend that you place your privacy policy in easy to find locations on your website.
What should the privacy policy include?
A standard privacy policy should include: what data you collect from visitors, how you collect it, why you are collecting the data, how you are using the data.
Can I copy someone else's privacy policy?
We do not recommend copying someone else's privacy policy. First of all, privacy policies are copyright-protected legal documents. But most importantly, a privacy policy must be generated based on the exact data you collect. Our privacy policy generator can help you with this.
