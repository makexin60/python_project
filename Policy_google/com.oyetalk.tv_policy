Our webpages include electronic images (known as a "pixel GIF"
                  or a "beacon") that allow the website to calculate the number
                  of webpage users or users that have saved a certain cookie.
                  The ways in which the OyeTalk community uses beacons include:
                  Beacons used within the OyeTalk community
The OyeTalk community uses beacons on the website to
                      calculate the total number of users and to identify
                      registered users using saved OyeTalk community cookies.
We are able to provide customized webpage services when
                      you are on non-6.cn websites by saving OyeTalk community
                      cookies.
Web beacons are used outside of the OyeTalk community
                      domain
The OyeTalk community uses website beacons to collect data
                      for partner websites; relevant data is also used for
                      statistical purposes
The OyeTalk community user data recorded by website
                      beacons are compiled and made available to our partners as
                      aggregate data for reference purposes. Aggregate data
                      includes information such as user count and usage, but
                      does not include any personally identifiable data.
When the OyeTalk community places website beacons to
                      collect data for our partners, we require our partners to
                      inform users on their privacy policy page that the webpage
                      uses website beacons.
NB. This option will only be recorded in your current
                      browser and will not be recorded in your user history.
                      Therefore, to completely block the beacon, you must click
                      on the above link on all of your computers and browsers.
The OyeTalk community typically adds a beacon when sending
                  emails in HTML format (emails containing images) to count the
                  number of opened messages.
Typically, electronic images are considered to be part of the
                  webpage and, including banner ads, can all be used as beacons.
                  Therefore, beacons can be added to all advertisements placed
                  by the OyeTalk community.
The OyeTalk community tracks certain usage behavior.
                  Information collected from web beacons are used to understand
                  how customers use our products, provide more accurate reports
                  and enhance the effectiveness of our marketing.
At any time, you have the right to edit your OyeTalk community
                account information and preferences, including whether you would
                like to receive information on the latest products from the
                OyeTalk community.
Your OyeTalk community account is password protected to ensure
                  the security of your privacy and information.
Under certain conditions, the OyeTalk community uses the
                  universally accepted SSL encryption system to ensure the
                  security of information transfer.
