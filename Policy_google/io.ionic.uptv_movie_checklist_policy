Additionally, information regarding your usage of the online services may still be collected for research, analytics or internal operations purposes. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of any such opt-out options.

California Residents – Privacy Rights.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27, provides certain rights to California residents.
California residents who have provided their Personal Information to UP have the right to request disclosure of the Personal Information collected about them by UP and whether/how the UP is selling such Personal Information (and to whom). UP does not sell Personal Information. California residents who have provided their Personal Information to UP also have the right to request that UP delete their Personal Information in certain circumstances. If you make a request for UP not to share or sell your Personal Information, UP will not charge you more for the services we provide, deny you access to the services we provide, or change the quality of the services you receive.
The foregoing request may be made by completing the
request form located here

This request may be made no more than twice per calendar year. UP reserves the right not to respond to requests submitted to locations other than those specified above.
UP may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose UP to operational risks such as free trial fraud. UP may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for UP billing or records purposes and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy statement. UP takes reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify Personal Information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.

Consent to Processing and Transfer of Information.
UP is a United States company and the Site is provided from the United States. If you are a user who resides outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Site, or providing us with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable countries in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to, those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
What Else Should I Know About My Privacy?
Third-party web sites and services accessible through the Site have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. Please be careful and responsible online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information through the transmission process, and any transmission by you of information is done at your own risk.
Children.
Children under the age of 13 years may not provide any Personal Information, including name, physical and e-mail address, telephone number, or any other information that allows others to contact them physically or electronically, to us via any of our services without verifiable parental consent.  We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for use of any of our services. In the event we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete such information as quickly as possible.
Security.
We use our best efforts to protect your Personal Information and, to that end, use tools such as encryption, passwords, and physical security to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no website can be absolutely secure. Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications and other users may abuse or misuse your Personal Information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information or private communications will always remain absolutely private.
How Do We Respond to Do Not Track signals?

However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser settings. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from accessing the full features offered on the Site.
