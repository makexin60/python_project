Mobile Application
This section explains the privacy policies that apply when you use our Mobile Application (
Android
,
iOS
).
Use of Google API
This section describes how our Mobile Application utilizes and safeguards user data obtained through the Google API. We prioritize the privacy and security of your information and want to ensure transparency regarding the manner in which we access, use, store, or share your Google user data. Please read this policy carefully before using our Mobile Application.
1. Scope of Access:
Our Mobile Application requests the following scopes from the Google API: “auth/userinfo.email,” “auth/userinfo.profile,” and “openid”. These scopes enable us to retrieve specific user information required for authentication and vote casting purposes only.
2. User Authentication:
To access user data, we redirect you to a Google authentication screen where you will be prompted to log in to your Google account. This ensures a secure and reliable authentication process directly with Google. We do not collect or store your Google account login credentials.
3. Use of User Data:
We employ the user data obtained through the Google API solely for the purpose of allowing you to cast unique votes for polls. This data is never shared with third parties or used for any other purpose beyond facilitating your engagement with our polling system.
4. Storage of User Data – On User’s Phone:
Your user data, including personal information, is encrypted and stored securely on your device. We take measures to safeguard this data and prevent unauthorized access.
5. Storage of User Data – On Server:
For enhanced functionality, we encrypt and securely store your user data on our servers. Each vote you cast is associated with your encrypted user data, enabling retrieval of your votes and preventing duplicate votes for the same poll. We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or breaches.
6. Keeping it Simple:
Our approach aims to simplify the user experience by eliminating the requirement for platform-specific account creation. By leveraging the Google API and securely storing your encrypted user data, we provide a convenient and efficient means for you to participate in polls without additional login procedures.
We value your privacy and are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of your data. By using our Mobile Application, you acknowledge and consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any concerns or questions regarding the handling of your data, please contact us using the provided contact information above.
