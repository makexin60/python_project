This section applies to any California residents about whom we have collected personal information from any source, including through your use of our Website(s), products or services, or by communicating with us electronically, in paper correspondence, or in person (collectively, for purposes of this section only, “you”). This section explains how Perpay may collect, use, and disclose personal information subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act (together, the “CCPA”).

What Personal Information is Covered by the CCPA?
Under the CCPA “personal information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California consumer/resident or household.  Personal information does not include publicly available information, or lawfully obtained, truthful information that is a matter of public concern, information that has been de-identified, aggregate consumer information, or information that does not fall within the definition of personal information above.

The CCPA does not apply to certain information that is already regulated by federal or state privacy laws, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and certain other state or federal privacy laws.

As such, most of the personal information about you that we may collect and use is protected by the privacy rules of the GLBA and exempt from the CCPA. Please note that the disclosures below may pertain to information that is regulated by GLBA, FCRA, or other laws, and Perpay does not waive any applicable CCPA exemptions as to that information by including such disclosures in this Privacy Policy.
Similarly, this section does not apply to information we may collect in the context of a person’s role as a job applicant, employee, associate, contractor, or other member of Perpay’s workforce, which is subject to Perpay’s California Employment Information Privacy Statement.

Order Acceptance: Each part of any order that you submit to Perpay constitutes an offer to purchase. If you do not receive a message from Perpay confirming receipt of your order, please contact our Customer Service department at hello@perpay.com before re-entering your order. Perpay’s confirmation of receipt of your order does not constitute Perpay's acceptance of your order. Perpay is only deemed to have accepted your order once the product(s) you ordered (the “Product(s)”) have been shipped. To make an order through the Services, you must be enrolled in Perpay’s payroll direct deposit program. Order Issues: Perpay reserves the right to deny any order for any reason, including if: (i) we discover an error in pricing and/or other information about the Product or receive insufficient or erroneous payment or shipping information, (ii) we suspect or it otherwise appears an order or associated payment may be connected to fraud, (iii) the Product is unavailable due to discontinuance or otherwise, (iv) you do not meet the eligibility requirements for use of the Services, or (v) you have exceeded your spending limit (vi) you have missed payments or made late payments in the past for a Perpay order. Returns: Please refer to our Return Policy found at: https://help.perpay.com/en/articles/108745-how-do-i-return-my-item if you would like to return any Product you purchased through the Services. Please note that the return policy varies by Product and not all Products are available for return. Please consult our Shipping and Return Policy for further details. Some items may be subject to a shipping and restocking fee. Damage claims must be submitted within 24-48 business hours of delivery, please inspect your order once it has arrived. Order Cancellation: If any Product is discontinued or otherwise becomes unavailable, Perpay reserves the right to cancel your order and provide you a credit for the amount paid for the Product. Restrictions on Resale: To protect the intellectual property rights of Perpay and its licensors and suppliers, to the extent permitted by law, any resale of Products for personal and/or business profit is strictly prohibited. Perpay reserves the right to decline any order that we deem to possess characteristics of reselling. Shipping: All items are prepared for shipment after your payment(s) via payroll direct deposit has been made on your scheduled payday. Risk of loss and title to items purchased from Perpay passes to the purchaser upon our delivery to the shipper. Depending upon your Product(s), shipments may be made in multiple packages and may be delivered on different dates. You will typically receive an email with tracking numbers within 3-5 business days of your first successful payment via payroll direct deposit, with the exception of furniture, mattresses, large TV's & other large appliances. These items are delivered via freight shipping and will require delivery to be scheduled with you directly. Please be advised it will take longer to generate tracking on freight delivery items. Items shipped via freight delivery (see individual product delivery details), in addition to all Ashley Furniture products, are unavailable to ship to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico Shipping surcharges may apply, but are not limited to, small parcel orders shipping to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Customers are not authorized to alter shipper delivery instructions in any way. If altered, Perpay Parties (as defined herein) and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss, claim, liability, or damage of any kind (“Loss”). This includes, but is not limited to, UPS My Choice. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Perpay Parties and the carrier from all Loss arising from or relating to the alterations of the delivery instructions. Perpay uses a third-party service provider for fulfilling orders. By ordering any Product through the Services, you acknowledge that Perpay has no responsibility or liability for any delays that may result from orders handled by such third-party service provider. Perpay Parties and the shipment carrier shall not be liable to you for any Loss, including but not limited to direct, indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages, whether based on contract or otherwise arising out of, or resulting from, UPS's provision of, or failure to provide, shipping service, including by following consignee instructions, failure to follow consignee instructions, delivery pursuant or contrary to consignee's instructions, misdelivery, or delayed delivery. By selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, you authorize the carrier to release packages addressed to you at your address when no one is present to receive the delivery and you will be asked and are required to accept responsibility for any loss or damage to the package after it has been released at the address. In no event shall Perpay Parties or the carrier be liable for any Loss, including but not limited to those arising out of, or resulting from loss, theft, alteration of, unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, your personal information, or other security breach, compromise, or incident involving your personal information, whether by third parties or otherwise, arising out of or resulting from the release of packages pursuant to the Authorized Shipment Release. Fees and Purchase Terms
Assessment of Spending Limit: Your “Approved Spending Limit” is the total dollar amount you may use towards purchases made through the Services. Your “Available Spending Limit” is your Approved Spending Limit minus any outstanding balances you have on your Account. Perpay may provide an estimated spending limit as a guide when placing your first order. Perpay reserves the right to change your spending limits at any time for any reason, including without limitation, your past payment history with Perpay or changes to your Account information. Promise to Pay:Each time you purchase a Product, you promise that you have the current intention and, to the best of your knowledge, you have the current ability to pay the full Perpay Purchase Price for the Product in accordance with the Perpay Payment Schedule. Absent a violation of this representation, you are not legally obligated to continue making payments. Accordingly, you do not “owe” us anything and, if you lose your job, have a medical emergency, encounter other unexpected financial difficulties you may cease making payments without legal liability to us. Of course, we ask you to do your best to resume payments when you can and will not approve further Product purchases while any scheduled payment under the Perpay Payment Schedule remains past due. Additionally, if you have enrolled in Perpay Plus and we are reporting your performance to one or more credit bureaus, we may report your failure to make all scheduled payments to one or more consumer reporting agencies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that your credit report may reflect late payments or missed payments. Additional Fees: Perpay will not charge any additional fees as result of missed or late payments. ACH/Credit/Debit Card Payment Authorization: In the event that you are unable to make payments through payroll direct deposit for an existing order(s), Perpay can charge your bank account (ACH), credit card or debit card (a “backup payment method”) on your behalf to satisfy your outstanding balance for an existing order(s). Payments made through a backup payment method can be made on a one-time or automatic recurring basis. Perpay will not make one-time or recurring charges using a backup payment method on your behalf without receiving your consent. A backup payment method can only be used to satisfy an outstanding balance for an existing order(s), you will not be able to move forward with a new order(s) until you are able to resume making payments through payroll direct deposit. The Backup Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated backup payment method, and you must refer to that agreement, not this Agreement, to determine your rights and liabilities. Perpay uses Stripe, Inc. as a third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services). By making payments via the Services, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s US Terms of Services available at: https://stripe.com/us/terms and Privacy Policy available at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. By using the Services, you hereby consent and authorize Perpay and Stripe, Inc. to share any information and payment instructions you provide to complete your transactions. You agree to immediately notify Perpay of any change in your payment information by sending an email to hello@perpay.com. Please contact hello@perpay.com regarding any billing disputes. Refunds: Except as set forth in any separate refund policy posted on the Services, all payments are non-refundable.

We have put this Arbitration Clause (“Clause”) in question and answer form to make it easier to understand. However, this Clause is part of the Terms and Conditions and is legally binding. Background and Scope.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What is arbitration?	An alternative to a court case	In arbitration, a third party arbitrator (“TPA”) resolves “Claims” (as defined below) in a hearing. It is less formal than a court case.
Is it different from court and jury trials?	Yes	The hearing is private. There is no jury. It is usually less formal, faster and less expensive than a lawsuit. Pre-hearing fact finding (called “discovery”) is limited. Appeals are limited. Courts rarely overturn arbitration awards.
Can you opt-out of this Clause?	Yes, within 60 days	If you do not want this Clause to apply, you must send us a signed notice within 60 calendar days after you first use the Communication Facilities. You must send the notice by mail to Perpay Inc, 2400 Market Street, Suite 300, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103 (the “Notice Address”), Attn. “Arbitration Opt-Out.”
What is this Clause about?	The parties' agreement to arbitrate Claims	Unless you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such a member, protected by the Military Lending Act (a “Covered Consumer”) or unless you opt out, you and we agree that any party may elect to arbitrate or require arbitration of any "Claim" as defined below.
Who does the Clause cover?	You, us and certain "Related Parties"	This Clause governs you, us and our “Related Parties": (1) our parents, subsidiaries and affiliates; (2) employees, directors, officers, shareholders, members and representatives of ours or such other entities; and (3) any person or company (including Pinwheel) that is involved in a Claim you pursue at the same time you pursue a related Claim against us. However, this Clause does not apply if you are a Covered Consumer.
What Claims does the Clause cover?	All Claims (except certain Claims about this Clause)	This Clause governs all “Claims” that would usually be decided in court and are between you and us (or any Related Party). In this Clause, the word “Claims” has the broadest reasonable meaning. It includes contract and tort (including intentional tort) claims and claims under constitutions, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations. It includes all claims even indirectly related to the Communication Facilities, any Product, and purchase or our relationship with you. It includes claims related to collections, privacy and customer information. It includes claims related to the validity in general of the Agreement. However, it does not include Claims about the validity, coverage or scope of this Clause or any part of this Clause. All such Claims are for a court and not the TPA to decide.
Who handles the arbitration?	Usually AAA or JAMS	Arbitrations are conducted under this Clause and the rules of the arbitration company in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. However, arbitration rules that conflict with this Clause do not apply. The arbitration company will be either:
The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org.
JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018,www.jamsadr.com.
Any other company picked by agreement of the parties.
If all the above options are unavailable, a court will pick the arbitration company. No arbitration brought on a class basis may be administered without our consent by any arbitration company that would permit class arbitration under this Clause. The TPA will be selected under the arbitration company's rules. However, the arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge unless you and we otherwise agree.
Can Claims be brought in court?	Sometimes	You or we may bring a lawsuit if the other party does not demand arbitration. We will not demand arbitration of any lawsuit you bring as an individual action in small-claims court. However, we may demand arbitration of any appeal of a small-claims decision or any small-claims action brought on a class basis.
Are you giving up any rights?	Yes	For Claims subject to this Clause, you give up your right to:
Have juries decide Claims.
Have courts, other than small-claims courts, decide Claims.
Serve as a private attorney general or in a representative capacity.
Join a Claim you have with a Claim by other consumers.
Bring or be a class member in a class action or class arbitration.
We also give up the right to a jury trial and to have courts decide Claims you wish to arbitrate.
Can you or another consumer start class arbitration?	No	The TPA is not allowed to handle any Claim on a class or representative basis. All Claims subject to this Clause must be decided in an individual arbitration or an individual small-claims action. This Clause will be void if a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal.
What happens if part of this Clause cannot be enforced?	It depends.	If any portion of this Clause cannot be enforced, the rest of this Clause will continue to apply, except that:
If a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class or other representative basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal, only this sentence will apply and the remainder of this Clause will be void. AND
If a party brings a Claim seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in this Clause prohibiting the TPA from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such Claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court and any individual Claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties agree to request that the court stay the Claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court.
In no event will a Claim for class relief or public injunctive relief be arbitrated.
What law applies?	The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)	This Agreement involves interstate commerce. Thus, the FAA governs this Clause. The TPA must apply substantive law consistent with the FAA. The TPA must honor statutes of limitation and privilege rights. Punitive damages are governed by the constitutional standards that apply in judicial proceedings.
Will anything you do make this Clause ineffective?	No	This Clause stays in force even if: (1) any or all of the Agreements are ended; or (2) we transfer or assign our rights under any or all of the Agreements.
Process.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?	Send a written Claim Notice and work to resolve the Claim	Before starting a lawsuit or arbitration, the Claimant must comply with Section 18 of this Agreement, captioned “Notice and Cure.”
How does arbitration start?	Mailing a notice	If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 30 days after notice of the Claim is received, the Claimant may start a lawsuit or arbitration, subject to the terms of this Clause. To start arbitration, the Claimant picks the arbitration company and follows the arbitration company's rules. If one party starts or threatens a lawsuit, the other party can demand arbitration. This demand can be made in court papers. It can be made if a party starts a lawsuit on an individual basis and then tries to pursue a class action. Once an arbitration demand is made, no lawsuit can be brought and any existing lawsuit must stop.
Will any hearing be held nearby?	Yes	The TPA may decide that an in-person hearing is unnecessary and that he or she can resolve a Claim based on written filings and/or a conference call. However, any in-person arbitration hearing must be held at a place reasonably convenient to you.
What about appeals?	Very limited	Appeal rights under the FAA are very limited. The TPA's decision will be final and binding, except for any FAA appeal right. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award.
Do arbitration awards affect other disputes?	No	No arbitration award involving the parties will have any impact as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor will an arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have any impact in an arbitration between the parties to this Clause.
Arbitration Fees and Awards.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
Who bears arbitration fees?	Usually, we do	We will pay all filing, administrative, hearing and TPA fees if you act in good faith, cannot get a waiver of such fees and ask us to pay.
When will we cover your legal fees and costs?	If you win	If you win an arbitration, we will pay your reasonable fees and costs for attorneys, experts and witnesses. We will also pay these amounts if required under applicable law or the arbitration company's rules or if payment is required to enforce this Clause. The TPA shall not limit his or her award of these amounts because your Claim is for a small amount.
Will you ever owe us for arbitration or attorneys' fees?	Only for bad faith	The TPA can require you to pay fees incurred by us if (and only if): (1) the TPA finds that you have acted in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); and (2) this power does not make this Clause invalid.
Can a failure to resolve a Claim informally result in a larger recovery for you?	Yes	You are entitled to an arbitration award of at least $5,000 if: (1) you give us notice of a Claim on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) and comply with all of the requirements of this Clause (including the requirements described in response to the question reading "What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?)"; and (2) the TPA awards you money damages greater than the last amount you requested at least ten days before the arbitration commenced. This is in addition to the attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) to which you are otherwise entitled. This $5,000 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims you have raised or could have raised in the arbitration. Multiple awards of $5,000 are not contemplated by this Clause. Settlement demands and offers are strictly confidential. They may not be used in any proceeding by either party except to justify a minimum recovery of $5,000.
Can an award be explained?	Yes	A party may request details from the TPA, within 14 days of the ruling. Upon such request, the TPA will explain the ruling in writing.

Perpay will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described above. Information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user is not considered personal information and we may share aggregated, non-identifiable user information with third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances such as sharing your information so that third parties can market to you. However, because we will not share your information in these instances, there is no need for you to opt-out from this kind of information sharing. How We Protect Your Information
Perpay is committed to safeguarding your personal information through various industry standard policies and practices. We protect your account security by employing session time-outs, which log you out of the website after a specified time period, and by employing secure password practices, including password strength requirements and secure password reset procedures. Your password is not known to any employee or service provider of Perpay. We protect your data in our care by storing sensitive personal and financial information, such as bank account numbers, in a secure, off-site, hosted environment, which can only be read or written though defined service access points which are password-protected and accessible only to employees and service providers with a permitted need to access such information. We also protect your information in transit by employing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate technology which encrypts all data entered into our website and ensures the connection is secure. As an additional measure, we also require a 128-bit secure browser for logins and transactions. Cookies and Other Technologies
We use various technologies to collect and store non-personally identifiable information when you use the website. This may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your computer or mobile device, including web beacons, clear GIFs, pixel tags and other means.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to accept them or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Generally, information in your browser's "Help" section of the toolbar, or on the website of the browser designer or vendor, will explain how to turn off or modify your browser's settings regarding cookies.

Beginning January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California consumers the right to request that a business disclose what Personal information it collects, uses, discloses, and sells. CALIFORNIA INFORMATION If you are a California resident, you have certain rights with respect to your personal information. Those rights and how you may exercise them are described below. The fact that you have elected to exercise these rights will have no adverse effect on the price and quality of the products and services we offer. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATION ABOUT DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES FOR THEIR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES. You may request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties or affiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at hello@perpay.com. Please allow up to 30 days for us to process your request. You may submit such a request once per year. RIGHT TO KNOW. You may request that we provide you for the last 12 months a list of the categories of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which it was collected, the business purpose for collecting or “selling” the information, and the categories of “third parties” to whom we disclosed or “sold” that information. You may also request that we provide you in machine readable format a copy of the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the past 12 months. You may make a request to know up to two times in a 12-month period, subject to limitations described in the law. For a list of general categories of information that we have collected and shared in the past 12 months, see the “Information We Collect About You” and “Information We Share” sections of our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy. RIGHT TO DELETE. You may request that we delete any personal information that we have collected from you. However, the law exempts certain information from deletion. For example, we may keep information necessary for security and fraud detection. We also may keep information needed to provide you goods or services. For example, if you ask us to delete your data but retain your ability to purchase on Perpay, we will keep the information we need to continue providing you the ability to set up and manage your payments. When we respond to your request to delete, we will explain what (if any) information we have kept and why. Please note that the law does not consider anonymized or pseudonymized information to be “personal information,” and we may “delete” your information by anonymizing or pseudonymizing it. Information required to provide “consumer reports” as outlined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is also excluded from deletion. NON-DISCRIMINATION. You have the right to be free from discrimination for using these rights. We will not deny you goods or services, charge you different rates, or give you different discounts because you used one of these rights. HOW TO MAKE A REQUEST. You may make a request to know or delete by emailing hello@perpay.com or by calling (215) 834-4200. When you make a request, we will take steps to verify your identity before responding. This is to protect your information. We will ask you to provide us your email and physical address. If you maintain an account with us, these must match the addresses connected to your account. We will then send you a physical letter to this address with a one-time code. You must then log-in to Perpay and provide the one-time code to us via our live chat service. Once you do, we will respond to your request. AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES. You may also designate an authorized representative to make data subject rights requests on your behalf. We will require verification that you did in fact authorize the representative. Unless the law requires otherwise, your authorized representative must provide contact details for you. We will contact you to confirm that you authorized the representative. Once you confirm, we will promptly respond to the rights request. CONTACT FOR MORE INFORMATION. If you have questions please contact hello@perpay.com. RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF “SALE” OF PERSONAL INFORMATION If you are a California resident, you have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information to “third parties.” Sale is defined very broadly. The law defines “sale” more broadly than you might think. It doesn’t just include the exchange of data for money. Instead, it covers any transfer of personal information to a “third party” in exchange for “other valuable consideration.” We do not transfer your information to third parties in exchange for money and we will not do so. However, we do transfer personal information to certain third parties in order to operate our business (for example, to market our products and services). It is possible that someone could claim that this transfer was in exchange for “other valuable consideration.” We want to be careful with and respectful of your information. Therefore, if you opt out, we will not transfer your information to any “third party” except as explained below (and allowed by law). Opting out may have impacts you don’t expect. Any transfer of data to a “third party” may be considered a “sale” of data. The law considers any other business a “third party” unless that business agrees to specific contractual provisions. We try to get all of the businesses to whom we send information to add this special language to their contracts with us. But not everyone will or can agree to those terms. As a result, if you opt out of the “sale” of data, we will not be able to send data to some of our business partners. That may mean that, after you opt out, you may not receive all of the marketing and other information you are accustomed to receiving from us. In the extreme, if one of our critical partners cannot agree to the special contract language, and is considered a “third party”, it is possible that some features of our web site or other services may not work for you after you opt out. In addition, California law prevents us from asking you to “opt in” for a year after you “opt out.” We are allowed to tell you, however, if a specific transaction requires a transfer of data to a third party. We may alert you if a transaction requires a transfer to a third party so that you can opt in if you would like to continue with the transaction. Minors. We do not “sell” the data of people under 16, and do not intend to collect data related to people who are under 13. Exceptions to the opt out. The law creates several exceptions that are important for you to be aware of. We are allowed to transfer data to a “service provider” even if you opt out. The law does not consider that kind of transfer to be a “sale.” A service provider is a business that agrees not to use your information for any purpose other than providing the services specified in our contract. For example, we transfer data to business partners to provide data security and detect fraud. Those businesses are “service providers.” Even if you opt out, we will continue to transfer data to our service providers. We are also allowed to transfer your data to a third party where you direct the transfer or direct us to interact with the third party. For example, if you direct us to use a specific payment method to pay for your order, even if you have opted out, we will still transfer the data necessary to process your order. Collecting information and using it ourselves is not a “sale.” Opting out of the “sale” of your data does not prevent us from continuing to collect and process your personal information. You can learn more about how and why we collect personal information in our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy. The “opt out” only applies to “personal information.” This is information that is or is capable of being linked to you. That data is not “personal information.” Opting out will not limit our transfer of that data to third parties. Technical limitations on opt out. Please note that there are technical limits to our ability to identify data related to you and, if you opt out, to prevent the “sale” of that information to other parties. Where we can reasonably determine that information relates to you and you have opted out, we will not “sell” it to “third parties” (except as allowed by the law). However, we may not be able to determine that information relates to you. In that case, the information may be “sold” to a third party. Opting out is not unsubscribing. Opting out of the “sale” of personal information will not prevent you from receiving marketing messages from us. If you wish to unsubscribe from our emails, please follow the unsubscribe link in one of our emails. If you wish to unsubscribe from text messages, please follow the unsubscribe process for the program you opted into. HOW TO OPT OUT. If you would like to opt out of the “sale” of your data, you may email us at hello@perpay.com, or you may call us at (215) 834-4200. To use the email or phone number to opt out, you or your authorized representative will need to provide us the email address you wish to opt out. We will then send a message to that address. You must reply from that email address to complete the process. This extra step is to authenticate you and prevent fraud and abuse. If you want multiple email addresses opted out, you must provide each address to us. This is because we have no reasonable way to use a single address you give us to link to other addresses you may have. MORE ON PRIVACY. We take the security and privacy of your data very seriously. If you would like to learn more about it, please read our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy.

Order Acceptance: Each part of any order that you submit to Perpay constitutes an offer to purchase. If you do not receive a message from Perpay confirming receipt of your order, please contact our Customer Service department at hello@perpay.com before re-entering your order. Perpay’s confirmation of receipt of your order does not constitute Perpay's acceptance of your order. Perpay is only deemed to have accepted your order once the product(s) you ordered (the “Product(s)”) have been shipped. To make an order through the Services, you must be enrolled in Perpay’s payroll direct deposit program. Order Issues: Perpay reserves the right to deny any order for any reason, including if: (i) we discover an error in pricing and/or other information about the Product or receive insufficient or erroneous payment or shipping information, (ii) we suspect or it otherwise appears an order or associated payment may be connected to fraud, (iii) the Product is unavailable due to discontinuance or otherwise, (iv) you do not meet the eligibility requirements for use of the Services, or (v) you have exceeded your spending limit (vi) you have missed payments or made late payments in the past for a Perpay order. Returns: Please refer to our Return Policy found at: https://help.perpay.com/en/articles/108745-how-do-i-return-my-item if you would like to return any Product you purchased through the Services. Please note that the return policy varies by Product and not all Products are available for return. Please consult our Shipping and Return Policy for further details. Some items may be subject to a shipping and restocking fee. Damage claims must be submitted within 24-48 business hours of delivery, please inspect your order once it has arrived. Order Cancellation: If any Product is discontinued or otherwise becomes unavailable, Perpay reserves the right to cancel your order and provide you a credit for the amount paid for the Product. Restrictions on Resale: To protect the intellectual property rights of Perpay and its licensors and suppliers, to the extent permitted by law, any resale of Products for personal and/or business profit is strictly prohibited. Perpay reserves the right to decline any order that we deem to possess characteristics of reselling. Shipping: All items are prepared for shipment after your payment(s) via payroll direct deposit has been made on your scheduled payday. Risk of loss and title to items purchased from Perpay passes to the purchaser upon our delivery to the shipper. Depending upon your Product(s), shipments may be made in multiple packages and may be delivered on different dates. You will typically receive an email with tracking numbers within 3-5 business days of your first successful payment via payroll direct deposit, with the exception of furniture, mattresses, large TV's & other large appliances. These items are delivered via freight shipping and will require delivery to be scheduled with you directly. Please be advised it will take longer to generate tracking on freight delivery items. Items shipped via freight delivery (see individual product delivery details), in addition to all Ashley Furniture products, are unavailable to ship to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico Shipping surcharges may apply, but are not limited to, small parcel orders shipping to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Customers are not authorized to alter shipper delivery instructions in any way. If altered, Perpay Parties (as defined herein) and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss, claim, liability, or damage of any kind (“Loss”). This includes, but is not limited to, UPS My Choice. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Perpay Parties and the carrier from all Loss arising from or relating to the alterations of the delivery instructions. Perpay uses a third-party service provider for fulfilling orders. By ordering any Product through the Services, you acknowledge that Perpay has no responsibility or liability for any delays that may result from orders handled by such third-party service provider. Perpay Parties and the shipment carrier shall not be liable to you for any Loss, including but not limited to direct, indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages, whether based on contract or otherwise arising out of, or resulting from, UPS's provision of, or failure to provide, shipping service, including by following consignee instructions, failure to follow consignee instructions, delivery pursuant or contrary to consignee's instructions, misdelivery, or delayed delivery. By selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, you authorize the carrier to release packages addressed to you at your address when no one is present to receive the delivery and you will be asked and are required to accept responsibility for any loss or damage to the package after it has been released at the address. In no event shall Perpay Parties or the carrier be liable for any Loss, including but not limited to those arising out of, or resulting from loss, theft, alteration of, unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, your personal information, or other security breach, compromise, or incident involving your personal information, whether by third parties or otherwise, arising out of or resulting from the release of packages pursuant to the Authorized Shipment Release. Fees and Purchase Terms
Assessment of Spending Limit: Your “Approved Spending Limit” is the total dollar amount you may use towards purchases made through the Services. Your “Available Spending Limit” is your Approved Spending Limit minus any outstanding balances you have on your Account. Perpay may provide an estimated spending limit as a guide when placing your first order. Perpay reserves the right to change your spending limits at any time for any reason, including without limitation, your past payment history with Perpay or changes to your Account information. Promise to Pay:Each time you purchase a Product, you promise that you have the current intention and, to the best of your knowledge, you have the current ability to pay the full Perpay Purchase Price for the Product in accordance with the Perpay Payment Schedule. Absent a violation of this representation, you are not legally obligated to continue making payments. Accordingly, you do not “owe” us anything and, if you lose your job, have a medical emergency, encounter other unexpected financial difficulties you may cease making payments without legal liability to us. Of course, we ask you to do your best to resume payments when you can and will not approve further Product purchases while any scheduled payment under the Perpay Payment Schedule remains past due. Additionally, if you have enrolled in Perpay Plus and we are reporting your performance to one or more credit bureaus, we may report your failure to make all scheduled payments to one or more consumer reporting agencies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that your credit report may reflect late payments or missed payments. Additional Fees: Perpay will not charge any additional fees as result of missed or late payments. ACH/Credit/Debit Card Payment Authorization: In the event that you are unable to make payments through payroll direct deposit for an existing order(s), Perpay can charge your bank account (ACH), credit card or debit card (a “backup payment method”) on your behalf to satisfy your outstanding balance for an existing order(s). Payments made through a backup payment method can be made on a one-time or automatic recurring basis. Perpay will not make one-time or recurring charges using a backup payment method on your behalf without receiving your consent. A backup payment method can only be used to satisfy an outstanding balance for an existing order(s), you will not be able to move forward with a new order(s) until you are able to resume making payments through payroll direct deposit.

We have put this Arbitration Clause (“Clause”) in question and answer form to make it easier to understand. However, this Clause is part of the Terms and Conditions and is legally binding. Background and Scope.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What is arbitration?	An alternative to a court case	In arbitration, a third party arbitrator (“TPA”) resolves “Claims” (as defined below) in a hearing. It is less formal than a court case.
Is it different from court and jury trials?	Yes	The hearing is private. There is no jury. It is usually less formal, faster and less expensive than a lawsuit. Pre-hearing fact finding (called “discovery”) is limited. Appeals are limited. Courts rarely overturn arbitration awards.
Can you opt-out of this Clause?	Yes, within 60 days	If you do not want this Clause to apply, you must send us a signed notice within 60 calendar days after you first use the Communication Facilities. You must send the notice by mail to Perpay Inc, 2400 Market Street, Suite 300, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103 (the “Notice Address”), Attn. “Arbitration Opt-Out.”
What is this Clause about?	The parties' agreement to arbitrate Claims	Unless you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such a member, protected by the Military Lending Act (a “Covered Consumer”) or unless you opt out, you and we agree that any party may elect to arbitrate or require arbitration of any "Claim" as defined below.
Who does the Clause cover?	You, us and certain "Related Parties"	This Clause governs you, us and our “Related Parties": (1) our parents, subsidiaries and affiliates; (2) employees, directors, officers, shareholders, members and representatives of ours or such other entities; and (3) any person or company (including Pinwheel) that is involved in a Claim you pursue at the same time you pursue a related Claim against us. However, this Clause does not apply if you are a Covered Consumer.
What Claims does the Clause cover?	All Claims (except certain Claims about this Clause)	This Clause governs all “Claims” that would usually be decided in court and are between you and us (or any Related Party). In this Clause, the word “Claims” has the broadest reasonable meaning. It includes contract and tort (including intentional tort) claims and claims under constitutions, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations. It includes all claims even indirectly related to the Communication Facilities, any Product, and purchase or our relationship with you. It includes claims related to collections, privacy and customer information. It includes claims related to the validity in general of the Agreement. However, it does not include Claims about the validity, coverage or scope of this Clause or any part of this Clause. All such Claims are for a court and not the TPA to decide.
Who handles the arbitration?	Usually AAA or JAMS	Arbitrations are conducted under this Clause and the rules of the arbitration company in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. However, arbitration rules that conflict with this Clause do not apply. The arbitration company will be either:
The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org.
JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018,www.jamsadr.com.
Any other company picked by agreement of the parties.
If all the above options are unavailable, a court will pick the arbitration company. No arbitration brought on a class basis may be administered without our consent by any arbitration company that would permit class arbitration under this Clause. The TPA will be selected under the arbitration company's rules. However, the arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge unless you and we otherwise agree.
Can Claims be brought in court?	Sometimes	You or we may bring a lawsuit if the other party does not demand arbitration. We will not demand arbitration of any lawsuit you bring as an individual action in small-claims court. However, we may demand arbitration of any appeal of a small-claims decision or any small-claims action brought on a class basis.
Are you giving up any rights?	Yes	For Claims subject to this Clause, you give up your right to:
Have juries decide Claims.
Have courts, other than small-claims courts, decide Claims.
Serve as a private attorney general or in a representative capacity.
Join a Claim you have with a Claim by other consumers.
Bring or be a class member in a class action or class arbitration.
We also give up the right to a jury trial and to have courts decide Claims you wish to arbitrate.
Can you or another consumer start class arbitration?	No	The TPA is not allowed to handle any Claim on a class or representative basis. All Claims subject to this Clause must be decided in an individual arbitration or an individual small-claims action. This Clause will be void if a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal.
What happens if part of this Clause cannot be enforced?	It depends.	If any portion of this Clause cannot be enforced, the rest of this Clause will continue to apply, except that:
If a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class or other representative basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal, only this sentence will apply and the remainder of this Clause will be void. AND
If a party brings a Claim seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in this Clause prohibiting the TPA from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such Claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court and any individual Claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties agree to request that the court stay the Claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court.
In no event will a Claim for class relief or public injunctive relief be arbitrated.
What law applies?	The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)	This Agreement involves interstate commerce. Thus, the FAA governs this Clause. The TPA must apply substantive law consistent with the FAA. The TPA must honor statutes of limitation and privilege rights. Punitive damages are governed by the constitutional standards that apply in judicial proceedings.
Will anything you do make this Clause ineffective?	No	This Clause stays in force even if: (1) any or all of the Agreements are ended; or (2) we transfer or assign our rights under any or all of the Agreements.
Process.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?	Send a written Claim Notice and work to resolve the Claim	Before starting a lawsuit or arbitration, the Claimant must comply with Section 18 of this Agreement, captioned “Notice and Cure.”
How does arbitration start?	Mailing a notice	If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 30 days after notice of the Claim is received, the Claimant may start a lawsuit or arbitration, subject to the terms of this Clause. To start arbitration, the Claimant picks the arbitration company and follows the arbitration company's rules. If one party starts or threatens a lawsuit, the other party can demand arbitration. This demand can be made in court papers. It can be made if a party starts a lawsuit on an individual basis and then tries to pursue a class action. Once an arbitration demand is made, no lawsuit can be brought and any existing lawsuit must stop.
Will any hearing be held nearby?	Yes	The TPA may decide that an in-person hearing is unnecessary and that he or she can resolve a Claim based on written filings and/or a conference call. However, any in-person arbitration hearing must be held at a place reasonably convenient to you.
What about appeals?	Very limited	Appeal rights under the FAA are very limited. The TPA's decision will be final and binding, except for any FAA appeal right. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award.
Do arbitration awards affect other disputes?	No	No arbitration award involving the parties will have any impact as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor will an arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have any impact in an arbitration between the parties to this Clause.
Arbitration Fees and Awards.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
Who bears arbitration fees?	Usually, we do	We will pay all filing, administrative, hearing and TPA fees if you act in good faith, cannot get a waiver of such fees and ask us to pay.
When will we cover your legal fees and costs?	If you win	If you win an arbitration, we will pay your reasonable fees and costs for attorneys, experts and witnesses. We will also pay these amounts if required under applicable law or the arbitration company's rules or if payment is required to enforce this Clause. The TPA shall not limit his or her award of these amounts because your Claim is for a small amount.
Will you ever owe us for arbitration or attorneys' fees?	Only for bad faith	The TPA can require you to pay fees incurred by us if (and only if): (1) the TPA finds that you have acted in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); and (2) this power does not make this Clause invalid.
Can a failure to resolve a Claim informally result in a larger recovery for you?	Yes	You are entitled to an arbitration award of at least $5,000 if: (1) you give us notice of a Claim on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) and comply with all of the requirements of this Clause (including the requirements described in response to the question reading "What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?)"; and (2) the TPA awards you money damages greater than the last amount you requested at least ten days before the arbitration commenced. This is in addition to the attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) to which you are otherwise entitled. This $5,000 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims you have raised or could have raised in the arbitration. Multiple awards of $5,000 are not contemplated by this Clause. Settlement demands and offers are strictly confidential. They may not be used in any proceeding by either party except to justify a minimum recovery of $5,000.
Can an award be explained?	Yes	A party may request details from the TPA, within 14 days of the ruling. Upon such request, the TPA will explain the ruling in writing.

Order Acceptance: Each part of any order that you submit to Perpay constitutes an offer to purchase. If you do not receive a message from Perpay confirming receipt of your order, please contact our Customer Service department at hello@perpay.com before re-entering your order. Perpay’s confirmation of receipt of your order does not constitute Perpay's acceptance of your order. Perpay is only deemed to have accepted your order once the product(s) you ordered (the “Product(s)”) have been shipped. To make an order through the Services, you must be enrolled in Perpay’s payroll direct deposit program. Order Issues: Perpay reserves the right to deny any order for any reason, including if: (i) we discover an error in pricing and/or other information about the Product or receive insufficient or erroneous payment or shipping information, (ii) we suspect or it otherwise appears an order or associated payment may be connected to fraud, (iii) the Product is unavailable due to discontinuance or otherwise, (iv) you do not meet the eligibility requirements for use of the Services, or (v) you have exceeded your spending limit (vi) you have missed payments or made late payments in the past for a Perpay order. Returns: Please refer to our Return Policy found at: https://help.perpay.com/en/articles/108745-how-do-i-return-my-item if you would like to return any Product you purchased through the Services. Please note that the return policy varies by Product and not all Products are available for return. Please consult our Shipping and Return Policy for further details. Some items may be subject to a shipping and restocking fee. Damage claims must be submitted within 24-48 business hours of delivery, please inspect your order once it has arrived. Order Cancellation: If any Product is discontinued or otherwise becomes unavailable, Perpay reserves the right to cancel your order and provide you a credit for the amount paid for the Product. Restrictions on Resale: To protect the intellectual property rights of Perpay and its licensors and suppliers, to the extent permitted by law, any resale of Products for personal and/or business profit is strictly prohibited. Perpay reserves the right to decline any order that we deem to possess characteristics of reselling. Shipping: All items are prepared for shipment after your payment(s) via payroll direct deposit has been made on your scheduled payday. Risk of loss and title to items purchased from Perpay passes to the purchaser upon our delivery to the shipper. Depending upon your Product(s), shipments may be made in multiple packages and may be delivered on different dates. You will typically receive an email with tracking numbers within 3-5 business days of your first successful payment via payroll direct deposit, with the exception of furniture, mattresses, large TV's & other large appliances. These items are delivered via freight shipping and will require delivery to be scheduled with you directly. Please be advised it will take longer to generate tracking on freight delivery items. Items shipped via freight delivery (see individual product delivery details), in addition to all Ashley Furniture products, are unavailable to ship to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico Shipping surcharges may apply, but are not limited to, small parcel orders shipping to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Customers are not authorized to alter shipper delivery instructions in any way. If altered, Perpay Parties (as defined herein) and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss, claim, liability, or damage of any kind (“Loss”). This includes, but is not limited to, UPS My Choice. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Perpay Parties and the carrier from all Loss arising from or relating to the alterations of the delivery instructions. Perpay uses a third-party service provider for fulfilling orders. By ordering any Product through the Services, you acknowledge that Perpay has no responsibility or liability for any delays that may result from orders handled by such third-party service provider. Perpay Parties and the shipment carrier shall not be liable to you for any Loss, including but not limited to direct, indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages, whether based on contract or otherwise arising out of, or resulting from, UPS's provision of, or failure to provide, shipping service, including by following consignee instructions, failure to follow consignee instructions, delivery pursuant or contrary to consignee's instructions, misdelivery, or delayed delivery. By selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, you authorize the carrier to release packages addressed to you at your address when no one is present to receive the delivery and you will be asked and are required to accept responsibility for any loss or damage to the package after it has been released at the address. In no event shall Perpay Parties or the carrier be liable for any Loss, including but not limited to those arising out of, or resulting from loss, theft, alteration of, unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, your personal information, or other security breach, compromise, or incident involving your personal information, whether by third parties or otherwise, arising out of or resulting from the release of packages pursuant to the Authorized Shipment Release. Fees and Purchase Terms
Assessment of Spending Limit: Your “Approved Spending Limit” is the total dollar amount you may use towards purchases made through the Services. Your “Available Spending Limit” is your Approved Spending Limit minus any outstanding balances you have on your Account. Perpay may provide an estimated spending limit as a guide when placing your first order. Perpay reserves the right to change your spending limits at any time for any reason, including without limitation, your past payment history with Perpay or changes to your Account information. Promise to Pay:Each time you purchase a Product, you promise that you have the current intention and, to the best of your knowledge, you have the current ability to pay the full Perpay Purchase Price for the Product in accordance with the Perpay Payment Schedule. Absent a violation of this representation, you are not legally obligated to continue making payments. Accordingly, you do not “owe” us anything and, if you lose your job, have a medical emergency, encounter other unexpected financial difficulties you may cease making payments without legal liability to us. Of course, we ask you to do your best to resume payments when you can and will not approve further Product purchases while any scheduled payment under the Perpay Payment Schedule remains past due. Additionally, if you have enrolled in Perpay Plus and we are reporting your performance to one or more credit bureaus, we may report your failure to make all scheduled payments to one or more consumer reporting agencies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that your credit report may reflect late payments or missed payments. Additional Fees: Perpay will not charge any additional fees as result of missed or late payments. ACH/Credit/Debit Card Payment Authorization: In the event that you are unable to make payments through payroll direct deposit for an existing order(s), Perpay can charge your bank account (ACH), credit card or debit card (a “backup payment method”) on your behalf to satisfy your outstanding balance for an existing order(s). Payments made through a backup payment method can be made on a one-time or automatic recurring basis. Perpay will not make one-time or recurring charges using a backup payment method on your behalf without receiving your consent. A backup payment method can only be used to satisfy an outstanding balance for an existing order(s), you will not be able to move forward with a new order(s) until you are able to resume making payments through payroll direct deposit. The Backup Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated backup payment method, and you must refer to that agreement, not this Agreement, to determine your rights and liabilities. Perpay uses Stripe, Inc. as a third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services). By making payments via the Services, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s US Terms of Services available at: https://stripe.com/us/terms and Privacy Policy available at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. By using the Services, you hereby consent and authorize Perpay and Stripe, Inc. to share any information and payment instructions you provide to complete your transactions. You agree to immediately notify Perpay of any change in your payment information by sending an email to hello@perpay.com. Please contact hello@perpay.com regarding any billing disputes. Refunds: Except as set forth in any separate refund policy posted on the Services, all payments are non-refundable. Discounts and Promo Codes: We may, in our sole discretion, create discounts and promotional codes that may be redeemed for credit in your Account, or other features or benefits, subject to any additional terms that we establish on a per promotional code basis (“Promo Codes”). Promo Codes may only be used once per person. Only Promo Codes sent to you through official Perpay communications channels are valid. You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by us; (iii) may be disabled by us at any time for any reason without liability to us; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that we establish for such Promo Code; (v) are not redeemable for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. Responsibility for Content
Types of Content: You acknowledge that any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Services (collectively, “Content”), including the Services, is the sole responsibility of the party from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Perpay, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available (“Make Available”) through the Services (“Your Content”), and that you and other Registered Users of the Services, and not Perpay, are similarly responsible for all Content that you and they Make Available through the Services (“User Content”). No Obligation to Pre-Screen Content: You acknowledge that Perpay has no obligation to pre-screen Content (including, but not limited to, User Content), although Perpay reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any Content. By entering into the Agreement, you hereby provide your irrevocable consent to such monitoring. You acknowledge and agree that, except for your Registration Data, you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of Your Content, including without limitation chat, text, or voice communications. In the event that Perpay pre-screens, refuses or removes any Content, you acknowledge that Perpay will do so for Perpay’s benefit, not yours. Without limiting the foregoing, Perpay shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the Agreement or is otherwise objectionable. Storage: Unless expressly agreed to by Perpay in writing elsewhere, Perpay has no obligation to store any of Your Content that you Make Available on the Services. Perpay has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or accuracy of any Content, including Your Content; the failure to store, transmit or receive transmission of Content; or the security, privacy, storage, or transmission of other communications originating with or involving use of the Services. Certain Services may enable you to specify the level at which such Services restrict access to Your Content. You are solely responsible for applying the appropriate level of access to Your Content. If you do not choose, the system may default to its most permissive setting. You agree that Perpay retains the right to create reasonable limits on Perpay’s use and storage of the Content, including Your Content, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing capacity, and similar limits described on the Website and as otherwise determined by Perpay in its sole discretion. Restrictions: You may not Make Available any Content that: Is commercial or promotional in nature, without the prior written authorization of Perpay;

We have put this Arbitration Clause (“Clause”) in question and answer form to make it easier to understand. However, this Clause is part of the Terms and Conditions and is legally binding. Background and Scope.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What is arbitration?	An alternative to a court case	In arbitration, a third party arbitrator (“TPA”) resolves “Claims” (as defined below) in a hearing. It is less formal than a court case.
Is it different from court and jury trials?	Yes	The hearing is private. There is no jury. It is usually less formal, faster and less expensive than a lawsuit. Pre-hearing fact finding (called “discovery”) is limited. Appeals are limited. Courts rarely overturn arbitration awards.
Can you opt-out of this Clause?	Yes, within 60 days	If you do not want this Clause to apply, you must send us a signed notice within 60 calendar days after you first use the Communication Facilities. You must send the notice by mail to Perpay Inc, 2400 Market Street, Suite 300, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103 (the “Notice Address”), Attn. “Arbitration Opt-Out.”
What is this Clause about?	The parties' agreement to arbitrate Claims	Unless you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such a member, protected by the Military Lending Act (a “Covered Consumer”) or unless you opt out, you and we agree that any party may elect to arbitrate or require arbitration of any "Claim" as defined below.
Who does the Clause cover?	You, us and certain "Related Parties"	This Clause governs you, us and our “Related Parties": (1) our parents, subsidiaries and affiliates; (2) employees, directors, officers, shareholders, members and representatives of ours or such other entities; and (3) any person or company (including Pinwheel) that is involved in a Claim you pursue at the same time you pursue a related Claim against us. However, this Clause does not apply if you are a Covered Consumer.
What Claims does the Clause cover?	All Claims (except certain Claims about this Clause)	This Clause governs all “Claims” that would usually be decided in court and are between you and us (or any Related Party). In this Clause, the word “Claims” has the broadest reasonable meaning. It includes contract and tort (including intentional tort) claims and claims under constitutions, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations. It includes all claims even indirectly related to the Communication Facilities, any Product, and purchase or our relationship with you. It includes claims related to collections, privacy and customer information. It includes claims related to the validity in general of the Agreement. However, it does not include Claims about the validity, coverage or scope of this Clause or any part of this Clause. All such Claims are for a court and not the TPA to decide.
Who handles the arbitration?	Usually AAA or JAMS	Arbitrations are conducted under this Clause and the rules of the arbitration company in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. However, arbitration rules that conflict with this Clause do not apply. The arbitration company will be either:
The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org.
JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018,www.jamsadr.com.
Any other company picked by agreement of the parties.
If all the above options are unavailable, a court will pick the arbitration company. No arbitration brought on a class basis may be administered without our consent by any arbitration company that would permit class arbitration under this Clause. The TPA will be selected under the arbitration company's rules. However, the arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge unless you and we otherwise agree.
Can Claims be brought in court?	Sometimes	You or we may bring a lawsuit if the other party does not demand arbitration. We will not demand arbitration of any lawsuit you bring as an individual action in small-claims court. However, we may demand arbitration of any appeal of a small-claims decision or any small-claims action brought on a class basis.
Are you giving up any rights?	Yes	For Claims subject to this Clause, you give up your right to:
Have juries decide Claims.
Have courts, other than small-claims courts, decide Claims.
Serve as a private attorney general or in a representative capacity.
Join a Claim you have with a Claim by other consumers.
Bring or be a class member in a class action or class arbitration.
We also give up the right to a jury trial and to have courts decide Claims you wish to arbitrate.
Can you or another consumer start class arbitration?	No	The TPA is not allowed to handle any Claim on a class or representative basis. All Claims subject to this Clause must be decided in an individual arbitration or an individual small-claims action. This Clause will be void if a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal.
What happens if part of this Clause cannot be enforced?	It depends.	If any portion of this Clause cannot be enforced, the rest of this Clause will continue to apply, except that:
If a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class or other representative basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal, only this sentence will apply and the remainder of this Clause will be void. AND
If a party brings a Claim seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in this Clause prohibiting the TPA from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such Claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court and any individual Claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties agree to request that the court stay the Claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court.
In no event will a Claim for class relief or public injunctive relief be arbitrated.
What law applies?	The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)	This Agreement involves interstate commerce. Thus, the FAA governs this Clause. The TPA must apply substantive law consistent with the FAA. The TPA must honor statutes of limitation and privilege rights. Punitive damages are governed by the constitutional standards that apply in judicial proceedings.
Will anything you do make this Clause ineffective?	No	This Clause stays in force even if: (1) any or all of the Agreements are ended; or (2) we transfer or assign our rights under any or all of the Agreements.
Process.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?	Send a written Claim Notice and work to resolve the Claim	Before starting a lawsuit or arbitration, the Claimant must comply with Section 18 of this Agreement, captioned “Notice and Cure.”
How does arbitration start?	Mailing a notice	If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 30 days after notice of the Claim is received, the Claimant may start a lawsuit or arbitration, subject to the terms of this Clause. To start arbitration, the Claimant picks the arbitration company and follows the arbitration company's rules. If one party starts or threatens a lawsuit, the other party can demand arbitration. This demand can be made in court papers. It can be made if a party starts a lawsuit on an individual basis and then tries to pursue a class action. Once an arbitration demand is made, no lawsuit can be brought and any existing lawsuit must stop.
Will any hearing be held nearby?	Yes	The TPA may decide that an in-person hearing is unnecessary and that he or she can resolve a Claim based on written filings and/or a conference call. However, any in-person arbitration hearing must be held at a place reasonably convenient to you.
What about appeals?	Very limited	Appeal rights under the FAA are very limited. The TPA's decision will be final and binding, except for any FAA appeal right. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award.
Do arbitration awards affect other disputes?	No	No arbitration award involving the parties will have any impact as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor will an arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have any impact in an arbitration between the parties to this Clause.
Arbitration Fees and Awards.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
Who bears arbitration fees?	Usually, we do	We will pay all filing, administrative, hearing and TPA fees if you act in good faith, cannot get a waiver of such fees and ask us to pay.
When will we cover your legal fees and costs?	If you win	If you win an arbitration, we will pay your reasonable fees and costs for attorneys, experts and witnesses. We will also pay these amounts if required under applicable law or the arbitration company's rules or if payment is required to enforce this Clause. The TPA shall not limit his or her award of these amounts because your Claim is for a small amount.
Will you ever owe us for arbitration or attorneys' fees?	Only for bad faith	The TPA can require you to pay fees incurred by us if (and only if): (1) the TPA finds that you have acted in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); and (2) this power does not make this Clause invalid.
Can a failure to resolve a Claim informally result in a larger recovery for you?	Yes	You are entitled to an arbitration award of at least $5,000 if: (1) you give us notice of a Claim on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) and comply with all of the requirements of this Clause (including the requirements described in response to the question reading "What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?)"; and (2) the TPA awards you money damages greater than the last amount you requested at least ten days before the arbitration commenced. This is in addition to the attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) to which you are otherwise entitled. This $5,000 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims you have raised or could have raised in the arbitration. Multiple awards of $5,000 are not contemplated by this Clause. Settlement demands and offers are strictly confidential. They may not be used in any proceeding by either party except to justify a minimum recovery of $5,000.
Can an award be explained?	Yes	A party may request details from the TPA, within 14 days of the ruling. Upon such request, the TPA will explain the ruling in writing.

Beginning January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California consumers the right to request that a business disclose what Personal information it collects, uses, discloses, and sells. CALIFORNIA INFORMATION If you are a California resident, you have certain rights with respect to your personal information. Those rights and how you may exercise them are described below. The fact that you have elected to exercise these rights will have no adverse effect on the price and quality of the products and services we offer. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATION ABOUT DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES FOR THEIR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES. You may request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties or affiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at hello@perpay.com. Please allow up to 30 days for us to process your request. You may submit such a request once per year. RIGHT TO KNOW. You may request that we provide you for the last 12 months a list of the categories of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which it was collected, the business purpose for collecting or “selling” the information, and the categories of “third parties” to whom we disclosed or “sold” that information. You may also request that we provide you in machine readable format a copy of the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the past 12 months. You may make a request to know up to two times in a 12-month period, subject to limitations described in the law. For a list of general categories of information that we have collected and shared in the past 12 months, see the “Information We Collect About You” and “Information We Share” sections of our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy. RIGHT TO DELETE. You may request that we delete any personal information that we have collected from you. However, the law exempts certain information from deletion. For example, we may keep information necessary for security and fraud detection. We also may keep information needed to provide you goods or services. For example, if you ask us to delete your data but retain your ability to purchase on Perpay, we will keep the information we need to continue providing you the ability to set up and manage your payments. When we respond to your request to delete, we will explain what (if any) information we have kept and why. Please note that the law does not consider anonymized or pseudonymized information to be “personal information,” and we may “delete” your information by anonymizing or pseudonymizing it. Information required to provide “consumer reports” as outlined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is also excluded from deletion. NON-DISCRIMINATION. You have the right to be free from discrimination for using these rights. We will not deny you goods or services, charge you different rates, or give you different discounts because you used one of these rights. HOW TO MAKE A REQUEST. You may make a request to know or delete by emailing hello@perpay.com or by calling (215) 834-4200. When you make a request, we will take steps to verify your identity before responding. This is to protect your information. We will ask you to provide us your email and physical address. If you maintain an account with us, these must match the addresses connected to your account. We will then send you a physical letter to this address with a one-time code. You must then log-in to Perpay and provide the one-time code to us via our live chat service. Once you do, we will respond to your request. AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES. You may also designate an authorized representative to make data subject rights requests on your behalf. We will require verification that you did in fact authorize the representative. Unless the law requires otherwise, your authorized representative must provide contact details for you. We will contact you to confirm that you authorized the representative. Once you confirm, we will promptly respond to the rights request. CONTACT FOR MORE INFORMATION. If you have questions please contact hello@perpay.com. RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF “SALE” OF PERSONAL INFORMATION If you are a California resident, you have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information to “third parties.” Sale is defined very broadly. The law defines “sale” more broadly than you might think. It doesn’t just include the exchange of data for money. Instead, it covers any transfer of personal information to a “third party” in exchange for “other valuable consideration.” We do not transfer your information to third parties in exchange for money and we will not do so. However, we do transfer personal information to certain third parties in order to operate our business (for example, to market our products and services). It is possible that someone could claim that this transfer was in exchange for “other valuable consideration.” We want to be careful with and respectful of your information. Therefore, if you opt out, we will not transfer your information to any “third party” except as explained below (and allowed by law). Opting out may have impacts you don’t expect. Any transfer of data to a “third party” may be considered a “sale” of data. The law considers any other business a “third party” unless that business agrees to specific contractual provisions. We try to get all of the businesses to whom we send information to add this special language to their contracts with us. But not everyone will or can agree to those terms. As a result, if you opt out of the “sale” of data, we will not be able to send data to some of our business partners. That may mean that, after you opt out, you may not receive all of the marketing and other information you are accustomed to receiving from us. In the extreme, if one of our critical partners cannot agree to the special contract language, and is considered a “third party”, it is possible that some features of our web site or other services may not work for you after you opt out. In addition, California law prevents us from asking you to “opt in” for a year after you “opt out.” We are allowed to tell you, however, if a specific transaction requires a transfer of data to a third party. We may alert you if a transaction requires a transfer to a third party so that you can opt in if you would like to continue with the transaction. Minors. We do not “sell” the data of people under 16, and do not intend to collect data related to people who are under 13. Exceptions to the opt out. The law creates several exceptions that are important for you to be aware of. We are allowed to transfer data to a “service provider” even if you opt out. The law does not consider that kind of transfer to be a “sale.” A service provider is a business that agrees not to use your information for any purpose other than providing the services specified in our contract. For example, we transfer data to business partners to provide data security and detect fraud. Those businesses are “service providers.” Even if you opt out, we will continue to transfer data to our service providers. We are also allowed to transfer your data to a third party where you direct the transfer or direct us to interact with the third party. For example, if you direct us to use a specific payment method to pay for your order, even if you have opted out, we will still transfer the data necessary to process your order. Collecting information and using it ourselves is not a “sale.” Opting out of the “sale” of your data does not prevent us from continuing to collect and process your personal information. You can learn more about how and why we collect personal information in our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy. The “opt out” only applies to “personal information.” This is information that is or is capable of being linked to you. That data is not “personal information.” Opting out will not limit our transfer of that data to third parties. Technical limitations on opt out. Please note that there are technical limits to our ability to identify data related to you and, if you opt out, to prevent the “sale” of that information to other parties. Where we can reasonably determine that information relates to you and you have opted out, we will not “sell” it to “third parties” (except as allowed by the law). However, we may not be able to determine that information relates to you. In that case, the information may be “sold” to a third party. Opting out is not unsubscribing. Opting out of the “sale” of personal information will not prevent you from receiving marketing messages from us. If you wish to unsubscribe from our emails, please follow the unsubscribe link in one of our emails. If you wish to unsubscribe from text messages, please follow the unsubscribe process for the program you opted into. HOW TO OPT OUT. If you would like to opt out of the “sale” of your data, you may email us at hello@perpay.com, or you may call us at (215) 834-4200. To use the email or phone number to opt out, you or your authorized representative will need to provide us the email address you wish to opt out. We will then send a message to that address. You must reply from that email address to complete the process. This extra step is to authenticate you and prevent fraud and abuse. If you want multiple email addresses opted out, you must provide each address to us. This is because we have no reasonable way to use a single address you give us to link to other addresses you may have. MORE ON PRIVACY. We take the security and privacy of your data very seriously. If you would like to learn more about it, please read our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy.

Order Acceptance: Each part of any order that you submit to Perpay constitutes an offer to purchase. If you do not receive a message from Perpay confirming receipt of your order, please contact our Customer Service department at hello@perpay.com before re-entering your order. Perpay’s confirmation of receipt of your order does not constitute Perpay's acceptance of your order. Perpay is only deemed to have accepted your order once the product(s) you ordered (the “Product(s)”) have been shipped. To make an order through the Services, you must be enrolled in Perpay’s payroll direct deposit program. Order Issues: Perpay reserves the right to deny any order for any reason, including if: (i) we discover an error in pricing and/or other information about the Product or receive insufficient or erroneous payment or shipping information, (ii) we suspect or it otherwise appears an order or associated payment may be connected to fraud, (iii) the Product is unavailable due to discontinuance or otherwise, (iv) you do not meet the eligibility requirements for use of the Services, or (v) you have exceeded your spending limit (vi) you have missed payments or made late payments in the past for a Perpay order. Returns: Please refer to our Return Policy found at: https://help.perpay.com/en/articles/108745-how-do-i-return-my-item if you would like to return any Product you purchased through the Services. Please note that the return policy varies by Product and not all Products are available for return. Please consult our Shipping and Return Policy for further details. Some items may be subject to a shipping and restocking fee. Damage claims must be submitted within 24-48 business hours of delivery, please inspect your order once it has arrived. Order Cancellation: If any Product is discontinued or otherwise becomes unavailable, Perpay reserves the right to cancel your order and provide you a credit for the amount paid for the Product. Restrictions on Resale: To protect the intellectual property rights of Perpay and its licensors and suppliers, to the extent permitted by law, any resale of Products for personal and/or business profit is strictly prohibited. Perpay reserves the right to decline any order that we deem to possess characteristics of reselling. Shipping: All items are prepared for shipment after your payment(s) via payroll direct deposit has been made on your scheduled payday. Risk of loss and title to items purchased from Perpay passes to the purchaser upon our delivery to the shipper. Depending upon your Product(s), shipments may be made in multiple packages and may be delivered on different dates. You will typically receive an email with tracking numbers within 3-5 business days of your first successful payment via payroll direct deposit, with the exception of furniture, mattresses, large TV's & other large appliances. These items are delivered via freight shipping and will require delivery to be scheduled with you directly. Please be advised it will take longer to generate tracking on freight delivery items. Items shipped via freight delivery (see individual product delivery details), in addition to all Ashley Furniture products, are unavailable to ship to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico Shipping surcharges may apply, but are not limited to, small parcel orders shipping to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Customers are not authorized to alter shipper delivery instructions in any way. If altered, Perpay Parties (as defined herein) and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss, claim, liability, or damage of any kind (“Loss”). This includes, but is not limited to, UPS My Choice. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Perpay Parties and the carrier from all Loss arising from or relating to the alterations of the delivery instructions. Perpay uses a third-party service provider for fulfilling orders. By ordering any Product through the Services, you acknowledge that Perpay has no responsibility or liability for any delays that may result from orders handled by such third-party service provider. Perpay Parties and the shipment carrier shall not be liable to you for any Loss, including but not limited to direct, indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages, whether based on contract or otherwise arising out of, or resulting from, UPS's provision of, or failure to provide, shipping service, including by following consignee instructions, failure to follow consignee instructions, delivery pursuant or contrary to consignee's instructions, misdelivery, or delayed delivery. By selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, you authorize the carrier to release packages addressed to you at your address when no one is present to receive the delivery and you will be asked and are required to accept responsibility for any loss or damage to the package after it has been released at the address. In no event shall Perpay Parties or the carrier be liable for any Loss, including but not limited to those arising out of, or resulting from loss, theft, alteration of, unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, your personal information, or other security breach, compromise, or incident involving your personal information, whether by third parties or otherwise, arising out of or resulting from the release of packages pursuant to the Authorized Shipment Release. Fees and Purchase Terms
Assessment of Spending Limit: Your “Approved Spending Limit” is the total dollar amount you may use towards purchases made through the Services. Your “Available Spending Limit” is your Approved Spending Limit minus any outstanding balances you have on your Account. Perpay may provide an estimated spending limit as a guide when placing your first order. Perpay reserves the right to change your spending limits at any time for any reason, including without limitation, your past payment history with Perpay or changes to your Account information. Promise to Pay:Each time you purchase a Product, you promise that you have the current intention and, to the best of your knowledge, you have the current ability to pay the full Perpay Purchase Price for the Product in accordance with the Perpay Payment Schedule. Absent a violation of this representation, you are not legally obligated to continue making payments. Accordingly, you do not “owe” us anything and, if you lose your job, have a medical emergency, encounter other unexpected financial difficulties you may cease making payments without legal liability to us. Of course, we ask you to do your best to resume payments when you can and will not approve further Product purchases while any scheduled payment under the Perpay Payment Schedule remains past due. Additionally, if you have enrolled in Perpay Plus and we are reporting your performance to one or more credit bureaus, we may report your failure to make all scheduled payments to one or more consumer reporting agencies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that your credit report may reflect late payments or missed payments. Additional Fees: Perpay will not charge any additional fees as result of missed or late payments. ACH/Credit/Debit Card Payment Authorization: In the event that you are unable to make payments through payroll direct deposit for an existing order(s), Perpay can charge your bank account (ACH), credit card or debit card (a “backup payment method”) on your behalf to satisfy your outstanding balance for an existing order(s). Payments made through a backup payment method can be made on a one-time or automatic recurring basis. Perpay will not make one-time or recurring charges using a backup payment method on your behalf without receiving your consent. A backup payment method can only be used to satisfy an outstanding balance for an existing order(s), you will not be able to move forward with a new order(s) until you are able to resume making payments through payroll direct deposit. The Backup Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated backup payment method, and you must refer to that agreement, not this Agreement, to determine your rights and liabilities. Perpay uses Stripe, Inc. as a third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services). By making payments via the Services, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s US Terms of Services available at: https://stripe.com/us/terms and Privacy Policy available at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. By using the Services, you hereby consent and authorize Perpay and Stripe, Inc. to share any information and payment instructions you provide to complete your transactions. You agree to immediately notify Perpay of any change in your payment information by sending an email to hello@perpay.com. Please contact hello@perpay.com regarding any billing disputes. Refunds: Except as set forth in any separate refund policy posted on the Services, all payments are non-refundable.

We have put this Arbitration Clause (“Clause”) in question and answer form to make it easier to understand. However, this Clause is part of the Terms and Conditions and is legally binding. Background and Scope.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What is arbitration?	An alternative to a court case	In arbitration, a third party arbitrator (“TPA”) resolves “Claims” (as defined below) in a hearing. It is less formal than a court case.
Is it different from court and jury trials?	Yes	The hearing is private. There is no jury. It is usually less formal, faster and less expensive than a lawsuit. Pre-hearing fact finding (called “discovery”) is limited. Appeals are limited. Courts rarely overturn arbitration awards.
Can you opt-out of this Clause?	Yes, within 60 days	If you do not want this Clause to apply, you must send us a signed notice within 60 calendar days after you first use the Communication Facilities. You must send the notice by mail to Perpay Inc, 2400 Market Street, Suite 300, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103 (the “Notice Address”), Attn. “Arbitration Opt-Out.”
What is this Clause about?	The parties' agreement to arbitrate Claims	Unless you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such a member, protected by the Military Lending Act (a “Covered Consumer”) or unless you opt out, you and we agree that any party may elect to arbitrate or require arbitration of any "Claim" as defined below.
Who does the Clause cover?	You, us and certain "Related Parties"	This Clause governs you, us and our “Related Parties": (1) our parents, subsidiaries and affiliates; (2) employees, directors, officers, shareholders, members and representatives of ours or such other entities; and (3) any person or company (including Pinwheel) that is involved in a Claim you pursue at the same time you pursue a related Claim against us. However, this Clause does not apply if you are a Covered Consumer.
What Claims does the Clause cover?	All Claims (except certain Claims about this Clause)	This Clause governs all “Claims” that would usually be decided in court and are between you and us (or any Related Party). In this Clause, the word “Claims” has the broadest reasonable meaning. It includes contract and tort (including intentional tort) claims and claims under constitutions, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations. It includes all claims even indirectly related to the Communication Facilities, any Product, and purchase or our relationship with you. It includes claims related to collections, privacy and customer information. It includes claims related to the validity in general of the Agreement. However, it does not include Claims about the validity, coverage or scope of this Clause or any part of this Clause. All such Claims are for a court and not the TPA to decide.
Who handles the arbitration?	Usually AAA or JAMS	Arbitrations are conducted under this Clause and the rules of the arbitration company in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. However, arbitration rules that conflict with this Clause do not apply. The arbitration company will be either:
The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org.
JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018,www.jamsadr.com.
Any other company picked by agreement of the parties.
If all the above options are unavailable, a court will pick the arbitration company. No arbitration brought on a class basis may be administered without our consent by any arbitration company that would permit class arbitration under this Clause. The TPA will be selected under the arbitration company's rules. However, the arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge unless you and we otherwise agree.
Can Claims be brought in court?	Sometimes	You or we may bring a lawsuit if the other party does not demand arbitration. We will not demand arbitration of any lawsuit you bring as an individual action in small-claims court. However, we may demand arbitration of any appeal of a small-claims decision or any small-claims action brought on a class basis.
Are you giving up any rights?	Yes	For Claims subject to this Clause, you give up your right to:
Have juries decide Claims.
Have courts, other than small-claims courts, decide Claims.
Serve as a private attorney general or in a representative capacity.
Join a Claim you have with a Claim by other consumers.
Bring or be a class member in a class action or class arbitration.
We also give up the right to a jury trial and to have courts decide Claims you wish to arbitrate.
Can you or another consumer start class arbitration?	No	The TPA is not allowed to handle any Claim on a class or representative basis. All Claims subject to this Clause must be decided in an individual arbitration or an individual small-claims action. This Clause will be void if a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal.
What happens if part of this Clause cannot be enforced?	It depends.	If any portion of this Clause cannot be enforced, the rest of this Clause will continue to apply, except that:
If a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class or other representative basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal, only this sentence will apply and the remainder of this Clause will be void. AND
If a party brings a Claim seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in this Clause prohibiting the TPA from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such Claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court and any individual Claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties agree to request that the court stay the Claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court.
In no event will a Claim for class relief or public injunctive relief be arbitrated.
What law applies?	The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)	This Agreement involves interstate commerce. Thus, the FAA governs this Clause. The TPA must apply substantive law consistent with the FAA. The TPA must honor statutes of limitation and privilege rights. Punitive damages are governed by the constitutional standards that apply in judicial proceedings.
Will anything you do make this Clause ineffective?	No	This Clause stays in force even if: (1) any or all of the Agreements are ended; or (2) we transfer or assign our rights under any or all of the Agreements.
Process.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?	Send a written Claim Notice and work to resolve the Claim	Before starting a lawsuit or arbitration, the Claimant must comply with Section 18 of this Agreement, captioned “Notice and Cure.”
How does arbitration start?	Mailing a notice	If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 30 days after notice of the Claim is received, the Claimant may start a lawsuit or arbitration, subject to the terms of this Clause. To start arbitration, the Claimant picks the arbitration company and follows the arbitration company's rules. If one party starts or threatens a lawsuit, the other party can demand arbitration. This demand can be made in court papers. It can be made if a party starts a lawsuit on an individual basis and then tries to pursue a class action. Once an arbitration demand is made, no lawsuit can be brought and any existing lawsuit must stop.
Will any hearing be held nearby?	Yes	The TPA may decide that an in-person hearing is unnecessary and that he or she can resolve a Claim based on written filings and/or a conference call. However, any in-person arbitration hearing must be held at a place reasonably convenient to you.
What about appeals?	Very limited	Appeal rights under the FAA are very limited. The TPA's decision will be final and binding, except for any FAA appeal right. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award.
Do arbitration awards affect other disputes?	No	No arbitration award involving the parties will have any impact as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor will an arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have any impact in an arbitration between the parties to this Clause.
Arbitration Fees and Awards.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
Who bears arbitration fees?	Usually, we do	We will pay all filing, administrative, hearing and TPA fees if you act in good faith, cannot get a waiver of such fees and ask us to pay.
When will we cover your legal fees and costs?	If you win	If you win an arbitration, we will pay your reasonable fees and costs for attorneys, experts and witnesses. We will also pay these amounts if required under applicable law or the arbitration company's rules or if payment is required to enforce this Clause. The TPA shall not limit his or her award of these amounts because your Claim is for a small amount.
Will you ever owe us for arbitration or attorneys' fees?	Only for bad faith	The TPA can require you to pay fees incurred by us if (and only if): (1) the TPA finds that you have acted in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); and (2) this power does not make this Clause invalid.
Can a failure to resolve a Claim informally result in a larger recovery for you?	Yes	You are entitled to an arbitration award of at least $5,000 if: (1) you give us notice of a Claim on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) and comply with all of the requirements of this Clause (including the requirements described in response to the question reading "What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?)"; and (2) the TPA awards you money damages greater than the last amount you requested at least ten days before the arbitration commenced. This is in addition to the attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) to which you are otherwise entitled. This $5,000 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims you have raised or could have raised in the arbitration. Multiple awards of $5,000 are not contemplated by this Clause. Settlement demands and offers are strictly confidential. They may not be used in any proceeding by either party except to justify a minimum recovery of $5,000.
Can an award be explained?	Yes	A party may request details from the TPA, within 14 days of the ruling. Upon such request, the TPA will explain the ruling in writing.

Order Acceptance: Each part of any order that you submit to Perpay constitutes an offer to purchase. If you do not receive a message from Perpay confirming receipt of your order, please contact our Customer Service department at hello@perpay.com before re-entering your order. Perpay’s confirmation of receipt of your order does not constitute Perpay's acceptance of your order. Perpay is only deemed to have accepted your order once the product(s) you ordered (the “Product(s)”) have been shipped. To make an order through the Services, you must be enrolled in Perpay’s payroll direct deposit program. Order Issues: Perpay reserves the right to deny any order for any reason, including if: (i) we discover an error in pricing and/or other information about the Product or receive insufficient or erroneous payment or shipping information, (ii) we suspect or it otherwise appears an order or associated payment may be connected to fraud, (iii) the Product is unavailable due to discontinuance or otherwise, (iv) you do not meet the eligibility requirements for use of the Services, or (v) you have exceeded your spending limit (vi) you have missed payments or made late payments in the past for a Perpay order. Returns: Please refer to our Return Policy found at: https://help.perpay.com/en/articles/108745-how-do-i-return-my-item if you would like to return any Product you purchased through the Services. Please note that the return policy varies by Product and not all Products are available for return. Please consult our Shipping and Return Policy for further details. Some items may be subject to a shipping and restocking fee. Damage claims must be submitted within 24-48 business hours of delivery, please inspect your order once it has arrived. Order Cancellation: If any Product is discontinued or otherwise becomes unavailable, Perpay reserves the right to cancel your order and provide you a credit for the amount paid for the Product. Restrictions on Resale: To protect the intellectual property rights of Perpay and its licensors and suppliers, to the extent permitted by law, any resale of Products for personal and/or business profit is strictly prohibited. Perpay reserves the right to decline any order that we deem to possess characteristics of reselling. Shipping: All items are prepared for shipment after your payment(s) via payroll direct deposit has been made on your scheduled payday. Risk of loss and title to items purchased from Perpay passes to the purchaser upon our delivery to the shipper. Depending upon your Product(s), shipments may be made in multiple packages and may be delivered on different dates. You will typically receive an email with tracking numbers within 3-5 business days of your first successful payment via payroll direct deposit, with the exception of furniture, mattresses, large TV's & other large appliances. These items are delivered via freight shipping and will require delivery to be scheduled with you directly. Please be advised it will take longer to generate tracking on freight delivery items. Items shipped via freight delivery (see individual product delivery details), in addition to all Ashley Furniture products, are unavailable to ship to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico Shipping surcharges may apply, but are not limited to, small parcel orders shipping to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Customers are not authorized to alter shipper delivery instructions in any way. If altered, Perpay Parties (as defined herein) and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss, claim, liability, or damage of any kind (“Loss”). This includes, but is not limited to, UPS My Choice. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Perpay Parties and the carrier from all Loss arising from or relating to the alterations of the delivery instructions. Perpay uses a third-party service provider for fulfilling orders. By ordering any Product through the Services, you acknowledge that Perpay has no responsibility or liability for any delays that may result from orders handled by such third-party service provider. Perpay Parties and the shipment carrier shall not be liable to you for any Loss, including but not limited to direct, indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages, whether based on contract or otherwise arising out of, or resulting from, UPS's provision of, or failure to provide, shipping service, including by following consignee instructions, failure to follow consignee instructions, delivery pursuant or contrary to consignee's instructions, misdelivery, or delayed delivery. By selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, you authorize the carrier to release packages addressed to you at your address when no one is present to receive the delivery and you will be asked and are required to accept responsibility for any loss or damage to the package after it has been released at the address. In no event shall Perpay Parties or the carrier be liable for any Loss, including but not limited to those arising out of, or resulting from loss, theft, alteration of, unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, your personal information, or other security breach, compromise, or incident involving your personal information, whether by third parties or otherwise, arising out of or resulting from the release of packages pursuant to the Authorized Shipment Release. Fees and Purchase Terms
Assessment of Spending Limit: Your “Approved Spending Limit” is the total dollar amount you may use towards purchases made through the Services. Your “Available Spending Limit” is your Approved Spending Limit minus any outstanding balances you have on your Account. Perpay may provide an estimated spending limit as a guide when placing your first order. Perpay reserves the right to change your spending limits at any time for any reason, including without limitation, your past payment history with Perpay or changes to your Account information. Promise to Pay:Each time you purchase a Product, you promise that you have the current intention and, to the best of your knowledge, you have the current ability to pay the full Perpay Purchase Price for the Product in accordance with the Perpay Payment Schedule. Absent a violation of this representation, you are not legally obligated to continue making payments. Accordingly, you do not “owe” us anything and, if you lose your job, have a medical emergency, encounter other unexpected financial difficulties you may cease making payments without legal liability to us. Of course, we ask you to do your best to resume payments when you can and will not approve further Product purchases while any scheduled payment under the Perpay Payment Schedule remains past due. Additionally, if you have enrolled in Perpay Plus and we are reporting your performance to one or more credit bureaus, we may report your failure to make all scheduled payments to one or more consumer reporting agencies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that your credit report may reflect late payments or missed payments. Additional Fees: Perpay will not charge any additional fees as result of missed or late payments. ACH/Credit/Debit Card Payment Authorization: In the event that you are unable to make payments through payroll direct deposit for an existing order(s), Perpay can charge your bank account (ACH), credit card or debit card (a “backup payment method”) on your behalf to satisfy your outstanding balance for an existing order(s). Payments made through a backup payment method can be made on a one-time or automatic recurring basis. Perpay will not make one-time or recurring charges using a backup payment method on your behalf without receiving your consent. A backup payment method can only be used to satisfy an outstanding balance for an existing order(s), you will not be able to move forward with a new order(s) until you are able to resume making payments through payroll direct deposit. The Backup Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated backup payment method, and you must refer to that agreement, not this Agreement, to determine your rights and liabilities. Perpay uses Stripe, Inc. as a third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services). By making payments via the Services, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s US Terms of Services available at: https://stripe.com/us/terms and Privacy Policy available at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. By using the Services, you hereby consent and authorize Perpay and Stripe, Inc. to share any information and payment instructions you provide to complete your transactions. You agree to immediately notify Perpay of any change in your payment information by sending an email to hello@perpay.com. Please contact hello@perpay.com regarding any billing disputes. Refunds: Except as set forth in any separate refund policy posted on the Services, all payments are non-refundable. Discounts and Promo Codes: We may, in our sole discretion, create discounts and promotional codes that may be redeemed for credit in your Account, or other features or benefits, subject to any additional terms that we establish on a per promotional code basis (“Promo Codes”). Promo Codes may only be used once per person. Only Promo Codes sent to you through official Perpay communications channels are valid. You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by us; (iii) may be disabled by us at any time for any reason without liability to us; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that we establish for such Promo Code; (v) are not redeemable for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use.

This means that you, and not Perpay, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available (“Make Available”) through the Services (“Your Content”), and that you and other Registered Users of the Services, and not Perpay, are similarly responsible for all Content that you and they Make Available through the Services (“User Content”).

If you do not choose, the system may default to its most permissive setting. You agree that Perpay retains the right to create reasonable limits on Perpay’s use and storage of the Content, including Your Content, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing capacity, and similar limits described on the Website and as otherwise determined by Perpay in its sole discretion.

We have put this Arbitration Clause (“Clause”) in question and answer form to make it easier to understand. However, this Clause is part of the Terms and Conditions and is legally binding. Background and Scope.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What is arbitration?	An alternative to a court case	In arbitration, a third party arbitrator (“TPA”) resolves “Claims” (as defined below) in a hearing. It is less formal than a court case.
Is it different from court and jury trials?	Yes	The hearing is private. There is no jury. It is usually less formal, faster and less expensive than a lawsuit. Pre-hearing fact finding (called “discovery”) is limited. Appeals are limited. Courts rarely overturn arbitration awards.
Can you opt-out of this Clause?	Yes, within 60 days	If you do not want this Clause to apply, you must send us a signed notice within 60 calendar days after you first use the Communication Facilities. You must send the notice by mail to Perpay Inc, 2400 Market Street, Suite 300, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103 (the “Notice Address”), Attn. “Arbitration Opt-Out.”
What is this Clause about?	The parties' agreement to arbitrate Claims	Unless you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such a member, protected by the Military Lending Act (a “Covered Consumer”) or unless you opt out, you and we agree that any party may elect to arbitrate or require arbitration of any "Claim" as defined below.
Who does the Clause cover?	You, us and certain "Related Parties"	This Clause governs you, us and our “Related Parties": (1) our parents, subsidiaries and affiliates; (2) employees, directors, officers, shareholders, members and representatives of ours or such other entities; and (3) any person or company (including Pinwheel) that is involved in a Claim you pursue at the same time you pursue a related Claim against us. However, this Clause does not apply if you are a Covered Consumer.
What Claims does the Clause cover?	All Claims (except certain Claims about this Clause)	This Clause governs all “Claims” that would usually be decided in court and are between you and us (or any Related Party). In this Clause, the word “Claims” has the broadest reasonable meaning. It includes contract and tort (including intentional tort) claims and claims under constitutions, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations. It includes all claims even indirectly related to the Communication Facilities, any Product, and purchase or our relationship with you. It includes claims related to collections, privacy and customer information. It includes claims related to the validity in general of the Agreement. However, it does not include Claims about the validity, coverage or scope of this Clause or any part of this Clause. All such Claims are for a court and not the TPA to decide.
Who handles the arbitration?	Usually AAA or JAMS	Arbitrations are conducted under this Clause and the rules of the arbitration company in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. However, arbitration rules that conflict with this Clause do not apply. The arbitration company will be either:
The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org.
JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018,www.jamsadr.com.
Any other company picked by agreement of the parties.
If all the above options are unavailable, a court will pick the arbitration company. No arbitration brought on a class basis may be administered without our consent by any arbitration company that would permit class arbitration under this Clause. The TPA will be selected under the arbitration company's rules. However, the arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge unless you and we otherwise agree.
Can Claims be brought in court?	Sometimes	You or we may bring a lawsuit if the other party does not demand arbitration. We will not demand arbitration of any lawsuit you bring as an individual action in small-claims court. However, we may demand arbitration of any appeal of a small-claims decision or any small-claims action brought on a class basis.
Are you giving up any rights?	Yes	For Claims subject to this Clause, you give up your right to:
Have juries decide Claims.
Have courts, other than small-claims courts, decide Claims.
Serve as a private attorney general or in a representative capacity.
Join a Claim you have with a Claim by other consumers.
Bring or be a class member in a class action or class arbitration.
We also give up the right to a jury trial and to have courts decide Claims you wish to arbitrate.
Can you or another consumer start class arbitration?	No	The TPA is not allowed to handle any Claim on a class or representative basis. All Claims subject to this Clause must be decided in an individual arbitration or an individual small-claims action. This Clause will be void if a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal.
What happens if part of this Clause cannot be enforced?	It depends.	If any portion of this Clause cannot be enforced, the rest of this Clause will continue to apply, except that:
If a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class or other representative basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal, only this sentence will apply and the remainder of this Clause will be void. AND
If a party brings a Claim seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in this Clause prohibiting the TPA from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such Claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court and any individual Claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties agree to request that the court stay the Claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court.
In no event will a Claim for class relief or public injunctive relief be arbitrated.
What law applies?	The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)	This Agreement involves interstate commerce. Thus, the FAA governs this Clause. The TPA must apply substantive law consistent with the FAA. The TPA must honor statutes of limitation and privilege rights. Punitive damages are governed by the constitutional standards that apply in judicial proceedings.
Will anything you do make this Clause ineffective?	No	This Clause stays in force even if: (1) any or all of the Agreements are ended; or (2) we transfer or assign our rights under any or all of the Agreements.
Process.

What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?	Send a written Claim Notice and work to resolve the Claim	Before starting a lawsuit or arbitration, the Claimant must comply with Section 18 of this Agreement, captioned “Notice and Cure.”
How does arbitration start?	Mailing a notice	If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 30 days after notice of the Claim is received, the Claimant may start a lawsuit or arbitration, subject to the terms of this Clause. To start arbitration, the Claimant picks the arbitration company and follows the arbitration company's rules. If one party starts or threatens a lawsuit, the other party can demand arbitration. This demand can be made in court papers. It can be made if a party starts a lawsuit on an individual basis and then tries to pursue a class action. Once an arbitration demand is made, no lawsuit can be brought and any existing lawsuit must stop.
Will any hearing be held nearby?	Yes	The TPA may decide that an in-person hearing is unnecessary and that he or she can resolve a Claim based on written filings and/or a conference call. However, any in-person arbitration hearing must be held at a place reasonably convenient to you.
What about appeals?	Very limited	Appeal rights under the FAA are very limited. The TPA's decision will be final and binding, except for any FAA appeal right. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award.
Do arbitration awards affect other disputes?	No	No arbitration award involving the parties will have any impact as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor will an arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have any impact in an arbitration between the parties to this Clause.
Arbitration Fees and Awards.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
Who bears arbitration fees?	Usually, we do	We will pay all filing, administrative, hearing and TPA fees if you act in good faith, cannot get a waiver of such fees and ask us to pay.
When will we cover your legal fees and costs?	If you win	If you win an arbitration, we will pay your reasonable fees and costs for attorneys, experts and witnesses. We will also pay these amounts if required under applicable law or the arbitration company's rules or if payment is required to enforce this Clause. The TPA shall not limit his or her award of these amounts because your Claim is for a small amount.
Will you ever owe us for arbitration or attorneys' fees?	Only for bad faith	The TPA can require you to pay fees incurred by us if (and only if): (1) the TPA finds that you have acted in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); and (2) this power does not make this Clause invalid.
Can a failure to resolve a Claim informally result in a larger recovery for you?	Yes	You are entitled to an arbitration award of at least $5,000 if: (1) you give us notice of a Claim on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) and comply with all of the requirements of this Clause (including the requirements described in response to the question reading "What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?)"; and (2) the TPA awards you money damages greater than the last amount you requested at least ten days before the arbitration commenced. This is in addition to the attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) to which you are otherwise entitled. This $5,000 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims you have raised or could have raised in the arbitration. Multiple awards of $5,000 are not contemplated by this Clause. Settlement demands and offers are strictly confidential. They may not be used in any proceeding by either party except to justify a minimum recovery of $5,000.
Can an award be explained?	Yes	A party may request details from the TPA, within 14 days of the ruling. Upon such request, the TPA will explain the ruling in writing.

Beginning January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California consumers the right to request that a business disclose what Personal information it collects, uses, discloses, and sells. CALIFORNIA INFORMATION If you are a California resident, you have certain rights with respect to your personal information. Those rights and how you may exercise them are described below. The fact that you have elected to exercise these rights will have no adverse effect on the price and quality of the products and services we offer. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATION ABOUT DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES FOR THEIR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES. You may request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties or affiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at hello@perpay.com. Please allow up to 30 days for us to process your request. You may submit such a request once per year. RIGHT TO KNOW. You may request that we provide you for the last 12 months a list of the categories of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which it was collected, the business purpose for collecting or “selling” the information, and the categories of “third parties” to whom we disclosed or “sold” that information. You may also request that we provide you in machine readable format a copy of the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the past 12 months. You may make a request to know up to two times in a 12-month period, subject to limitations described in the law. For a list of general categories of information that we have collected and shared in the past 12 months, see the “Information We Collect About You” and “Information We Share” sections of our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy. RIGHT TO DELETE. You may request that we delete any personal information that we have collected from you. However, the law exempts certain information from deletion. For example, we may keep information necessary for security and fraud detection. We also may keep information needed to provide you goods or services. For example, if you ask us to delete your data but retain your ability to purchase on Perpay, we will keep the information we need to continue providing you the ability to set up and manage your payments. When we respond to your request to delete, we will explain what (if any) information we have kept and why. Please note that the law does not consider anonymized or pseudonymized information to be “personal information,” and we may “delete” your information by anonymizing or pseudonymizing it. Information required to provide “consumer reports” as outlined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is also excluded from deletion. NON-DISCRIMINATION. You have the right to be free from discrimination for using these rights. We will not deny you goods or services, charge you different rates, or give you different discounts because you used one of these rights. HOW TO MAKE A REQUEST. You may make a request to know or delete by emailing hello@perpay.com or by calling (215) 834-4200. When you make a request, we will take steps to verify your identity before responding. This is to protect your information. We will ask you to provide us your email and physical address. If you maintain an account with us, these must match the addresses connected to your account. We will then send you a physical letter to this address with a one-time code. You must then log-in to Perpay and provide the one-time code to us via our live chat service. Once you do, we will respond to your request. AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES. You may also designate an authorized representative to make data subject rights requests on your behalf. We will require verification that you did in fact authorize the representative. Unless the law requires otherwise, your authorized representative must provide contact details for you. We will contact you to confirm that you authorized the representative. Once you confirm, we will promptly respond to the rights request. CONTACT FOR MORE INFORMATION. If you have questions please contact hello@perpay.com. RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF “SALE” OF PERSONAL INFORMATION If you are a California resident, you have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information to “third parties.” Sale is defined very broadly. The law defines “sale” more broadly than you might think. It doesn’t just include the exchange of data for money. Instead, it covers any transfer of personal information to a “third party” in exchange for “other valuable consideration.” We do not transfer your information to third parties in exchange for money and we will not do so. However, we do transfer personal information to certain third parties in order to operate our business (for example, to market our products and services). It is possible that someone could claim that this transfer was in exchange for “other valuable consideration.” We want to be careful with and respectful of your information. Therefore, if you opt out, we will not transfer your information to any “third party” except as explained below (and allowed by law). Opting out may have impacts you don’t expect. Any transfer of data to a “third party” may be considered a “sale” of data. The law considers any other business a “third party” unless that business agrees to specific contractual provisions. We try to get all of the businesses to whom we send information to add this special language to their contracts with us. But not everyone will or can agree to those terms. As a result, if you opt out of the “sale” of data, we will not be able to send data to some of our business partners. That may mean that, after you opt out, you may not receive all of the marketing and other information you are accustomed to receiving from us. In the extreme, if one of our critical partners cannot agree to the special contract language, and is considered a “third party”, it is possible that some features of our web site or other services may not work for you after you opt out. In addition, California law prevents us from asking you to “opt in” for a year after you “opt out.” We are allowed to tell you, however, if a specific transaction requires a transfer of data to a third party. We may alert you if a transaction requires a transfer to a third party so that you can opt in if you would like to continue with the transaction. Minors. We do not “sell” the data of people under 16, and do not intend to collect data related to people who are under 13. Exceptions to the opt out. The law creates several exceptions that are important for you to be aware of. We are allowed to transfer data to a “service provider” even if you opt out. The law does not consider that kind of transfer to be a “sale.” A service provider is a business that agrees not to use your information for any purpose other than providing the services specified in our contract. For example, we transfer data to business partners to provide data security and detect fraud. Those businesses are “service providers.” Even if you opt out, we will continue to transfer data to our service providers. We are also allowed to transfer your data to a third party where you direct the transfer or direct us to interact with the third party. For example, if you direct us to use a specific payment method to pay for your order, even if you have opted out, we will still transfer the data necessary to process your order. Collecting information and using it ourselves is not a “sale.” Opting out of the “sale” of your data does not prevent us from continuing to collect and process your personal information. You can learn more about how and why we collect personal information in our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy. The “opt out” only applies to “personal information.” This is information that is or is capable of being linked to you. That data is not “personal information.” Opting out will not limit our transfer of that data to third parties. Technical limitations on opt out. Please note that there are technical limits to our ability to identify data related to you and, if you opt out, to prevent the “sale” of that information to other parties. Where we can reasonably determine that information relates to you and you have opted out, we will not “sell” it to “third parties” (except as allowed by the law). However, we may not be able to determine that information relates to you. In that case, the information may be “sold” to a third party. Opting out is not unsubscribing. Opting out of the “sale” of personal information will not prevent you from receiving marketing messages from us. If you wish to unsubscribe from our emails, please follow the unsubscribe link in one of our emails. If you wish to unsubscribe from text messages, please follow the unsubscribe process for the program you opted into. HOW TO OPT OUT. If you would like to opt out of the “sale” of your data, you may email us at hello@perpay.com, or you may call us at (215) 834-4200. To use the email or phone number to opt out, you or your authorized representative will need to provide us the email address you wish to opt out. We will then send a message to that address. You must reply from that email address to complete the process. This extra step is to authenticate you and prevent fraud and abuse. If you want multiple email addresses opted out, you must provide each address to us. This is because we have no reasonable way to use a single address you give us to link to other addresses you may have. MORE ON PRIVACY. We take the security and privacy of your data very seriously. If you would like to learn more about it, please read our Privacy Policy at https://www.perpay.com/privacy.

Order Acceptance: Each part of any order that you submit to Perpay constitutes an offer to purchase. If you do not receive a message from Perpay confirming receipt of your order, please contact our Customer Service department at hello@perpay.com before re-entering your order. Perpay’s confirmation of receipt of your order does not constitute Perpay's acceptance of your order. Perpay is only deemed to have accepted your order once the product(s) you ordered (the “Product(s)”) have been shipped. To make an order through the Services, you must be enrolled in Perpay’s payroll direct deposit program. Order Issues: Perpay reserves the right to deny any order for any reason, including if: (i) we discover an error in pricing and/or other information about the Product or receive insufficient or erroneous payment or shipping information, (ii) we suspect or it otherwise appears an order or associated payment may be connected to fraud, (iii) the Product is unavailable due to discontinuance or otherwise, (iv) you do not meet the eligibility requirements for use of the Services, or (v) you have exceeded your spending limit (vi) you have missed payments or made late payments in the past for a Perpay order. Returns: Please refer to our Return Policy found at: https://help.perpay.com/en/articles/108745-how-do-i-return-my-item if you would like to return any Product you purchased through the Services. Please note that the return policy varies by Product and not all Products are available for return. Please consult our Shipping and Return Policy for further details. Some items may be subject to a shipping and restocking fee. Damage claims must be submitted within 24-48 business hours of delivery, please inspect your order once it has arrived. Order Cancellation: If any Product is discontinued or otherwise becomes unavailable, Perpay reserves the right to cancel your order and provide you a credit for the amount paid for the Product. Restrictions on Resale: To protect the intellectual property rights of Perpay and its licensors and suppliers, to the extent permitted by law, any resale of Products for personal and/or business profit is strictly prohibited. Perpay reserves the right to decline any order that we deem to possess characteristics of reselling. Shipping: All items are prepared for shipment after your payment(s) via payroll direct deposit has been made on your scheduled payday. Risk of loss and title to items purchased from Perpay passes to the purchaser upon our delivery to the shipper. Depending upon your Product(s), shipments may be made in multiple packages and may be delivered on different dates. You will typically receive an email with tracking numbers within 3-5 business days of your first successful payment via payroll direct deposit, with the exception of furniture, mattresses, large TV's & other large appliances. These items are delivered via freight shipping and will require delivery to be scheduled with you directly. Please be advised it will take longer to generate tracking on freight delivery items. Items shipped via freight delivery (see individual product delivery details), in addition to all Ashley Furniture products, are unavailable to ship to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico Shipping surcharges may apply, but are not limited to, small parcel orders shipping to US territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Customers are not authorized to alter shipper delivery instructions in any way. If altered, Perpay Parties (as defined herein) and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss, claim, liability, or damage of any kind (“Loss”). This includes, but is not limited to, UPS My Choice. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Perpay Parties and the carrier from all Loss arising from or relating to the alterations of the delivery instructions. Perpay uses a third-party service provider for fulfilling orders. By ordering any Product through the Services, you acknowledge that Perpay has no responsibility or liability for any delays that may result from orders handled by such third-party service provider. Perpay Parties and the shipment carrier shall not be liable to you for any Loss, including but not limited to direct, indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages, whether based on contract or otherwise arising out of, or resulting from, UPS's provision of, or failure to provide, shipping service, including by following consignee instructions, failure to follow consignee instructions, delivery pursuant or contrary to consignee's instructions, misdelivery, or delayed delivery. By selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, you authorize the carrier to release packages addressed to you at your address when no one is present to receive the delivery and you will be asked and are required to accept responsibility for any loss or damage to the package after it has been released at the address. In no event shall Perpay Parties or the carrier be liable for any Loss, including but not limited to those arising out of, or resulting from loss, theft, alteration of, unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, your personal information, or other security breach, compromise, or incident involving your personal information, whether by third parties or otherwise, arising out of or resulting from the release of packages pursuant to the Authorized Shipment Release. Fees and Purchase Terms
Assessment of Spending Limit: Your “Approved Spending Limit” is the total dollar amount you may use towards purchases made through the Services. Your “Available Spending Limit” is your Approved Spending Limit minus any outstanding balances you have on your Account. Perpay may provide an estimated spending limit as a guide when placing your first order. Perpay reserves the right to change your spending limits at any time for any reason, including without limitation, your past payment history with Perpay or changes to your Account information. Promise to Pay:Each time you purchase a Product, you promise that you have the current intention and, to the best of your knowledge, you have the current ability to pay the full Perpay Purchase Price for the Product in accordance with the Perpay Payment Schedule. Absent a violation of this representation, you are not legally obligated to continue making payments. Accordingly, you do not “owe” us anything and, if you lose your job, have a medical emergency, encounter other unexpected financial difficulties you may cease making payments without legal liability to us. Of course, we ask you to do your best to resume payments when you can and will not approve further Product purchases while any scheduled payment under the Perpay Payment Schedule remains past due. Additionally, if you have enrolled in Perpay Plus and we are reporting your performance to one or more credit bureaus, we may report your failure to make all scheduled payments to one or more consumer reporting agencies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that your credit report may reflect late payments or missed payments. Additional Fees: Perpay will not charge any additional fees as result of missed or late payments. ACH/Credit/Debit Card Payment Authorization: In the event that you are unable to make payments through payroll direct deposit for an existing order(s), Perpay can charge your bank account (ACH), credit card or debit card (a “backup payment method”) on your behalf to satisfy your outstanding balance for an existing order(s). Payments made through a backup payment method can be made on a one-time or automatic recurring basis. Perpay will not make one-time or recurring charges using a backup payment method on your behalf without receiving your consent. A backup payment method can only be used to satisfy an outstanding balance for an existing order(s), you will not be able to move forward with a new order(s) until you are able to resume making payments through payroll direct deposit. The Backup Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated backup payment method, and you must refer to that agreement, not this Agreement, to determine your rights and liabilities. Perpay uses Stripe, Inc. as a third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services). By making payments via the Services, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s US Terms of Services available at: https://stripe.com/us/terms and Privacy Policy available at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.

We have put this Arbitration Clause (“Clause”) in question and answer form to make it easier to understand. However, this Clause is part of the Terms and Conditions and is legally binding. Background and Scope.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What is arbitration?	An alternative to a court case	In arbitration, a third party arbitrator (“TPA”) resolves “Claims” (as defined below) in a hearing. It is less formal than a court case.
Is it different from court and jury trials?	Yes	The hearing is private. There is no jury. It is usually less formal, faster and less expensive than a lawsuit. Pre-hearing fact finding (called “discovery”) is limited. Appeals are limited. Courts rarely overturn arbitration awards.
Can you opt-out of this Clause?	Yes, within 60 days	If you do not want this Clause to apply, you must send us a signed notice within 60 calendar days after you first use the Communication Facilities. You must send the notice by mail to Perpay Inc, 2400 Market Street, Suite 300, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103 (the “Notice Address”), Attn. “Arbitration Opt-Out.”
What is this Clause about?	The parties' agreement to arbitrate Claims	Unless you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such a member, protected by the Military Lending Act (a “Covered Consumer”) or unless you opt out, you and we agree that any party may elect to arbitrate or require arbitration of any "Claim" as defined below.
Who does the Clause cover?	You, us and certain "Related Parties"	This Clause governs you, us and our “Related Parties": (1) our parents, subsidiaries and affiliates; (2) employees, directors, officers, shareholders, members and representatives of ours or such other entities; and (3) any person or company (including Pinwheel) that is involved in a Claim you pursue at the same time you pursue a related Claim against us. However, this Clause does not apply if you are a Covered Consumer.
What Claims does the Clause cover?	All Claims (except certain Claims about this Clause)	This Clause governs all “Claims” that would usually be decided in court and are between you and us (or any Related Party). In this Clause, the word “Claims” has the broadest reasonable meaning. It includes contract and tort (including intentional tort) claims and claims under constitutions, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations. It includes all claims even indirectly related to the Communication Facilities, any Product, and purchase or our relationship with you. It includes claims related to collections, privacy and customer information. It includes claims related to the validity in general of the Agreement. However, it does not include Claims about the validity, coverage or scope of this Clause or any part of this Clause. All such Claims are for a court and not the TPA to decide.
Who handles the arbitration?	Usually AAA or JAMS	Arbitrations are conducted under this Clause and the rules of the arbitration company in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. However, arbitration rules that conflict with this Clause do not apply. The arbitration company will be either:
The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org.
JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018,www.jamsadr.com.
Any other company picked by agreement of the parties.
If all the above options are unavailable, a court will pick the arbitration company. No arbitration brought on a class basis may be administered without our consent by any arbitration company that would permit class arbitration under this Clause. The TPA will be selected under the arbitration company's rules. However, the arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge unless you and we otherwise agree.
Can Claims be brought in court?	Sometimes	You or we may bring a lawsuit if the other party does not demand arbitration. We will not demand arbitration of any lawsuit you bring as an individual action in small-claims court. However, we may demand arbitration of any appeal of a small-claims decision or any small-claims action brought on a class basis.
Are you giving up any rights?	Yes	For Claims subject to this Clause, you give up your right to:
Have juries decide Claims.
Have courts, other than small-claims courts, decide Claims.
Serve as a private attorney general or in a representative capacity.
Join a Claim you have with a Claim by other consumers.
Bring or be a class member in a class action or class arbitration.
We also give up the right to a jury trial and to have courts decide Claims you wish to arbitrate.
Can you or another consumer start class arbitration?	No	The TPA is not allowed to handle any Claim on a class or representative basis. All Claims subject to this Clause must be decided in an individual arbitration or an individual small-claims action. This Clause will be void if a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal.
What happens if part of this Clause cannot be enforced?	It depends.	If any portion of this Clause cannot be enforced, the rest of this Clause will continue to apply, except that:
If a court rules that the TPA can decide a Claim on a class or other representative basis and the court's ruling is not reversed on appeal, only this sentence will apply and the remainder of this Clause will be void. AND
If a party brings a Claim seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in this Clause prohibiting the TPA from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such Claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court and any individual Claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties agree to request that the court stay the Claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court.
In no event will a Claim for class relief or public injunctive relief be arbitrated.
What law applies?	The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)	This Agreement involves interstate commerce. Thus, the FAA governs this Clause. The TPA must apply substantive law consistent with the FAA. The TPA must honor statutes of limitation and privilege rights. Punitive damages are governed by the constitutional standards that apply in judicial proceedings.
Will anything you do make this Clause ineffective?	No	This Clause stays in force even if: (1) any or all of the Agreements are ended; or (2) we transfer or assign our rights under any or all of the Agreements.
Process.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?	Send a written Claim Notice and work to resolve the Claim	Before starting a lawsuit or arbitration, the Claimant must comply with Section 18 of this Agreement, captioned “Notice and Cure.”
How does arbitration start?	Mailing a notice	If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 30 days after notice of the Claim is received, the Claimant may start a lawsuit or arbitration, subject to the terms of this Clause. To start arbitration, the Claimant picks the arbitration company and follows the arbitration company's rules. If one party starts or threatens a lawsuit, the other party can demand arbitration. This demand can be made in court papers. It can be made if a party starts a lawsuit on an individual basis and then tries to pursue a class action. Once an arbitration demand is made, no lawsuit can be brought and any existing lawsuit must stop.
Will any hearing be held nearby?	Yes	The TPA may decide that an in-person hearing is unnecessary and that he or she can resolve a Claim based on written filings and/or a conference call. However, any in-person arbitration hearing must be held at a place reasonably convenient to you.
What about appeals?	Very limited	Appeal rights under the FAA are very limited. The TPA's decision will be final and binding, except for any FAA appeal right. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award.
Do arbitration awards affect other disputes?	No	No arbitration award involving the parties will have any impact as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor will an arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have any impact in an arbitration between the parties to this Clause.
Arbitration Fees and Awards.
Question	Short Answer	Further Detail
Who bears arbitration fees?	Usually, we do	We will pay all filing, administrative, hearing and TPA fees if you act in good faith, cannot get a waiver of such fees and ask us to pay.
When will we cover your legal fees and costs?	If you win	If you win an arbitration, we will pay your reasonable fees and costs for attorneys, experts and witnesses. We will also pay these amounts if required under applicable law or the arbitration company's rules or if payment is required to enforce this Clause. The TPA shall not limit his or her award of these amounts because your Claim is for a small amount.
Will you ever owe us for arbitration or attorneys' fees?	Only for bad faith	The TPA can require you to pay fees incurred by us if (and only if): (1) the TPA finds that you have acted in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); and (2) this power does not make this Clause invalid.
Can a failure to resolve a Claim informally result in a larger recovery for you?	Yes	You are entitled to an arbitration award of at least $5,000 if: (1) you give us notice of a Claim on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) and comply with all of the requirements of this Clause (including the requirements described in response to the question reading "What must a party do before starting a lawsuit or arbitration?)"; and (2) the TPA awards you money damages greater than the last amount you requested at least ten days before the arbitration commenced. This is in addition to the attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) to which you are otherwise entitled. This $5,000 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims you have raised or could have raised in the arbitration. Multiple awards of $5,000 are not contemplated by this Clause. Settlement demands and offers are strictly confidential. They may not be used in any proceeding by either party except to justify a minimum recovery of $5,000.
Can an award be explained?	Yes	A party may request details from the TPA, within 14 days of the ruling. Upon such request, the TPA will explain the ruling in writing.
