If we learn of a data breach that is likely to affect the security of your personal data, we may attempt to notify you electronically via email so that you can take appropriate protective steps and/or by posting a notice via the Services if a data breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

When retention is necessary, we will de-identify such personal data to the extent reasonably possible.
When retention is no longer needed to fulfill the processing purposes, your personal data is deleted from our records.
