Questions & Answers about Privacy Policies
Is A Privacy Policy Necessary?
In a word, absolutely. A privacy policy isn't just about telling your users what they can expected from your website, products, and services. It's about protecting you against potential liabilities that could arise from those aspects. It doesn't even have to be the users that go after you but also government agencies since they can be real sticklers for details.
More than the actual consequences of not having a privacy policy, it also helps to legitimize your website's authority if you have one. It just comes parts and parcel with having a successful online business.
What's A Privacy Policy Template?
For the most part, a privacy policy template is just what it sounds like. It's a template that was already made by somebody else and that you can use for your own website if you wanted to. This is incredibly helpful because creating a privacy policy from scratch can be a troublesome affair if you have no legal training. You would have to commission the help of a lawyer in order to do it right.
If your website is aiming for legitimacy, you definitely don't want to take this issue lightly. You can easily get in trouble with your customers and with the law if you don't have a privacy policy or if you have a bad one.
How Can I Use A Privacy Policy?
Usually, privacy policy templates are pretty straightforward. You can get one from a reputable source, copy the template and then paste it on your privacy page. Many of the relevant details will either be left blank or will need to be replaced. Either way, you need to be careful about the information that you put in the page.
You want to focus on company name or website name, the name of the site owner, company CEO, or web manager, and a few important details about purchases, service charges, and so on. Other than a few tweaks, a good template won't require much from you.

What is a privacy policy?
A privacy policy is a legal document that informs individuals about how an organization/individual collects, uses, discloses, and manages their personal data. It outlines the ways in which personal information is handled, including details about data collection, storage, and sharing practices. Essentially, it provides transparency to users regarding their privacy rights and how their data is treated.
What is personal data?
Personal data refers to any information related to an identified or identifiable living individual. It encompasses various identifiers, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, IP addresses, and more. Essentially, any data that can be used to identify a specific person falls under the category of personal data.
Why is a privacy policy important?
A privacy policy is a critical component of any Service Provider's online presence, as it outlines the handling and protection of sensitive customer information. It establishes trust between the service provider and its customers, demonstrating a commitment to protecting their personal data. A well-crafted privacy policy can help prevent legal liabilities and reputational damages, while also providing transparency and clarity on how customer information is collected, used, and shared. By having a comprehensive privacy policy in place, organizations can maintain a competitive advantage, build customer loyalty, and foster a positive brand image.
Is it safe to use a privacy policy template?
Yes, using a privacy policy template is generally safe and efficient. Templates are designed to align with data protection laws, ensuring compliance. However, it's essential to customize the template to accurately reflect your specific practices and business context. Always review and tailor the template to suit your needs.
What are terms and condition?
Terms and conditions are a critical component of contractual agreements, ensuring that all parties have a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities. These terms are incorporated into a legally binding agreement, adhering to relevant local, state, and federal laws. They establish essential boundaries that all parties must adhere to, providing clarity on acceptable and prohibited platform usage, managing user expectations, and outlining procedures for account termination and suspension. Additionally, these terms specify the governing laws applicable to the contract, provide mechanisms for dispute resolution, and address necessary disclaimers or warranties as required by law. By incorporating these terms into a legal agreement, businesses and customers can ensure they are fully informed of their rights and obligations, promoting a mutually beneficial relationship.
Why is this Privacy Policy Generator free?
This project was built out of a need for a free and open source Privacy Policy Generator for my Android applications.
Most such products online are pay walled or find ways to extract money from indie devs 
like me. I built this for myself first, but eventually saw how it was useful for a lot of
people. Today this webapp is used by people from all over the world, and I hope it will continue to be so.

6. Newsletter
Newsletter data
If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on this website, we will need from you an e-mail address as well as information that allow us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and consent to the receipt of the newsletter. No further data shall be collected or shall be collected only on a voluntary basis. We shall use such data only for the sending of the requested information and shall not share such data with any third parties.
The processing of the information entered into the newsletter subscription form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the archiving of data, the e-mail address and the use of this information for the sending of the newsletter at any time, for instance by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place to date.
The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.
After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite.
You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.
ConvertKit - Newsletter service provider
For sending our newsletter we use ConvertKit LLC (convertkit.com).
ConvertKit is a service that allows you to organize and analyze the sending of newsletters. The data you enter to subscribe to the newsletter will be processed on ConvertKit's servers in the U.S.A. and stored in accordance with European data protection regulations.
ConvertKit complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively referred to as "Privacy Shield") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union ("EU"), the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Switzerland, and the United States.
Statistical survey and analyses
For analysis purposes, e-mails sent with ConvertKit contain a so-called "tracking pixel" that connects to ConvertKit's servers when the e-mail is opened. This way it can be determined if a newsletter message has been opened.
Furthermore, we can use ConvertKit to determine if and which links in the newsletter message are clicked. All links in the email are so-called tracking links, which can be used to count your clicks.
A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled.
Legal basis
The use of the newsletter service provider, the execution of the statistical surveys and analyses as well as the logging of the registration procedure are based on my legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 letter f DSGVO. I am interested in the use of a user friendly and secure newsletter system that serves my business interests and meets the expectations of the users.
