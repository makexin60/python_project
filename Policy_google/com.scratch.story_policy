Introduction
This FunFamApps privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to the personal data that we collect from you when you use our website http://funfamapps.com (the “Website”) and our mobile applications named Tot Tiles, Scratch Story, Letters Catch and Hue Land (collectively, “ the Apps”).
We value your privacy and want to be clear about the personal data we collect and how it’s used. Here’s a straightforward overview:
What We Collect: When using our apps, we might ask for personal data like your name and email. Rest assured, we only gather what we absolutely need for you to enjoy FunFamApps.
Why We Need It: Your information helps us improve your app experience, provide effective customer support, and ensure the security and functionality of our services.
Our Promise: We only use your data for the purposes we’ve shared with you here. We won’t repurpose your data for anything else, sticking strictly to the reasons you gave it to us.
Legal Basis: Our use of your personal data is based on your consent, our need to fulfill our service commitments to you, and our obligation to meet legal standards.
Your trust is important to us. We’re committed to keeping your personal data safe and used only in ways that improve your experience with FunFamApps.
Definitions
‘NON-PERSONAL DATA’ is information that is in no way personally identifiable.
PERSONAL DATA’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’), such as the data subject’s name, identification number, location data, or an online identifier. Personal data is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, personal data is broader in scope and covers more data than PII.
‘GDPR’ means the EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679).
‘CCPA’ means the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.
Personal data collected through the Apps
When you use the Apps, we collect your email address, name, and age. We use such data for the following purposes:
To validate your age;
To store your game progress;
To register and maintain your user account;
To allow you to play from multiple devices;
To send promotional emails (if you consent to them); and
To reply to your support emails, if you send us any.
We keep the data listed above until you stop using the Apps (e.g., uninstall the Apps).
In addition, we automatically collect certain information that is later used for re-engagement and re-attribution purposes. Please note that, although certain information (like your device ID) may be considered by certain laws personal data, such technical data does not allow us to identify you as an individual by any means and we do not intend to do so. The types of technical information that we automatically collect through the Apps are mentioned below:
Timestamps telling us when you install or first launch the App;
Information about how you use the App;
Your device ID;
The URLs that you click on before accessing the App or later;
Information sent by self-reporting networks like Facebook, Snapchat, and Google Ads;
The ads that you click on or view; and
Your other online behavior data.
We use the technical information listed above to analyze your use of the Apps, find out how you find the Apps, examine the reasons that encourage you to install or delete the Apps, and track your online behavior. We keep such data as long as it is necessary for its purposes, but no longer than 1 year.
The legal bases that we rely on when collecting and using your personal data are “performing a contract with you,” “your consent” (for promotional emails, marketing and advertising), and “pursuing our legitimate business interests” (i.e., to ensure the security of the Apps and our compliance with the applicable laws, as well as to analyze and grow the Apps).
Analytics Data
When you use the Apps downloaded from Apple Apps Store or Google Play Store, we use our third-party analytics service provider Firebase (
https://firebase.google.com
) offered by Google, which automatically collects the following technical personal and non-personal data from you:
IP address;
Number of sessions;
Session duration;
Retention;
Events;
Install source; and
IDFA.
We use such data to:
Analyse the technical aspects of your use of the Apps;
Optimise the Apps for your needs;
Prevent fraud and abuse of the Apps;
Ensure the security of the Apps; and
Serve you relevant ads.
We keep such data as long as it is necessary for its purposes, but no longer than 1 year.  The legal bases that we rely on when processing the above-mentioned data are “pursuing our legitimate business interests” (i.e., to analyse, grow, and protect KLA) and “your consent”.
Contact with us
When you contact us by email or by using the contact form available on the Website, we collect your name, email address, and any information that you decide to provide us in your message. We use your personal data to respond to your inquiries and provide you with the requested information. The legal bases that we rely on when processing such personal data are “pursuing our legitimate business interests” (i.e., to grow and promote FunFamApps) and “your consent” (for optional personal data that you decide, at your sole discretion, to provide us). We keep such data until you stop communicating with us.

Sharing Information with Affiliates and Other Third Parties
We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes. We may give your personal data to third-party service providers we hire to provide services on our behalf (data processors).
The disclosure of your personal data is limited to the situations when it is required for the following purposes:
Ensuring the proper operation of FunFamApps;
Delivering you the requested services;
Responding to your enquiries;
Pursuing our legitimate interests;
Enforcing our rights, preventing fraud, and security purposes;
Carrying out our contractual obligations;
Law enforcement purposes; or
If you provide your prior consent to such a disclosure.
Your non-personal data may be disclosed to third parties for any purpose as it does not identify you as a natural person. For example, we may share it with prospects or partners for business or research purposes, for improving FunFamApps, responding to lawful requests from public authorities or developing new products and services.
Legally Required Releases of Information
We may be legally required to disclose your personal data if such disclosure is (a) required by subpoena, law, or other legal process; (b) necessary to assist law enforcement officials or governmental enforcement agencies; (c) necessary to investigate violations of or otherwise enforce our terms and conditions; (d) necessary to protect us from legal action or claims from third parties, including you and/or other users; or (e) necessary to protect the legal rights, personal/real property, or personal safety of our company, users, employees, and affiliates.
Retaining and Destroying Your Personal Data
We retain information that we collect from you (including your personal data) only for as long as we need it for its intended purposes or other legal or business purposes (if we have a legal basis to keep it). Your information may be retained in electronic, paper, or a combination of both forms. When your information is no longer needed, we will securely destroy, delete, or erase it. We retain non-personal data pertaining to you for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This may include storing non-personal data for the period of time needed for us to examine our activities, fulfill our contractual obligations, pursue our legitimate interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
Links to Other Websites
FunFamApps may contain links to other websites. These websites are not under our control and are not subject to our Privacy Policy. These websites will likely have their own privacy policies. We have no responsibility for these websites and we provide links to these websites solely for your convenience. You acknowledge that your use of and access to these websites are solely at your risk. It is your responsibility to check the privacy policies of these websites to see how they treat your personal data.
Protecting Children’s Privacy
Parts of FunFamApps, such as the Apps, are designed for the use by children. We have limited the collection of personal data from children to the bare minimum. We do not collect personal data from children who are under the age to provide their personal data or who cannot provide their valid consent under the COPPA or GDPR. We realize that a child who is under the age to provide valid consent may try to access FunFamApps and provide consent where it is required (e.g., for our use of non-essential cookies). Therefore, we ask all app users to specify their age. We do not ask children under the age that requires parental consent (e.g., in the US – 13, in the EU – 16) to provide their personal data. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided his or her personal data without your consent, please contact us. Before we remove any information, we may ask for proof of identification to prevent malicious removal of information. If we discover that a child has provided us with personal data without parental consent, we will delete his or her information as soon as possible.
Security Policy
We have built FunFamApps using industry-standard security measures and authentication tools to protect the security of your personal data. We and the third parties who provide services to us also maintain technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal data. Our security measures include secured networks, SSL protocol, strong passwords, limited access to your personal data by our staff, and anonymization of personal data (when possible).
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the prevention of loss or misuse of your personal data or secure data transmission over the Internet because of its nature. We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for FunFamApps and not share it with anyone.
Transferring Personal Data from the EEA
The personal data that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred among any countries in which we or our data processors operate. The European Union has not found the United States and some other countries to have an adequate level of protection of personal data under Article 45 of the GDPR. We rely on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. In case it is necessary to make a transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will make sure that the country in which the recipient third party is located guarantees an adequate level of protection for your personal data or we conclude an agreement with the respective third party that ensures such protection (e.g., a data processing agreement based on pre-approved standard contractual clauses).
Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post changes on the Website and the Apps so that you are always aware of what personal data we collect, use, and disclose. If we have your email address, we will send you a notice about the changes implemented by us.
