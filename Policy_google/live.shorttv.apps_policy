1. Types of Personal Data We Collect
Our primary objective in gathering your personal information is to facilitate a more efficient and enjoyable
      experience for you and other users when utilizing our products and services. We strive to create a secure and
      engaging online environment for all users, and the collection of information aids us in achieving this aim. While
      using the Services, we may gather and process details that could be directly or indirectly linked to your personal
      identity. In either scenario, such details may be considered personal data under this Policy.
Information not directly tied to your personal identity: For instance, we may collect and process data about the
      user's source route, access sequence, and other information, such as tracking the source route and browser
      software of each user.
Please be aware that if you share or post information in a public area visible to other users of the Service, and
      you reveal your personal information in response to information shared or posted by others, such information may
      be collected and utilized by others. If you discover that other users have improperly collected or used your or
      others' information, please contact us as directed in Section 10 "How to Contact Us."

      service.
Please note that other users may collect and use your information if you upload, post, or make your information
      public in an area where other users can see or respond to it. If you find that other users have improperly
      collected or used your or others' information, please contact us as outlined in Section 10 "How to Contact Us"
      below.
Information shared by other users about you, or information about you provided by other users when using the
      service.
Information we obtain about you, such as log information, location information, and device information, which we
      collect, aggregate, and record when you use the Services.
We collect and use your information for purposes such as:
Assisting you with registration and login: To provide you with our services, you need to supply basic
      registration or login information, such as mobile phone number (sensitive personal information), verification code
      matching result (sensitive personal information), nickname, gender, date of birth, and profile picture, to create
      an account (username and password).
You may also use a third-party platform account supported by us to log in to ShortMax; in this case, we will
      obtain relevant information (such as your nickname, profile photo) from the third-party account as per your
      authorization.
Thus, the aforementioned personal data provided by you or obtained by us from your third-party platform account
      with your consent will be used for these purposes to provide and perform services for you in line with our
      agreement. Without this personal data, we cannot offer our services, and you will not be able to log in or use
      ShortMax.
Providing Search Services
When utilizing the search function in ShortMax, we collect your search terms, browsing history, browsing
      duration, and interaction frequency. This information helps us deliver the content you need and services that may
      interest you more.
Offering Recharge and Inquiry Services
When you recharge (acquire gold coins in ShortMax), we will collect details about your order and payment account.
      If you check the remaining value of your virtual property in your user account, we will collect and display it on
      the relevant page. Please note that information about your recharge, order, account, and virtual property is
      sensitive, so provide and use it with caution.
Providing Calendar-Based Recording and Reminder Services
We will only list your schedule in your calendar and provide recording and reminder services after you grant us
      access to your calendar.
Ensuring Account Security, Service Operation, and Optimizing Service Experience
When using this service, to help us detect account anomalies, understand product suitability, provide basic
      services (such as browsing, search), and maintain the smooth operation of basic functions, we may automatically
      collect, store, and process information about your service usage and how you use it, including:
(1) Log Details: When utilizing this service, we may automatically gather comprehensive information about your
      usage and save it as relevant network logs. This log information includes your login account, search queries, IP
      Address, browser type, telecom provider, network environment, language, access date and time, and records such as
      total page views, push open records, time spent on the page, refresh records, post records, follow and subscribe

To collect the above personal basic device information, we will request permission to access your device
      information. We gather this information to offer you our fundamental services and functions. If you decline to
      grant such permission, you may be unable to use the service.
Please recognize that device information and/or log information alone cannot identify a specific individual, so
      this information itself is considered non-personal. However, if such non-personal information is combined with
      other information to identify a specific individual or with other personal information, it will be regarded as
      personal information during that combination. In such cases, it will be treated as personal information and
      protected according to this policy. Unless authorized by you or otherwise stipulated by applicable laws and
      regulations, such personal information will be anonymized and de-identified.
Offering Client Server or User Response Services
When you reach out to us for Client Server or user responses (such as inquiries, feedback, suggestions,
      complaints, etc.), we may request necessary personal information to match and verify your user identity, ensuring
      the security of your account and system. We may store details like your communication/call records, conversations,
      or contact information to reach you or assist in resolving issues, or to record the solutions and outcomes of
      related problems. Therefore, we process your personal data for these purposes in accordance with our agreement
      with you. This personal data may also be processed to protect your legitimate interests, namely to obtain relevant
      information about your services and other related data from ShortMax.
Providing Information Display and Recommendation Services
We may use your information (such as interests, personalized tags, browsing and search history, device
      information, usage habits, location information, order information, etc.) and combine it to extract your browsing,
      search preferences, behavior patterns, and location information through recommendation algorithm modeling,
      programming, advertising models, user behavior analysis, and user profiling. This enables us to offer page
      displays and personalized content recommendations that better suit your needs.
Sending Notifications to You
We may send you service-related notices when necessary (e.g., when we suspend individual services due to system
      maintenance). If you wish to stop receiving messages from us, you can request that we cease sending them. However,
      we may continue to send messages in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Enhancing Our Services
We may invite you to participate in service-related surveys to help us improve existing services or design new
      ones; simultaneously, we may use your information for software updates. Therefore, to maintain our legitimate
      interest in enhancing our services, we will process this personal data for this purpose.
Other Uses of Anonymous Information
You understand and agree that in certain cases, after collecting your information, we will de-identify and fully
      anonymize the data through technical means, so it no longer constitutes personal data directly or indirectly
      related to you or others. The de-identified information does not identify or relate to you. In this case, we
      reserve the right to use such de-identified information for analysis and monetization of the user database.
If we intend to use your information for purposes not outlined in this Policy, we will seek your prior consent
      through page prompts, interactive processes, website announcements, or other means. Once you agree, such
      additional use of your information will be considered part of and subject to this Policy.

(2) With your consent, we can access your device information, using it as your device's unique identifier to
      provide you with more personalized recommendations, understand product applicability, identify irregularities, and
      ensure network and service security.
Concerning permissions to access albums/cameras, contact lists, microphones, locations, calendars (including
      reading and writing), most mobile devices will allow you to revoke any permissions. For details, please refer to
      or contact your mobile device's service provider or manufacturer. When you grant us any permissions, you authorize
      us to collect and use relevant information to provide you with corresponding services. Once you revoke any
      permissions, your authorization will cease, and we will no longer continue to collect and use relevant
      information, nor provide you with corresponding services. However, the collection and use of information
      previously made under your authorization will remain unaffected.
