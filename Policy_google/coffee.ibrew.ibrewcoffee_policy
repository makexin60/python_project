Privacy Policy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of users of the iBrewCoffee website, iBrewCoffee mobile application(s), and/or other related services (hereinafter collectively the “iBrewCoffee Services” or the “Services”).
In this Privacy Policy, “We”, “Us”, and “Our” refer to iBrewCoffee. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, iBrewCoffee is the “Data Controller” and ”Data Protection Officer” for all iBrewCoffee Services with respect to the Personal Data of visitors, users, clients, and customers (“You” or “Your”).
This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal and non-personal data We collect and how We use such data. It also describes Your choices regarding Our use of Your Personal Data and how You can access and update this information. This Privacy Policy is part of Our
Terms and Conditions
and applies to all iBrewCoffee Services. Therefore, please make sure that You read and understand Our Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms and Conditions.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they may be accessible through the iBrewCoffee Services.
By using any of the iBrewCoffee Services, You hereby warrant and represent that:
You have read, understand, and agreed to be bound by this Privacy Policy,
You are over 16 years of age (or are a parent or guardian with such authority to agree to this Privacy Policy for the benefit of an individual under 16 years of age).
If You do not accept the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy and the consents associated therewith, please do not use Our Services.
Your Data
iBrewCoffee strives to provide You with the best possible service. In order to provide this service, We may need to collect information from You from time to time. At all times, We try to only collect the information We need for the particular function or activity We are carrying out and use it in accordance with this privacy policy.
We collect two basic types of information from You from Your use of the Services: Personal Data and Non-Personal Data.
Personal and non-personal data
The term “personal data” (hereinafter “Personal Data” or “Personal Information”) is defined by the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can think of Your personal data as any data that allow You to be identified or that can be correlated to you.
On the other hand, “non-personal” data cannot be correlated to any specific person. By removing identifiable parts from and anonymizing personal data, personal data may be converted into “non-personal data.”
Collection of personal data
We collect, process, and use three types of data:
data You provide to Us voluntarily,
data We receive when You use Our Services (create an account, publish content, make a purchase, fill any online forms, etc.), and
data We receive from third parties.
When required, this data may include the following:
Contact information such as e-mail address;
Personal details such as first and last name;
Account details such as username and password;
Your survey answers, critiques, evaluations, or other responses;
Connection details such as Your IP address, operating system, browser type, browser version, browser configuration, name of the Internet provider, and any other relevant information regarding Your computer and Internet connection in order to identify the type of Your device, to connect You to the website, to exchange data with Your (mobile) terminal device, or to ensure proper use of the website and an iBrewCoffee application;
Any other information input or uploaded by You through the Services (e.g., the information You provide when completing an online form, photos You upload, feedbacks You submit, etc.);
Or data We receive when You log in using an identity provider (e.g., if You log in with Facebook, Google, Apple ID, etc.) such as username, e-mail address, first and last name, and profile picture;
Login
You may create an iBrewCoffee user account through the means offered by the Services such as e-mail and password login, connect using a Facebook account, connect using Google account, and/or connect using Apple ID.
By using Our Services, You confirm that You have read Our Privacy Policy and accept Our
Terms and Conditions
.
Enabling access rights to Your device
For You to be able to use an iBrewCoffee application to the full extent, We will also need certain access rights to Your smartphone. For example, We need access to Your camera or Your photos if You want to attach a photo to a product. When You want to use such a function for the first time, We will ask You whether You grant Us such access rights, or We will ask You to grant Us access by selecting the appropriate settings. Generally, You may revoke such access rights at any time by changing the appropriate settings.
Newsletter
We offer electronic newsletters to which You may voluntarily subscribe at any time. That way, You will receive regular updates about the iBrewCoffee Services. All You need to receive Our newsletter is to provide Us with a valid e-mail address. We are committed to keeping Your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose Your e-mail address to any third parties except as allowed in the use and processing of personal data section or for the purposes of utilizing a third-party provider to send such e-mails.
In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from Us will clearly state who the e-mail is from and provide clear information on how to contact the sender. If You are no longer interested in receiving the newsletter, You may unsubscribe at any time using the link that is included in each newsletter. However, You will continue to receive essential transactional e-mails.
Website
You will also transfer certain information to Us when You access Our website or iBrewCoffee application(s), e.g., Your IP address. We will also receive data about which terminal device (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) You are using, which browser (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.) You are using, the time at which You access the website, the so-called referrer, and the data volume transferred. Such data cannot be used by Us to identify the user. This data is processed for statistical purposes only. Such analyses help Us make Our Services more attractive and, if necessary, to improve Our Services.
Log files
Every time You access Our website, the aforementioned data will be automatically stored in log files. A log file automatically logs all or defined actions on a computer system. Such log files are important, for example, for process control and automation. In the case of databases, a log file tracks changes to the database of correctly executed transactions. In the event of an error (e.g., a system crash), this allows the current dataset to be restored. Log files are also created by web servers. Inter alia, the following data are logged: the address of the accessing computer, authentication fields, date and time of access, access method, the content of HTML access, status code of the web server, and information about the browser and operating system used by the client.
Other possible instances of data collection
Collection of data also happens, for example, when You contact other users or us, i.e., when You open Your iBrewCoffee user account, sign up for a subscription, or use Our Services.
Legal bases for processing Your data
We will collect, process, and use Your personal data and other data to support the delivery of iBrewCoffee Services in accordance with Our

Some information We collect will be stored for longer where We have an overriding legitimate interest to retain such information (for example, information on suspicious behaviour of certain users of Our Services and transaction records). We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating Your data after You update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify You personally.
In some cases, it is not possible for Us to specify in advance the periods for which Your Personal Data will be retained. In such cases, We will determine the period of retention based on Our legitimate interests, namely the proper administration of Our Services. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, We may retain Your Personal Data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which We are subject, or in order to protect Your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

When deleting Information, We will take measures to make the Information irrecoverable or irreproducible, and electronic files which contain Information will be deleted permanently.
Data security
Although the transmission of Information via the internet is not completely secure, We strive to minimize this risk as much as possible. We may also take extra steps to protect Your Information and minimize the Information We process, and when We send or receive Your Information, it is encrypted with TLS 1.1 or above. Additionally, We are not responsible for how third party integration services may collect, use or share the Information You send from the Services.

Device Information
As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including
ads
) or features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device.
Information we obtain from these devices includes:

.
Cookie data:
data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the
Facebook Cookies Policy
and
Instagram Cookies Policy

Information from partners.
Advertisers,
app
developers, and publishers can send us information through
Meta Business Tools
they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our
APIs and SDKs
, or the Meta
pixel
. These partners provide information about your activities off of our Products—including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you have an account or are logged into our Products. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.
Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.

Facebook Cookies Policy

II. How do we use this information?
We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the Meta Products and related services described in the
Meta Terms
and
Instagram Terms
. Here's how:
Provide, personalize and improve our Products.
We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and content (including your ads,
Facebook News Feed
,
Instagram Feed
, and Instagram Stories) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or
events
you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and

ads

Information across Meta Products and devices:
We connect information about your activities on different Meta Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Meta Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product.
Location-related information:
We use
location-related information
-such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products,

Promote safety, integrity and security.
We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of Meta Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to
detect when someone needs help
. To learn more, visit the
Facebook Security Help Center
and
Instagram Security Tips
.

to aid relief efforts.
Learn more
about our research programs.
III. How is this information shared?
Your information is shared with others in the following ways:
Sharing on Meta Products
People and accounts you share and communicate with
When you share and communicate using our Products,
you choose the audience for what you share
. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.
Public information
can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your
public profile on Facebook
; and content you share on a Facebook Page,
public Instagram account
or any other public forum, such as
Facebook Marketplace
. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Meta Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.
Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on
Facebook
and
Instagram
.
Content others share or reshare about you
You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as
Horizon Worlds
. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.
People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to
report the content
.
Information about your active status or presence on our Products.
People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on
Instagram
,
Messenger
or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.
Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.
When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.
Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.
Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.
New owner.
If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.
Sharing with Third-Party Partners
We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Meta Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:
Partners who use our analytics services.
We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Facebook Pages, videos and other content on and off the Meta Products. For example, Facebook Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their account or Facebook Page.
Advertisers.
We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.
Measurement partners.
We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.
Partners offering goods and services in our Products.
When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.
Vendors and service providers.
We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.
Researchers and academics.
We also provide information and content to research partners and
academics
to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.
Law enforcement or legal requests.
We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.
Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the
Facebook Settings
and
Instagram Settings
.
IV. How do the Meta Companies work together?
Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other
Meta Companies
(which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all
Meta Company Products
you use. We also process information about you across the Meta Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Meta Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Meta Company Products.
V. What is our legal basis for processing data?
We collect, use and share the data that we have in the ways described above:
as necessary to fulfill our
Meta Terms of Service
or
Instagram Terms of Use
;
consistent with your consent, which you may revoke at any time through the
Facebook Settings
and
Instagram Settings
;
as necessary to comply with our legal obligations
to protect your vital interests, or those of others;
as necessary in the public interest; and
as necessary for our (or others') legitimate interests, including our interests in providing an innovative, personalized, safe, and profitable service to our users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal data.
Learn more
about these legal bases and how they relate to the ways in which we process data.
VI. How can you exercise your rights provided under the GDPR?
Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to access, rectify, port and
erase
your data. Learn more about these rights, and find out how you can exercise your rights in the
Facebook Settings
and
Instagram Settings
. You also have the
right to object to
and restrict certain processing of your data. This includes:
the right to object to our processing of your data for direct marketing, which you can exercise by using the "unsubscribe" link in such marketing communications; and
the right to object to our processing of your data where we are performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party. You can exercise this right on Facebook and on Instagram.
VII. Data retention, account deactivation and deletion
We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Meta Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of
content you have shared
and
cookie data obtained through social plugins
.
When you delete your account, we
delete things
you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the
Facebook Settings
and
Instagram Settings
.
VIII. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?
We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:
In response to a legal request, if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. We can also respond to legal requests when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.
When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.
Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made on our Products) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.
IX. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?
We share information globally, both internally within the Meta Companies and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Information controlled by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the
Meta Terms
and
Instagram Terms
and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize
standard contractual clauses
approved by the European Commission and rely on the European Commission's
adequacy decisions
about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other countries.

14. Cookies
Amplitude uses cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. Below we describe what cookies and web beacons are, why we use cookies and web beacons, the types of cookies and web beacons that we use, as well as what you can do in order to manage and delete cookies and web beacons.
What are cookies and web beacons?
Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors to their websites. A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to our Website. Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. The cookies can be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies are stored by a web browser and remain valid until a set expiration date. Session cookies only exist while your internet browser is open and are automatically deleted once you close your browser.
Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic files contained on pages of websites that permit companies to count users who have visited certain webpages on a website and are used for other related website statistics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
What does Amplitude
use cookies and web beacons for?
Amplitude uses a variety of cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies for different purposes. Specifically, Amplitude uses cookies and web beacons to enhance the experience of our visitors to our Website (for example, by remembering your preferences and letting you navigate between pages efficiently) and to better understand how the Website and Product are used.

What types of cookies and web beacons are used by Amplitude?
Amplitude uses both first-party and third-party cookies and web beacons. First-party cookies and web beacons are cookies and web beacons that are served directly by Amplitude to your computer or mobile device. Third-party cookies and web beacons are served by a third-party service provider on behalf of Amplitude. Third-party cookies are most commonly used for advertising and analytics purposes.
There are four categories of cookies and web beacons used by Amplitude. Specifically, Amplitude uses essential, performance, functionality and advertising cookies and web beacons.
Essential cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies are necessary for the operation of the Website and Product. These tracking technologies enable you to move around on the Website and use the Website’s features. You may not opt-out of these types of cookies because they are required to operate the Website and Product.
Performance cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies collect information about how you have used the Website and Product. We use performance cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies to improve the user experience with our Website and Product.
Functionality cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies allow us to remember how you are logged into our Website, when you logged in or out and the actions you have taken while you have been logged into the Website.
Advertising cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies are used by our third-party service providers to deliver advertising to you on other third-party websites as well as help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. We also use these types of cookies to analyze Website visits and ad conversions from third-party websites.

What personal information does Sentry collect?
The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:
Information that you provide
We collect information about you when you input it into our Site or the Service or otherwise provide it directly to us.
Account and profile creation
We collect information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, and set preferences for the Service. For example, you may provide your contact information, including your first and last name, email address, and password when you register for the Service. You may also have the option of adding an avatar to your profile to be displayed in the Service. We keep track of your preferences when you select settings within the Service, including marketing and notification settings.
Sign in via other platforms
Instead of creating a user account, you can log in via your account with other platforms (currently Google, Github, or Azure Devops). We will not collect the password that you use for the relevant platform, but we may collect details from your account with the platform, such as username and email address.
Requests and inquiries
You may choose to provide us with information when you contact us about our Service or otherwise interact with us. For example, you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with our Service and send us screenshots to help in resolving the problem. You may submit your contact information to register for our events, to subscribe to receive marketing communications from us, or to make an inquiry through our Site. You may also provide content to us when you participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstake, activity, or event, including via social media and other content platforms.
Purchases
If you register for a paid Service, we will collect purchase information, such as the Service plan that you purchase and information related to refunds, credits, and cancellations, and your billing address and payment information. Please note that any payment information you provide is sent directly to a third-party payment processor. We have no access to and do not store your payment information.
Information that we collect from your device and usage
We collect certain information about your device and how you and your device interact with us and our Site or Service. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (together, ”
Europe
”), this information may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws.
Specifically, the information we collect will include information such as your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, operating system, software installed on your device, product keys, general location information (such as inferred from an IP address), and referring URL.  We also collect information about how you and your device have interacted with our Site or Service or with us via email, including the pages you accessed, features you used, Service you purchased, links you clicked, and when you accessed and for how long.
Some of this information is collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading
“Cookies and similar tracking technology”
below.
Information that we obtain from third-party sources
From time to time, we receive personal information about you from third-party sources (including social media and other content platforms, public databases, and from our business and channel partners and service providers).
The types of information we collect from third parties include name, email addresses, job titles, and social media profiles. We may combine this information with information we collect through other means described above. This helps us to maintain and improve the accuracy of our records, identify new customers, deliver personalized communications, and suggest services that may be of interest to you.
Return to top
What does Sentry use my personal information for?
We use your information for business and commercial purposes, such as to:
Provide, maintain, and improve the Site and Service, including system administration, system security, and adding new features or capabilities;
Manage your account and send you related information, including confirmations, updates, technical notices, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
Respond to your comments, questions, and requests, and provide customer care and support services;
Communicate with you about the Service, products, offers, surveys, events, content, and other news and information we think may be of interest to you;
Monitor and analyse trends, usage, and activities in connection with the Site and Service and our communications to you;
Detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, protect the rights and property of Sentry and others, and comply with legal requirements;
Personalize and improve the Site and Service and provide advertisements, content, and features that match your profile and interests, and remember information about your preferences for the Site and Service;
Administer surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, and other activities; and
Carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected.
We may aggregate or de-identify information collected through the Service. We may use aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any third parties, including without limitation, advertisers, promotional partners, sponsors, event promoters, and others.
Return to top
Legal basis for processing personal information
If you are based in Europe, we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable European laws. This means we collect and process your information only where:
We need it to provide the Site or Service, including to register you as a new user, operate the Site or Service, provide technical support, and to protect the safety and security of the Site or Service;
It satisfies our legitimate interests, such as to market and promote the Service and to protect our legal rights and interests, which are not overridden by your own interests, rights, and freedoms;
It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or in connection with a legal claim, such as to respond to judicial orders or subpoenas; or
You provide consent for a specific purpose, such as for marketing communications (where consent is required under applicable marketing laws).
The legal bases depend on the type of information and the purpose for our processing. In some contexts, more than one legal basis applies. When we process your information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on such consent before it is withdrawn. To exercise your rights, see
“Your data protection rights”
below. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g., your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Service.
Return to top
Who does Sentry disclose my personal information to?
We disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
Affiliate companies
who help operate and improve our Site and Service (including to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Site and Service), offer other Sentry affiliated services to you, or who otherwise process personal information for the purposes described in this policy. The protections of this policy apply to the information we disclose in these circumstances.
Third-party services providers
who provide hosting, storage, support, payment processing, billing, communication, analysis, and other services to us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access or use information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under appropriate security and confidentiality procedures designed to protect your information.
Third-party go-to-market partners
who provide referral, sale, resale, or similar go-to-market services. We may disclose your information, like your name, email address, and job title, in connection with their services. We may also disclose information to these third parties where you have agreed to that disclosure.
Third-party analytics partners
to provide analytics services. These entities may use Cookies in the same way we do, to among other things, track and analyze data, and better understand your online activity.
Third-party platforms
when you, your administrator or other Service users choose to install or enable third-party apps, add-ons or other platforms for use with the Service. Doing so may give the providers of those platforms access to your account and information about you, like your name and email address, and any content you choose to connect with those platforms. Please note that when you use third-party platforms, your use will be governed by their own terms and privacy policies.
Any
competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party
where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.
An
actual or potential buyer
(and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger, or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this policy.
Any
other person with your consent
to the disclosure.
Return to top
Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “
Cookies
”) to collect and use personal information about you, including to understand and save your preferences, and to compile aggregate data about Site and Service interaction.
We may also allow certain third parties (e.g., service providers such as Stripe) to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site or Service. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed, non-human-readable form.
You may refuse to accept Cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of Cookies. You can find information on popular browsers and how to adjust your Cookie preferences at the browser provider’s websites. You can choose to disable Cookies, but if you do, your ability to use or access certain parts of our Site and Service may be affected.
We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals.

How does Sentry keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet, or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. In particular, email sent to or from Sentry may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.
Return to top
International data transfers
In some cases your personal information is transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, our Site and Service are hosted in the United States and Germany, and our affiliate companies and third-party service providers operate around the world, including in the United States, Canada and Europe. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries.
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of Europe and Switzerland, which have been formally recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” from the European Commission and Swiss Federal Administration, and “adequacy regulations” from the Secretary of State in the United Kingdom.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this policy. The safeguards we use are the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses, the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, and other appropriate legal mechanisms. This is how transfers of personal information between our group companies and with our third-party service providers will be safeguarded.
Data Privacy Framework Notice
Functional Software, Inc. (our registered company name) participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the
“Data Privacy Framework”
) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information about you that is transferred from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the U.S.  We have self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles for all information about you that is received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. We have also self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (together with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles, the
“Data Privacy Framework Principles”
) for all information about you that is received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles will govern.
As required under the Data Privacy Framework, when we receive information under the Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Data Privacy Framework if the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We may be required to disclose information about you under the Data Privacy Framework in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view Sentry’s certification, please see the
Data Privacy Framework website
.
We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Data Privacy Framework-related (or general privacy-related) complaint and we commit to resolve any such complaint. We have further committed to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework to JAMS, a U.S.-based alternative dispute resolution provider.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your Data Privacy Framework-related complaint from us, or if you are not satisfied with our response to your Data Privacy Framework-related complaint, please visit
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the
Data Privacy Framework website
, including when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted, you may invoke binding arbitration.
We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Return to top
Data retention
We retain the personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (e.g., to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).  In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our relationship has ended. For example, we may retain your data for longer than the usual retention period when we have a legal obligation to do such, to deal with and resolve requests and complaints, to protect an individual’s rights and property, and for litigation and regulatory matters. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of any legal requirement. The criteria we use to determine the retention period include:
How long is the personal information needed to provide the Service or operate our business?
This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of the Service, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.
Is there an automated control, such as in your Sentry dashboard, that enables you to access and delete the personal information at any time?
If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.
Is the personal information of a sensitive type?
If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.
Has consent been provided for a longer retention period?
If so, we will retain the data in accordance with your consent.
Is Sentry subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data?
Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal reason to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (e.g., because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

TL;DR:
For plausible.io visitors, we do not use cookies and we do not collect any personal data. If you decide to create an account, we ask for the bare minimum and only share it with services that are absolutely necessary for the app to function.
At Plausible Analytics, we are committed to complying with GDPR, CCPA, PECR and other privacy regulations on our website and on our web analytics product too. The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us.
In this policy, we lay out what data we collect and why, how your data is handled and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.
If you have placed the Plausible Analytics script on your website, take a look at
our data policy
for details on the information we do collect about your website visitors on your behalf.
As a visitor to the plausible.io website
The privacy of our website visitors is important to us so we do not track any individual people. As a visitor to the plausible.io website:
No personal information is collected
No information such as cookies is stored in the browser
No information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties
No information is shared with advertising companies
No information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends
No information is monetized
We run the Plausible Analytics script to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected. You can view the data we collect in
our live demo
.
Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more. You can see full details in
our data policy
.
As a customer and subscriber of Plausible Analytics
Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need and that we will solely process this information to provide you with the service you signed up for.
We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain service offerings. These service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection, data privacy and security standards.
We only share information with them that is required for the services offered and we contractually bind them to keep any information we share with them as confidential and to process personal data only according to our instructions.
Here’s what that means in practice:
What we collect, what we use it for and services we use
An email address is required to create an account
. You need to provide us with your email address if you want to create a Plausible Analytics account. That’s just so you can log in and personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates or other essential information.
A persistent first-party cookie is stored to remember you’re logged in
. If you log in to your Plausible account, you give us permission to use cookies so you don’t have to log in on each returning session. This makes it easier for you to use our product. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. Cookies that are already stored may be deleted at any time.
All of the data that we collect is
kept fully secured, encrypted and hosted on 100% renewable energy powered server in Falkenstein, Germany
. The server is owned by Hetzner, a European company. This ensures that all of the site data is being covered by the European Union’s strict laws on data privacy. Your site data never leaves the EU. See
Hetzner privacy policy
for full details.
We use Bunny (another European-owned provider from Slovenia) for a global CDN, DNS and DDoS protection. This ensures that
all visitor data we collect is exclusively processed with servers owned and operated by European companies
. See Bunny
privacy and data policy
for full details.
We use UpCloud (also European-owned provider based in Finland) for
database hosting and storage of data exports
. See UpCloud
security and privacy policy
for full details.
The payment process is handled by a third-party payment provider
. If you choose to upgrade to a Plausible Analytics paid plan, the billing information and the payment process is handled by Paddle. See the
Paddle Privacy Policy
for full details.
All emails are sent using a third-party email provider
. Transactional emails and email reports (should you choose to subscribe to them) are sent using Postmark. We have disabled both open tracking and link tracking on all emails sent. See the
Postmark Privacy Policy
for full details.
We use Gravatar to get your account profile picture
. We use a proxy for this request to ensure no information is exposed to third parties. This method prevents the IP address, user agent and referrer header from being sent. See the
Gravatar Privacy Policy
for more details.
We use DuckDuckGo to get your site favicon
. We use a proxy for this request to ensure no information is exposed to third parties. This method prevents the IP address, user agent and referrer header from being sent. See the
DuckDuckGo Privacy Policy
for more details.
If you choose to import your Google Analytics data, integrate with Search Console or use the Looker Studio connector
, you will need to connect your Google account to Plausible. Google will share your name, email address, language preference, profile picture and website stats with us which allows us to provide the services you requested. We never sell or share this data with any third-parties. The use and transfer of information received from
Google APIs adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy
including the Limited Use requirements.
When you write to us with a question or to ask for help
. We keep that correspondence, which includes the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future. We use this data solely in connection with answering the queries we receive. We use Help Scout (
privacy policy
) as our help desk software.
When you submit feedback or feature requests
. We keep that feedback which includes the email address. We use this to understand the popularity of requests and to send you a notification when the feature you requested has been released. We use Nolt (
privacy policy
) as our feedback board.
We use CAPTCHA service as a means of spam protection on our account registration form
. hCaptcha is a GDPR-compliant and privacy-friendly captcha. See the
hCaptcha Privacy Policy
for full details.
For our blog readers who choose the option to receive blog posts via email
. We use Mailchimp to send those blog posts. We have disabled both open tracking and link tracking on all emails sent. See the
Mailchimp Privacy Policy
for full details.
Retention of data
We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the services or as otherwise set forth in this policy.
We will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Plausible’s legal rights.
You can choose to
delete your Plausible Analytics account at any time
. All your data will be permanently deleted immediately when you delete your account.
