The following discloses what information our websites and Apps (hereinafter "website" or "site") collect and what we do with it.

Use and Disclosure of Information
We do not collect your name or email address, unless you provide it on a registration form, order form, survey form, or send us an email. Our site's forms may ask or require you to give us contact information (such as your email address), financial information (such as your account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (such as your ZIP code or age). We use this information to provide information, products, or services that you request. For example, financial information is used to bill you for products and services that you order. Any information collected is primarily for internal Lifeway.com use and is not made available to any outside group or organization except other agencies associated with the Southern Baptist Convention or companies working with Lifeway.com for designated purposes.
You have the option to provide personally identifiable and demographic information (such as name, age, gender, ZIP code, church name, denomination, ministry involvement, job position, etc). We encourage you to submit this information so that we can better understand who our users are.
If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, we may combine such information with other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection.
We also may disclose personally identifiable information you provide via this site to third parties that are not Lifeway Christian Resources affiliates, but only:
to contractors we use to support our business (such as research vendor and technical support), in which case we will require such third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes;
to respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.
The collection, use, and disclosure of information contemplated in this Privacy Policy may involve a transfer of the information to jurisdictions located outside your country of residence that may not have equivalent laws and rules regarding personally identifiable information. By giving this information, you are giving your consent for such transfers and disclosures in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
It is important to note that we may transfer information internationally. If you are using our website in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or Uruguay, the following policy also applies and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy. To the extent that Lifeway Christian Resources is subject to the laws of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or Uruguay when processing personal data (“Personal Data”), it shall be the “data controller” under such laws.
Upon our verification of the applicability to your situation, You have the following rights:
Right to be informed (GDPR Articles 12 to 14): Data subjects have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data.
Right to access (GDPR Article 15): Data subjects have the right to view and request copies of their personal data.
Right to rectification (GDPR Article 16): Data subjects have the right to request inaccurate or outdated personal information be updated or corrected.
Right to be forgotten/Right to erasure (GDPR Article 17): Data subjects have the right to request their personal data be deleted. Note that this is not an absolute right and may be subject to exemptions based on certain laws.
Right to data portability (GDPR Article 20): Data subjects have the right to ask for their data to be transferred to another controller or provided to them. The data must be provided in a machine-readable electronic format.
Right to restrict processing (Article 18): Data subjects have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data.
Right to withdraw consent (GDPR Article 7): Data subjects have the right to withdraw previously given consent to process their personal data.

Children's Privacy
Lifeway Christian Resources takes children's privacy seriously and maintains compliance with the rules defined by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not seek to collect individually identifiable information for children under 13 years of age.
If Lifeway Christian Resources learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online, in contravention of these measures, Lifeway Christian Resources will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law).

You should keep in mind that no internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from this site may not be secure.
