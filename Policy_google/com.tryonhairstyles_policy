3. Choice/Opt-out

4. Information Disclosure to outside parties:
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
