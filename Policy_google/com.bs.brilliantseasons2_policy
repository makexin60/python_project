This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how non-personally identifiable information (“Information”) is collected, protected, and used in the “Show My Colors” mobile application (“Mobile Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of collected data and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and the Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
Information collection and Use
You can access and use the Mobile Application and Services without providing any personal information. The app does not handle accounts, and users cannot create any account within the app. All features of the Mobile Application can be used without requiring user registration or login.
For a better experience, the app may request access to certain device permissions (such as camera or storage) to function properly, but it does not collect or store personal information. However, the app may use third-party services that may collect personal information as part of their operations. These third-party services may include:
Google Play Services
Google Analytics for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics by Google
These services may collect non-personally identifiable data, including Log Data, such as device name, operating system version, IP address, app configuration details, and usage statistics. Additionally, depending on their terms, they may also collect personal information. This data is used solely for monitoring app performance, identifying causes for app crashes, and improving the app’s functionality. The legal basis for this processing is
legitimate interest
in maintaining and enhancing app performance. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand how they handle data.
User Rights under GDPR
Since we do not directly collect or store personal information, we do not process user data. However, users have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) concerning data collected by third-party services, including:
The right to access, modify, or delete any personal data collected by third-party services.
The right to object to data processing, where applicable.
The right to withdraw consent (if applicable) for third-party services that rely on consent-based processing.
The right to request data portability from relevant third-party providers.
To exercise these rights, users should refer to the respective privacy policies of third-party services used by the app and follow their instructions for managing data.
Retention of information
As the developer does not directly handle any personal information, there is no storage or retention of personally identifiable data by us. However, third-party service providers may retain usage data, including personal information, for analytical and operational purposes, as outlined in their respective privacy policies.
Opting Out of Data Collection
Users who wish to limit data collection by third-party services may:
Adjust their device settings to limit app permissions.
Disable interest-based ads via their Google or Apple account settings.
Use Google Play or Apple App Store privacy settings to manage third-party data sharing.
Transfer of information
Since the app does not collect or store personal information directly, there is no transfer of such data by us. However, analytics and crash reports processed by third-party services may involve data transfers in accordance with their privacy policies and applicable data protection laws.
Privacy of children
The app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since no user accounts are created and no personal data is stored, there is no risk of unauthorized data collection from minors. If you believe that a child has provided personal information to a third-party service used by the app, please contact the respective service provider to request deletion.
Links to other resources
The Mobile Application and Services may contain links to external resources that are not owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties and encourage users to review their privacy policies before interacting with their services.
Information security
We strive to maintain high security standards to protect non-personally identifiable data processed by third-party services. However, no digital system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of transmitted data.
Data breach
As we do not collect or store personal information, there is no risk of a personal data breach from our direct handling of user data. In the event of a security incident affecting third-party services, users will be notified by those service providers in accordance with their privacy policies and applicable laws.
Changes and amendments
We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms at any time and will notify users of any material changes. Updates will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Policy within the Mobile Application or on our official website. Continued use of the Mobile Application and Services after changes to this Policy constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
Acceptance of this policy
By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to its terms. If you do not agree to this Policy, you must discontinue use of the Mobile Application and Services.
