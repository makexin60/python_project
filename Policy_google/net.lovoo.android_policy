Collection, Processing, and Use of Personal Data
Personal data is all information pertaining to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and email address).
When we process personal data, this means that we collect, store, use this data, forward it to others, or delete it.
LOVOO will only collect and process your personal data in the following cases:
If you visit our website and are not a user.
If you contact us directly.
If you install the LOVOO app.
If you register on LOVOO or subscribe to LOVOO and then use LOVOO.
You provide your personal data on a voluntary basis when entering into a contractual relationship with LOVOO or as part of an existing contractual relationship with LOVOO. However, you are required to provide special categories of personal data (e.g. the gender you are interested in, which is data relating to sexual orientation), as well as to answer questions about your LOVOO profile, in order to register on LOVOO. You must make your profile information visible to other LOVOO users in order to use the LOVOO service.
Please note that we provide the LOVOO service in many different countries and the information in your profile is visible to other users in all of these countries. Your profile will be displayed in the country corresponding to your GPS location, provided you have agreed to this, and the search settings of the respective user. If we cannot access your GPS location, we will use your IP address and country code to set your approximate location to your state capital.
If you do not want LOVOO to process your personal data or parts of it, LOVOO cannot provide its service as stated in the
Terms and Conditions
.
What data LOVOO collects in detail, you can see in the following explanations.
Data Processing by App Stores
If you install the LOVOO app using a third-party app store operator (e.g. Google or Apple), you may have to enter into a usage agreement with the respective app store operator regarding access to its portal. To gain this access, you must have a valid account with the app store operator and an appropriate terminal device (e.g. smartphone); LOVOO has no control over data processing in this context. The app store operator of the respective app platform is the sole data controller. If needed, please contact the app store operator (third-party provider) directly for information about its data processing. In this case, LOVOO is only the data controller when the LOVOO app is used.
What Data Does LOVOO Collect From Users in Order to Fulfill the Contractual Relationship?
LOVOO must process the personal data described below that you (also referred to as “LOVOO user”) provide during the registration process in order to render the services described in more detail in our
General Terms and Conditions.
Registration Process
When registering, which is initially free of charge, the user is asked to provide a minimum amount of data that are required to complete the registration process. This data includes:
Username (pseudonym)
City
Date of birth
Your own gender and the gender you are interested in (the gender you are interested in indicates your sexual orientation and is therefore a special category of personal data)
Profile picture
Phone number (if you register via mobile phone)
Email address
Password selected by the user
If you have selected login through third-party providers such as Facebook, Google, Snapchat or Apple, you do not provide an email address or a password during the registration process.
Users then access LOVOO using the email address they provided and the password they selected (login credentials) or, alternatively, using the login credentials of the third-party provider.
Registering via Facebook (“Facebook login”)
LOVOO offers single sign-on via Facebook. This offers you the option of registering via your Facebook account. If you use the function, we receive and process the following authentication data from Facebook for the registration: Your email address, profile name, gender, date of birth, and profile picture stored there. Data is transferred in this respect.
When you log in to our website or app using Facebook, Facebook will also collect data from third-party scripts, process it for Facebook analytics purposes, or forward it to third parties. Facebook’s Privacy Policy outlines the data that may be collected when you use the Facebook login. This includes data about your device, your use of LOVOO, the websites you have visited, and the ads you have viewed. Unfortunately, you technically cannot refuse this processing on LOVOO. If you would not like Facebook to collect data about you related to your use of our online offering and to use it for its own purposes, you should not use the Facebook login.
You can disassociate your LOVOO account from your Facebook account at any time on our website. In this case, we would need you to provide the aforementioned access data. Unfortunately, this cannot be done on the LOVOO app.
Further information about the purpose and scope of the collection and the further processing and use of your data by Facebook, as well as your rights and settings options for protecting your data, is available in Facebook’s Privacy Policy:

This service (Firebase service) is provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, in the USA, and is only possible if you have given us your prior consent.
Further information about the purpose and scope of the processing of your data by Google can be found in Google’s privacy policy:
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy.
Voluntary Information
You can also enter a variety of voluntary information in your user account, e.g. by uploading additional pictures to your profile, entering information on specific questions, and setting search filters (e.g. age and gender). This voluntary information is visible to other logged-in LOVOO users on LOVOO, but it can be deleted or modified by the account holder at any time in the user account settings. If the user specifies the gender or age he/she is looking for, only users of this gender or age will be displayed in the dating feature.
This data is specifically used for LOVOO’s feature for selecting recommendations for other user accounts according to different criteria for the user and displaying them on LOVOO. Providing additional information increases your chances of making contact with suitable LOVOO users.

LOVOO users can share content with other users through the platform, for example by sharing content in chat messages, including voice messages.
Information Regarding Sexual Orientation
You may provide information on our platform about your gender and the gender you prefer with regard to matches and other users. If you do provide this information, LOVOO or other users may infer your sexual orientation.

Your Right to Revoke Consent
” below).

This online offering also includes location-based services. This includes the “Nearby” function. You can find a detailed description of this function in our
LOVOO GTCs
. We record the location of your mobile end device using the GPS function for this purpose. This requires that you have explicitly requested the corresponding services and/or consented to the processing of location data.

LOVOO does not process any payment and billing details in this respect.

If we process special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR, Article 9 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR Paragraph 2 a) of the GDPR – your consent – and Article 9 Paragraph 2 a) e) of the GDPR will serve as the legal basis, provided that you have publicly disclosed your sexual orientation (e.g. in your profile text or in a live video).

If processing is necessary to safeguard one of LOVOO’s legitimate interests, or a legitimate interest of a third party, such as its users, and if the data subject’s interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms do not take precedence over the former interest, the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR or Article 31 (1) of the nFADP serves as the legal basis for processing.
If we store information in your terminal equipment or access such information that is already stored in your terminal equipment, Section 25 (1) TTDSG serves as the legal basis.
Insofar as the storage of information in your terminal equipment or the access to information already stored in your terminal equipment is absolutely necessary, Section 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG serves as the legal basis.
Further processing has Article 6 (1) of GDPR and Article 31 (1) of the nFADP as legal basis depending on processing constellation.
In the case of personal data processing that is necessary for self-promotion (free use and subscriptions), in addition to the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR, Section 7 (3) of the German Act against Unfair Competition (UWG) also serves as the legal basis, or in addition to Article 31 (1) of the nFADP, Article 3 (1) (o) also serves as the legal basis.
for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) (the legal basis in these cases is UK GDPR Article 9(2)(j) or Article 6(1)(e) in conjunction with Article 6(2)).
If the legal basis is your consent, you are entitled to revoke your consent at any time without this affecting the lawfulness of the processing performed on the basis of the consent up to the time of revocation. If the legal basis is the legitimate interest, you are also entitled in principle to object to the processing of personal data pertaining to you at any time for reasons resulting from your particular situation. Article 21 of the GDPR applies in this respect. Article 21 of the GDPR applies in this respect.

in relation to legal disputes (with courts or our lawyers), debt collection cases or economic or operational audits (with economic/operational auditors);
to the competent investigative authorities with regard to possible criminal acts;
in the event of sale of the business (with respect to the acquirer).

Cookie and Tracking Policy,
LOVOO uses service providers to send emails and push notifications to LOVOO users. Service providers also provide LOVOO with server capacity. If LOVOO users make in-app purchases on LOVOO, buy “credits” or take out subscriptions, they do so using external payment providers. PE Digital GmbH does not process any payment data when a purchase is made. Depending on the payment method you select during the ordering process, we forward the data collected for the processing of payments (e.g. bank details or credit card data) to the bank responsible for the payment or to payment service providers contracted by us.
In some cases, payment service providers also collect this data themselves under their own responsibility. For instance, this is the case when you make in-app purchases using an app store operator. In this respect, the Privacy Policy of the respective payment service provider or app store operator will apply.
Service providers are generally contracted as processors who may only process the personal data of users of this online service in accordance with LOVOO’s instructions.

Forwarding of Data to Non-EEA Countries
Your personal data may also be disclosed to third parties (jointly or severally with us) or processors located in non-EU/EEA countries.  In this case, we ensure before the transfer that the recipient has an adequate level of data protection (e.g. based on an
adequacy decision of the European Commission
for the country in question pursuant to Article 45 of the GDPR or the agreement of “
standard contractual clauses
” of the European Union with the recipient pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR using additional technical and organizational protective measures).  Also see Article 16 (f) of the nFADP regarding the disclosure of personal data abroad.
If necessary, we also conclude a corresponding “UK addendum” with our contractual partners in accordance with the requirements set out by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and a corresponding “CH addendum” in accordance with the requirements set out by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC).
You can request that we provide you with an overview of the specific recipients (both companies within the Group and all processors) in third countries and a copy of the specifically agreed regulations (EU standard contractual clauses, if applicable, including the UK addendum or CH addendum, if relevant) to ensure the adequate level of data protection.

DURATION OF STORAGE; RETENTION REQUIREMENTS
We store your data for as long as this is required to provide our online offering (and the associated services) or we have a legitimate interest in continued storage. In all other cases, we delete your personal data with the exception of data that we are required to keep for longer in order to comply with contractual or statutory (e.g. fiscal or commercial) retention periods (e.g. invoices).
We block data that is subject to a retention period until the period expires.
The personal data of LOVOO users who have taken out a subscription with LOVOO is generally stored for the duration of the contractual relationship. If you do not ask us to erase your data after your subscription expires, your LOVOO user account will still exist.
LOVOO automatically erases the personal data of LOVOO users who do not have LOVOO Premium, LOVOO Credits or LOVOO Diamonds and who are inactive for 24 months.
As soon as you revoke your consent or assert your right of revocation, we will delete the data immediately. You can delete your profile or account on LOVOO at any time in your account on the website or on the LOVOO app. Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care Team and request the erasure of your data. In such a case, all your data is deleted, unless statutory retention requirements or another reason (e.g. defense or enforcement of claims, evidence reasons, incidents of misuse, billing purposes, another legitimate interest) requires the further storage or processing of your data.
Please note that uninstalling the LOVOO app from your device does not delete the data in your profile.
LOVOO stores log files for up to 90 days, after which they are deleted. Log files for which further retention is required for evidence purposes are exempt from deletion until the relevant incident has been definitively clarified and may be passed on to investigating authorities in individual cases.
LOVOO stores the data required for the purpose of fulfillment or proof during the respective limitation period in connection with the assertion of data subject rights.
Shared content, e.g. content that is sent via chat messages (attachments) and the chat messages themselves: Until the user deletes the account.
ARE YOU REQUIRED TO PROVIDE US WITH PERSONAL DATA?
You are not legally or statutorily required to provide us with your personal data. However, the use of certain services of our online offering may require the provision of personal data, e.g. registration or participation in a competition. If this is the case, we will inform you about this separately (e.g. in the form of a separate Privacy Policy for any competition). Mandatory information is usually marked with an asterisk (*). If you do not wish to provide us with the necessary data, you will not be able to use these services.
OVERVIEW OF DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
How can you assert your rights?
Please refer to the information in the
Contact
section to assert your rights and enable us to clearly identify you when you assert your rights.
You can also use the settings options in your LOVOO profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising. There are a few exceptions to this, including a new change of date of birth, revocation of the processing of the sexual orientation information, and a change of gender, which can only be changed with the help of the Customer Care Team.
Please note that your data will usually only be blocked if there are retention requirements that prevent deletion.
Right to Information and Right to Rectification
You have the right to request information from LOVOO as to whether we process personal data pertaining to you. You also have the right to information about this personal data and details on the category of data that is stored, the purpose of processing, any recipients, the storage period, and the data subject rights to which you are entitled. If your data is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that your data be rectified or completed. If we have disclosed your information to third parties, we will inform them of the rectification where this is a legal requirement.
If you would like to assert a right to information, please refer to the details provided in the
Contact
section.
Your right to erasure
Provided that the legal requirements are met, you may demand that we immediately erase your personal data. This is particularly the case where
your personal data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected;
the legal basis for the processing was exclusively your consent and you have revoked this;
you have objected to the processing for commercial purposes (“objection to advertising”);
you have objected to processing in accordance with the legal basis of balancing interests on personal grounds and we cannot demonstrate that there are overriding legitimate grounds for processing;
your personal data has been unlawfully processed; or
your personal data must be erased in order to comply with legal requirements.
Please note that your right to erasure is subject to restrictions.
We have the right not to comply with such a request if we process the personal data for any of the following reasons:
For exercising the right of freedom of expression and information.
For compliance with a legal obligation.
For the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority.
For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
For the establishment or defense of legal claims.
You may also erase the data in your profile yourself. To do this, log in to your profile on the LOVOO platform and erase your profile under Settings – My Account – “Delete account.” Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care Team and request the erasure of your data. Please refer to the information in the
Contact
. Please note that your data will initially only be blocked if there are retention requirements that prevent erasure.
Your Right to Restriction of Processing
Provided that the legal requirements are met, you may demand that we restrict processing. This is particularly the case where
you dispute the accuracy of your personal data, and then for as long as we have had the opportunity to verify the accuracy;
the processing is not lawful and you request restriction of use instead of erasure (see the previous section for this);
the processing is not lawful and you request restriction of use instead of erasure (see the previous section for this);
you have raised an objection on personal grounds, and then for as long as it takes to determine whether your interests prevail.
Alternatively, you can use the settings options in your profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising. Some of the data collected about you can only be modified with the help of the Customer Care Team.
Your Right to Data Portability
You have the right to receive personal data, which you provide to us to fulfill a contract or on the basis of consent, in a portable format. In this case, you may also request that we transfer this data directly to a third party, provided that this is technically feasible.
Your Right to Revoke Consent
If you have granted us consent to process your data, you may revoke this consent at any time with future effect. The lawfulness of the processing of your data until the time of revocation remains unaffected by this.
You have provided us with data regarding your sexual orientation (gender and gender you are interested in). You may revoke this consent at any time with future effect. The lawfulness of the processing of your data until the time of revocation remains unaffected by this. From the time you object to the processing of your sexual orientation data, matches can no longer be made unless you consent again to the processing of your sexual orientation data, and LOVOO will no longer be able to provide its services as described in our
General Terms and Conditions
as a result of your objection. To revoke your consent to the processing of your gender preference information, please email our Customer Care Team at
support@lovoo.com
with “Objection to use sexual orientation data” in the subject line.
Your Right to Object to Direct Marketing
You may also object to the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes (“objection to advertising”) at any time, provided that the data processing is conducted on the basis of legitimate interest. Please note that there may be an overlap between your revocation and the use of your data in the context of an ongoing campaign for organizational reasons.
Alternatively, you can use the settings options in your profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising.
Your Right to Object on Personal Grounds
You have the right to object to data processing by us for reasons related to your particular situation, provided that it is done on the legal basis of legitimate interest. In compliance with legislation, we will then stop processing your data unless we can prove that there are compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing your data that override your rights.
Right to Lodge a Complaint With the Responsible Regulatory Authority
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. You may contact the data protection authority responsible for your place of residence, your federal state, or the data protection authority responsible for us.

Collection, Processing, and Use of Personal Data
Personal data is all information pertaining to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and email address).
When we process personal data, this means that we collect, store, use this data, forward it to others, or delete it.
LOVOO will only collect and process your personal data in the following cases:
If you visit our website and are not a user.
If you contact us directly.
If you install the LOVOO app.
If you register on LOVOO or subscribe to LOVOO and then use LOVOO.
You provide your personal data on a voluntary basis when entering into a contractual relationship with LOVOO or as part of an existing contractual relationship with LOVOO. However, you are required to provide special categories of personal data (e.g. the gender you are interested in, which is data relating to sexual orientation), as well as to answer questions about your LOVOO profile, in order to register on LOVOO. You must make your profile information visible to other LOVOO users in order to use the LOVOO service.
Please note that we provide the LOVOO service in many different countries and the information in your profile is visible to other users in all of these countries. Your profile will be displayed in the country corresponding to your GPS location, provided you have agreed to this, and the search settings of the respective user. If we cannot access your GPS location, we will use your IP address and country code to set your approximate location to your state capital.
If you do not want LOVOO to process your personal data or parts of it, LOVOO cannot provide its service as stated in the
Terms and Conditions
.
What data LOVOO collects in detail, you can see in the following explanations.
Data Processing by App Stores
If you install the LOVOO app using a third-party app store operator (e.g. Google or Apple), you may have to enter into a usage agreement with the respective app store operator regarding access to its portal. To gain this access, you must have a valid account with the app store operator and an appropriate terminal device (e.g. smartphone); LOVOO has no control over data processing in this context. The app store operator of the respective app platform is the sole data controller. If needed, please contact the app store operator (third-party provider) directly for information about its data processing. In this case, LOVOO is only the data controller when the LOVOO app is used.
What Data Does LOVOO Collect From Users in Order to Fulfill the Contractual Relationship?
LOVOO must process the personal data described below that you (also referred to as “LOVOO user”) provide during the registration process in order to render the services described in more detail in our
General Terms and Conditions.
Registration Process
When registering, which is initially free of charge, the user is asked to provide a minimum amount of data that are required to complete the registration process. This data includes:
Username (pseudonym)
City
Date of birth
Your own gender and the gender you are interested in (the gender you are interested in indicates your sexual orientation and is therefore a special category of personal data)
Profile picture
Phone number (if you register via mobile phone)
Email address
Password selected by the user
If you have selected login through third-party providers such as Facebook, Google, Snapchat or Apple, you do not provide an email address or a password during the registration process.
Users then access LOVOO using the email address they provided and the password they selected (login credentials) or, alternatively, using the login credentials of the third-party provider.
Registering via Facebook (“Facebook login”)
LOVOO offers single sign-on via Facebook. This offers you the option of registering via your Facebook account. If you use the function, we receive and process the following authentication data from Facebook for the registration: Your email address, profile name, gender, date of birth, and profile picture stored there. Data is transferred in this respect.
When you log in to our website or app using Facebook, Facebook will also collect data from third-party scripts, process it for Facebook analytics purposes, or forward it to third parties. Facebook’s Privacy Policy outlines the data that may be collected when you use the Facebook login. This includes data about your device, your use of LOVOO, the websites you have visited, and the ads you have viewed. Unfortunately, you technically cannot refuse this processing on LOVOO. If you would not like Facebook to collect data about you related to your use of our online offering and to use it for its own purposes, you should not use the Facebook login.
You can disassociate your LOVOO account from your Facebook account at any time on our website. In this case, we would need you to provide the aforementioned access data. Unfortunately, this cannot be done on the LOVOO app.
Further information about the purpose and scope of the collection and the further processing and use of your data by Facebook, as well as your rights and settings options for protecting your data, is available in Facebook’s Privacy Policy:
http://www.facebook.com/policy.php

We have no control over the scope of the data collected by Google using the Google login. If you would not like Google to collect data about you related to your use of our online offering and to use it for its own purposes, you should not use the Google login.

https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/sign-in-with-apple/
.
When registering/logging in via telephone authentication

We will then send you an SMS with a verification code that you must enter in the app to complete the registration process. When you want to log in, we will send you an SMS with a code that you can use to log into your account. In addition, a verification process will take place. This service (Firebase service) is provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, in the USA, and is only possible if you have given us your prior consent.
Further information about the purpose and scope of the processing of your data by Google can be found in Google’s privacy policy:
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy.
Voluntary Information
You can also enter a variety of voluntary information in your user account, e.g. by uploading additional pictures to your profile, entering information on specific questions, and setting search filters (e.g. age and gender). This voluntary information is visible to other logged-in LOVOO users on LOVOO, but it can be deleted or modified by the account holder at any time in the user account settings. If the user specifies the gender or age he/she is looking for, only users of this gender or age will be displayed in the dating feature.
This data is specifically used for LOVOO’s feature for selecting recommendations for other user accounts according to different criteria for the user and displaying them on LOVOO. Providing additional information increases your chances of making contact with suitable LOVOO users.
Shared Content
LOVOO users can share content with other users through the platform, for example by sharing content in chat messages, including voice messages.
Information Regarding Sexual Orientation
You may provide information on our platform about your gender and the gender you prefer with regard to matches and other users. If you do provide this information, LOVOO or other users may infer your sexual orientation.
This information may be public depending on the function and/or settings on the platform. You may revoke your consent to your data being processed at any time (see section “
Your Right to Revoke Consent
” below).
Processing of Location Data
This online offering also includes location-based services. This includes the “Nearby” function. You can find a detailed description of this function in our
LOVOO GTCs
. We record the location of your mobile end device using the GPS function for this purpose. This requires that you have explicitly requested the corresponding services and/or consented to the processing of location data. You can also disable our access to location data at any time in your mobile terminal device’s device settings.

If you decide to purchase a paid LOVOO service (a “premium subscription”) through LOVOO, the following information will be collected within the order process in addition to the data collected during the basic membership:

Placing orders through third parties
If you order a premium subscription or credits through an app store operator (e.g. Google or Apple) as a third-party provider, these app platform operators’ terms of use specify what personal data they process in the course of the order process. LOVOO does not process any payment and billing details in this respect.

If we process special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR, Article 9 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR Paragraph 2 a) of the GDPR – your consent – and Article 9 Paragraph 2 a) e) of the GDPR will serve as the legal basis, provided that you have publicly disclosed your sexual orientation (e.g. in your profile text or in a live video).

This also applies to processing operations required to perform pre-contractual measures.
In the case of personal data processing to fulfill a legal obligation, the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (c) of the GDPR or Article 31 (1) of the nFADP serves as the legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard one of LOVOO’s legitimate interests, or a legitimate interest of a third party, such as its users, and if the data subject’s interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms do not take precedence over the former interest, the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR or Article 31 (1) of the nFADP serves as the legal basis for processing.
If we store information in your terminal equipment or access such information that is already stored in your terminal equipment, Section 25 (1) TTDSG serves as the legal basis.
Insofar as the storage of information in your terminal equipment or the access to information already stored in your terminal equipment is absolutely necessary, Section 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG serves as the legal basis.
Further processing has Article 6 (1) of GDPR and Article 31 (1) of the nFADP as legal basis depending on processing constellation.
In the case of personal data processing that is necessary for self-promotion (free use and subscriptions), in addition to the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR, Section 7 (3) of the German Act against Unfair Competition (UWG) also serves as the legal basis, or in addition to Article 31 (1) of the nFADP, Article 3 (1) (o) also serves as the legal basis.
for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) (the legal basis in these cases is UK GDPR Article 9(2)(j) or Article 6(1)(e) in conjunction with Article 6(2)).
If the legal basis is your consent, you are entitled to revoke your consent at any time without this affecting the lawfulness of the processing performed on the basis of the consent up to the time of revocation. If the legal basis is the legitimate interest, you are also entitled in principle to object to the processing of personal data pertaining to you at any time for reasons resulting from your particular situation. Article 21 of the GDPR applies in this respect. Article 21 of the GDPR applies in this respect.

The following personal data may also be transferred to third parties:
to service providers, provided that the data is required to execute a data processing agreement with us;
if applicable, to providers of market tracking technologies and analysis tools (more information is available in our
Cookie and Tracking Policy
);
if we are required to do so by law or by enforceable official or court order in individual cases;
in relation to legal disputes (with courts or our lawyers), debt collection cases or economic or operational audits (with economic/operational auditors);
to the competent investigative authorities with regard to possible criminal acts;
in the event of sale of the business (with respect to the acquirer).

In this respect, the Privacy Policy of the respective payment service provider or app store operator will apply.
Service providers are generally contracted as processors who may only process the personal data of users of this online service in accordance with LOVOO’s instructions.

adequacy decision of the European Commission
for the country in question pursuant to Article 45 of the GDPR or the agreement of “
standard contractual clauses
” of the European Union with the recipient pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR using additional technical and organizational protective measures).  Also see Article 16 (f) of the nFADP regarding the disclosure of personal data abroad.
If necessary, we also conclude a corresponding “UK addendum” with our contractual partners in accordance with the requirements set out by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and a corresponding “CH addendum” in accordance with the requirements set out by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC).

Your Right to Object on Personal Grounds

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

„Mit Apple anmelden“ ermöglicht dir die Anmeldung bei Apps und Websites, wobei deine Privatsphäre gewahrt wird.
Einige Entwicklungsteams werden evtl. nach deinem Namen fragen, den du ändern kannst. Möglicherweise fragen sie auch nach deiner E-Mail-Adresse, die du direkt weitergeben oder ein Alias verwenden kannst.
Apple weiß, dass du die Option „Anmelden mit Apple“ für eine App oder Website aktiviert hast, aber verfolgt nicht, bei welchen Apps oder Websites du dich anmeldest bzw. wann.
Wenn du dich erstmals mit „Mit Apple anmelden“ bei einer App anmeldest, verwendet Apple Informationen über deinen Account und deine Erfahrungen mit Apple zusammen mit Infos über dein Gerät und über Gerätenutzungsmuster, um Betrug zu vermeiden.
„Mit Apple anmelden“ aktivieren
Die Funktion „Mit Apple anmelden“ schützt deine Privatsphäre dadurch, dass du dich bei Apps (oder App Clips) anmelden kannst, ohne dem Entwicklungsteam Informationen preiszugeben, die Rückschlüsse auf deine Person zulassen. Mit „Mit Apple anmelden“ kannst du dich auch bei einer Website anmelden, ohne dem Entwicklungsteam – abgesehen von den Informationen, die der Browser für normale Webfunktionen verwendet – zusätzliche Informationen bereitzustellen, die dich persönlich zu erkennen geben. Beim Anmelden mit der Option „Mit Apple anmelden“ stellt Apple dem Entwicklungsteam stattdessen eine eindeutige ID zur Verfügung. Auf diese Weise bleiben deine Daten zuverlässig geschützt. Für jedes Entwicklungsteam wird eine andere ID generiert, sodass Entwicklungsteams daran gehindert werden, Informationen über dich appübergreifend zu sammeln und zu teilen. Entwicklungsteams können sich ebenfalls dafür entscheiden, „Mit Apple anmelden“ zum Anmelden bei ihren Apps oder Websites für vorhandene Accounts zu verwenden. Wenn ein Entwicklungsteam dies ermöglicht, kannst du den bereits vorhandenen Account behalten und dich dennoch mit „Mit Apple anmelden“ anmelden.
Da bestimmte Apps berechtigte Gründe haben können, mehr Informationen über dich zu sammeln (etwa um namentlich auf deinen Account zu verweisen oder dich per E-Mail zu kontaktieren), können einige Entwicklungsteams nach deinem Namen oder deiner E-Mail-Adresse fragen, wenn du „Mit Apple anmelden“ verwendest. Hierbei wird standardmäßig der Name verwendet, der deinem Apple Account zugeordnet ist. Du kannst diesen Namen bearbeiten, bevor du ihn mit dem Entwicklungsteam teilst. Wenn das Entwicklungsteam nach einer E‑Mail-Adresse fragt, kannst du wahlweise eine der E‑Mail-Adressen nennen, die deinem Apple Account zugeordnet sind, oder deine E‑Mail-Adresse ausblenden. Wenn deine E-Mail-Adresse ausgeblendet werden soll, generiert Apple für das Entwicklungsteam eine eindeutige E-Mail-Adresse, die diese dann für die Kommunikation mit dir verwenden können. Apple leitet die von dieser Adresse empfangenen E‑Mails an eine E‑Mail-Adresse weiter, die deinem Apple Account zugeordnet ist. Apple löscht diese Nachrichten dann nach dem Versand oder nach einem kurzen Zeitraum, wenn sie unzustellbar waren. Auf deinem iOS-, iPadOS- oder visionOS-Gerät kannst du die E‑Mail-Adresse, an die Nachrichten weitergeleitet werden, ändern oder die Weiterleitung von Nachrichten deaktivieren. Wähle dazu „Einstellungen“ > „[dein Name]“ > „iCloud“ > „iCloud-Mail“ > „E‑Mail-Weiterleitung“. Auf deinem Mac nimmst du die Änderung unter „Systemeinstellungen“ > „[dein Name]“ > „Persönliche Daten“ vor. Wenn du eine E‑Mail-Adresse deaktivierst und löschst, die du mit „E‑Mail-Adresse verbergen“ verwendest, wird sie in Verbindung mit deinem Apple Account 30 Tage lang zur Vorbeugung von Missbrauch gespeichert. Im Anschluss wird die entfernte E‑Mail-Adresse dauerhaft von deinem Apple Account gelöscht und ausschließlich aus Sicherheitsgründen, z. B. um die E‑Mail-Adresse nicht erneut auszustellen, aufbewahrt.
Wenn du „Mit Apple anmelden“ für eine App aktivierst, wird diese Auswahl mit dem Apple Account verknüpft, die du für iCloud verwendest. So kannst du „Mit Apple anmelden“ für die App einfach auf all deinen Apple-Geräten verwenden.
Wenn du zum ersten Mal „Mit Apple anmelden“ für eine neue App verwendest, teilt Apple zur Betrugsprävention und aus Sicherheitsgründen dem Entwicklungsteam einen einfachen Zahlencode mit, damit dieser darauf vertrauen kann, dass du eine echte Person bist. Dieser Code wird aus deiner aktuellen Apple Account-Aktivität abgeleitet und mit von deinem Gerät und deinen Gerätenutzungsmustern extrahierten Informationen kombiniert. Weder Apple noch das Entwicklungsteam erhalten spezielle Informationen dazu, wie du dein Gerät nutzt.
„Mit Apple anmelden“ verwenden
Apple weiß, wann du „Mit Apple anmelden“ für eine App oder Website aktivierst, und kann dir beim Einrichten der Anmeldung helfen. Wenn du „Mit Apple anmelden“ mit einer App auf deinem iPhone verwendest, verbleiben die Informationen dazu, welche Apps du zum Anmelden verwendest oder wann du „Mit Apple anmelden“ verwendest, auf deinem Gerät. Apple kann diese Information weder sehen noch speichern. Wenn du „Mit Apple anmelden“ in Safari verwendest, sieht Apple, wann du dich bei einer Website anmeldest, um deine Anmeldung authentifizieren zu können. Apple speichert jedoch weder die Websites, bei denen du dich anmeldest, noch, wann du „Mit Apple anmelden“ verwendest.
Auch wenn du dich mit „Mit Apple anmelden“ bei einer App oder Website anmeldest, wirst du u. U. nach der Anmeldung von Entwicklungsteams nach persönlichen Informationen gefragt. Persönliche Informationen, die du Entwicklungsteams zur Verfügung stellst, unterliegen deren Datenschutzrichtlinie.
„Mit Apple anmelden“ verwalten
Um „Mit Apple anmelden“ zu verwalten, wählst du in iOS „Einstellungen“ > „[dein Name]“ > „Anmeldung & Sicherheit“ > „Apps“. Auf dem Mac öffnest du „Systemeinstellungen“ > „[dein Name]“ > „Anmeldung & Sicherheit“. Alternativ kannst du
account.apple.com
besuchen und unter dem Abschnitt „Anmeldung und Sicherheit“ die Option „Mit Apple anmelden“ wählen. Dort findest du eine Liste der Apps, die „Mit Apple anmelden“ verwenden. Außerdem kannst du die Datenschutzrichtlinie lesen und die Option „Mit Apple anmelden“ deaktivieren. Wenn du „Mit Apple anmelden“ für eine App deaktivierst, werden die Informationen, die du mit dem Entwicklungsteam geteilt hast, um „Mit Apple anmelden“ für diese App einzurichten, sowie die Informationen, die es deinem Account für „Mit Apple anmelden“ zugeordnet hat, weiterhin gemäß der Datenschutzrichtlinie dieses Entwicklungsteams behandelt.
Weitere Informationen
Apple arbeitet daran, die Option „Mit Apple anmelden“ mit einer starken Authentifizierung zu schützen, die durch Touch ID, Face ID und starke Codeoptionen durchgesetzt wird.
Apple erhält möglicherweise anonyme und aggregierte Informationen über „Mit Apple anmelden“, etwa Informationen über deine Nutzung von „Mit Apple anmelden“. Die erfassten Informationen lassen keine Rückschlüsse auf deine Person zu. Apple kann Informationen, die dich nicht zu erkennen geben, zur Verbesserung von Apple-Produkten und -Diensten, für Marketing-Zwecke sowie zur Betrugsprävention und zu Sicherheitszwecken verwenden. Apple unternimmt keinerlei Versuch, anonyme oder aggregierte Daten zu „Mit Apple anmelden“, die Apple erhält, zu reidentifizieren.
Apple verwendet deine Informationen wie gesetzlich vorgeschrieben und zur Betrugsprävention. Durch die Verwendung von „Mit Apple anmelden“ erklärst du dein Einverständnis damit, dass Apple, seine Tochtergesellschaften und Vertreter diese Informationen wie oben beschrieben übertragen, sammeln, verwalten, verarbeiten und verwenden.
Apple speichert persönliche Informationen nur während des Zeitraums, der zur Erfüllung der jeweiligen Sammlungszwecke erforderlich ist, sowie gemäß der Datenschutzrichtlinie von Apple, unseres dienstspezifischen Datenschutzhinweises oder der gesetzlichen Vorgaben. Bei der Festlegung von Speicherzeiträumen untersuchen wir zunächst, ob das Speichern der gesammelten persönlichen Informationen notwendig ist. Ist dies der Fall, speichern wir die persönlichen Informationen für den gemäß Gesetz kürzest möglichen Zeitraum.
Die von Apple erfassten Informationen werden jederzeit gemäß der Apple-Datenschutzrichtlinie behandelt, die unter
www.apple.com/de/privacy
zu finden ist.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.
Examples of information collected by Crashlytics

The Crashlytics Installation UUID
The Firebase installations ID (FID)
The Firebase session ID, which is a random UUID generated to tag events
      with a session
The timestamp of when the crash occurred
The app's bundle identifier and full version number
The device's operating system name and version number
A boolean indicating whether the device was jailbroken/rooted
The device's model name, CPU architecture, amount of RAM and disk
      space

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring
:

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Data encryption
Firebase services encrypt data in transit using HTTPS and logically isolate
customer data.
In addition, several Firebase services also encrypt their data at rest:
Cloud Firestore
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Cloud Functions for Firebase
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase Realtime Database
Cloud Storage for Firebase
Firebase Crashlytics
Firebase Test Lab
Firebase App Check
Firebase App Distribution
Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
Firebase Service Data
Firebase Service Data is personal information that Google collects and generates
during the provision and administration of the Firebase services
*
,
excluding Customer Data
**
as defined in our customer agreements
covering Firebase services and
Google Cloud Service Data
.
Examples of Firebase Service Data include information about service usage,
resource identifiers like application IDs and package name/bundle IDs, technical
and operational details of usage such as IP addresses, and direct communications
with developers from feedback and support related conversations.
*Services covered include Firebase A/B Testing, Firebase App Distribution,
  Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Dynamic Links,
  Firebase Hosting, Firebase In-App Messaging, Firebase ML,
  Firebase Performance Monitoring, Firebase Realtime Database,
  Firebase Remote Config, and Firebase User Segmentation Storage.
**For more information about how we process Customer Data, see our
Firebase Data Processing and Security
  Terms
