Your privacy is critically important to us. Handy Apps has a few guiding principles:
We don’t allow you to send Handy Apps critically important information like your usernames, passwords, account notes, and master PIN; instead your master PIN is used locally to encrypt the important data that’s sent to us so that no one, including Handy Apps employees ever can access it.
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our apps.
Handy Apps operates several websites including handyappsforlife.com. It is Handy Apps’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Below is our privacy statement which incorporates these goals:
Locker Apps Users
This includes users of apps with encryption features developed by Handy Apps. Your information entered into the apps, for example email address, passwords, credit card numbers are PIN-protected so that only you should have secure access to adding and editing stored information. The email address is only sent when a PIN recovery request is requested by the user, for solely the purpose of sending the recovery email to the user, and the email address and email contents are never stored nor preserved, nor will be used for other purposes. The user is responsible in protecting the security of their PIN and stored information. The apps are designed with internal security processes that encrypt stored data with 128-bit/256-bit AES encryption (refer to the individual apps for more information).
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Handy Apps collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Handy Apps’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Handy Apps’ visitors use its website. From time to time, Handy Apps may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Handy Apps’ websites choose to interact with Handy Apps in ways that require Handy Apps to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Handy Apps gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who filled in the feedback contact form at handyappsforlife.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Handy Apps are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the email address required to process those enquiries. In each case, Handy Apps collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Handy Apps. Handy Apps does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Use of personal data
Handy Apps may collect aggregated statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Handy Apps may monitor the most popular app description page on the handyappsforlife.com site. Handy Apps may display this information publicly or provide it to others. In addition, Handy Apps may use your behavioral data and other data you provide to Handy Apps to customize its own advertisements on its site to its users. In this way we try to keep the majority of our services free. However, Handy Apps does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Password Locker discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Handy Apps’ behalf or to provide services available at Handy Apps’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Handy Apps’ services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Handy Apps will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Handy Apps discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Handy Apps believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Handy Apps, third parties or the public at large. If you are a user of Handy Apps website and have supplied your email address, Handy Apps may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Handy Apps and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Handy Apps takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Handy Apps uses cookies to help Password Locker identify and track visitors, their usage of Handy Apps website, and their website access preferences. Handy Apps visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Handy Apps’ websites, with the drawback that certain features of Handy Apps’ websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Privacy Statement Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Handy Apps may change its Privacy Statement from time to time, and in Handy Apps’ sole discretion. Handy Apps encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Statement.
This privacy policy statement applies to apps under Handy Apps, but are not limited to: Crypto Price IQ, Photo Locker, Video Locker, Expense IQ, Currency FX, Bills Reminder, Unit Converter, Loan Calculator IQ, Discount Calculator, Tip N Split.
