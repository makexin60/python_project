Why does Zenith collect data
                                                from its apps and games?
When you install and use Zenith mobile applications, we can collect and

                                                        continuously improve it
(e.g. identifying that a feature is annoying for users or that a
                                                        level is too difficult for most
                                                        gamers)

                                                                through Zenith apps for analytics purposes once you
                                                                express your consent through the

To serve advertising tailored to the preference and interests
                                                        of our users
and allow Zenith to continue to provide free services and
                                                        products
Legal basis – Express consent. Zenith only processes or
                                                                shares personal data collected
                                                                through Zenith apps for personalized advertising
                                                                purposes once you express your consent
                                                                through the pop-up notice included in one of our apps.
For all data processing activities that rely on users’ consent, you can
                                                withdraw your consent at any time by contacting our Data Protection
                                                Officer, stated in the contact section. In app/games published by SAS
                                                VOODOO, you can manually withdraw consent through the game by clicking
                                                "settings".
Please only note that in the case where you withdraw your consent or
                                                where you refuse to consent in the
                                                first place, you will still be served with advertising but that may be
                                                less relevant to you as it will
                                                not be tailored to your interests.
