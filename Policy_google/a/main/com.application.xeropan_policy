2.13.2.

4. Right to restriction of processing
4.1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain, at his or her request, the restriction of processing by the controller if one of the following conditions is met:
4.1.1. the data subject contests the accuracy of the personal data, in which case the restriction applies for a period of time which allows the accuracy of the personal data to be verified;
4.1.2. the data processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the data and requests instead the restriction of their use;

4.1.4. the data subject has objected to the processing; in this case, the restriction applies for the period until it is established whether the legitimate grounds of the Controller prevail over the legitimate grounds of the data subject.
4.2. Where processing is restricted, personal data, other than storage, may be processed only with the consent of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or of an important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.

6.2. In the event of an objection, the Controller may no longer process the personal data, unless it is justified by compelling legitimate grounds which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
7. Exclusion of automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling
7.1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.
8. Right to withdraw consent
8.1. The data subject has the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time, provided that consent is the legal basis for the processing. This shall not be more onerous for him/her than giving consent.
