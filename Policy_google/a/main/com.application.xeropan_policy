3.1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the Data Controller, upon his or her request, the erasure of personal data relating to him or her without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies and the Data Controller shall be obliged to comply with the data subject's request where one of the grounds applies:
3.1.1. the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;
3.1.2. the data subject withdraws the consent on which the processing is based and there is no other legal basis for the processing;
3.1.3. the data subject objects to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or where the processing would be for direct marketing purposes;
3.1.4. the personal data have been unlawfully processed;
3.1.5. the personal data must be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law applicable to the Data Controller;
3.1.6. personal data are collected in connection with the provision of information society services.
3.2. The erasure of data cannot be initiated if the processing is necessary:
3.2.1. to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;
3.2.2. to comply with an obligation under Union or Member State law that requires the controller to process personal data or in the public interest;
3.2.3. for preventive health or occupational health purposes, to assess an employee's ability to work, to make a medical diagnosis, to provide health or social care or treatment, or to manage health or social care systems and services, under EU or Member State law or under a contract with a health professional and the processing of that data is carried out by or under the responsibility of that professional, who is subject to a duty of professional secrecy under Union or Member State law or under rules laid down by the competent authorities of the Member States or by another person who is also subject to a duty of secrecy under Union or Member State law or under rules laid down by the competent authorities of the Member States;
3.2.4. in the public interest in the field of public health, such as protection against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring a high level of quality and safety of healthcare, medicines and medical devices, and on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for adequate and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, in particular professional secrecy;
3.2.5. on grounds of public interest in the field of public health and the processing of such data is carried out by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under Union or Member State law or the rules established by the competent authorities of the Member States, or by another person who is also subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under Union or Member State law or the rules established by the competent authorities of the Member States;
3.2.6. archiving in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes, where the right of erasure would be likely to render such processing impossible or seriously jeopardise it; or
3.2.7. to bring, enforce or defend legal claims.
4. Right to restriction of processing
4.1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain, at his or her request, the restriction of processing by the controller if one of the following conditions is met:
4.1.1. the data subject contests the accuracy of the personal data, in which case the restriction applies for a period of time which allows the accuracy of the personal data to be verified;
4.1.2. the data processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the data and requests instead the restriction of their use;
4.1.3. the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but the data subject requires them for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
4.1.4. the data subject has objected to the processing; in this case, the restriction applies for the period until it is established whether the legitimate grounds of the Controller prevail over the legitimate grounds of the data subject.
4.2. Where processing is restricted, personal data, other than storage, may be processed only with the consent of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or of an important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.
5. Right to data retention
5.1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain the personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided to the Controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format and to transmit those data to another Controller, without hindrance by the Controller, where the processing is based on consent or on a contract; and the processing is carried out by automated means.
5.2. The data subject has the right to request, where technically feasible, the direct transfer of personal data between Data Controllers. This right shall not apply where the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. The right to data portability shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
6. Right to object
6.1. The data subject shall have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to processing of his or her personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, or necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, including profiling based on those provisions.
6.2. In the event of an objection, the Controller may no longer process the personal data, unless it is justified by compelling legitimate grounds which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
7. Exclusion of automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling
7.1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.
8. Right to withdraw consent
8.1. The data subject has the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time, provided that consent is the legal basis for the processing. This shall not be more onerous for him/her than giving consent.
