This principle applies to the information that you as a Data Subject receive about the identity of the Data Controller and the purposes of the Processing, as well as to the additional information guaranteeing conscientious and transparent Processing.
2.1.3 Compliance with the third principle, namely to minimize data and limit the purposes and period of storage by the Data Controller, is ensured by collecting only those data that are absolutely necessary for the purposes and activities of the Data Controller and its compliance with the legal requirements, as they are processed only for specific, explicitly stated and legitimate purposes, and are not processed in a way incompatible with these purposes, and are stored for a period not longer than necessary or provided by the law.

14.1.3 Right to erasure (“to be forgotten”): you have the right to request the Data Controller to delete without undue delay the Personal Data that concern you, when they are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected and/ or processed; when you withdraw your consent, on which their processing is based and there is no other legal basis for it; when you object to their Processing for the purposes of direct marketing and there are no legitimate grounds for processing to take precedence; when your Personal Data is processed in violation of the principles outlined above; when it must be deleted in order to comply with a legal obligation for the Data Controller or the Personal Data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services. This right shall not apply to the extent that Processing is necessary: (a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; (b) for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller; (c) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health; (d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in so far as the right is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that Processing; or (e) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
14.1.4 Right to restriction of Processing: the Data Controller restricts the processing of Personal Data without deleting them when: (i) the accuracy of the Personal Data is disputed by you as a Data Subject and this cannot be verified, or (ii) Personal Data must be kept for evidentiary purposes.
14.1.5 Right to data portability: you have the right to receive the Personal Data concerning you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the Data Controller to which the Personal Data have been provided, when the Processing is based on a contractual obligation and is performed in an automated manner.

14.1.6 Right of objection: If you have consented to the Processing of your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object to this Processing at any time, including when it involves profiling. In any such case, the Processing of your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing is suspended.
14.1.7 In addition you have the right not to be the subject of a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal consequences for you and affects you significantly. In case you exercise this right, the Data Controller is obliged to apply appropriate measures to protect your rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, ensuring human intervention and giving you the right to express your point of view and challenge its decision.
14.2 As a Data Subject, you may exercise the rights above by submitting a written application to the Data Controller. The application can be submitted by mail (at the address of the Data Controller or by e-mail). The application must contain: (i) name, surname, habitual residence, IP address (if applicable); (ii) a description of the request; (iii) a preferred form of obtaining information in the exercise of rights; (iv) signature, date of filing of the application. When the Data Controller has reasonable concerns, it may request additional information needed to verify your identity. The Data Controller satisfies your requests completely free of charge within (1) month of receipt. The period may be extended by two (2) months when this is necessary due to the complexity or number of requests. Where requests from a Data Subject are manifestly unreasonable or excessive, in particular because of their recurrence, the Data Controller may: (i) charge a fee commensurate with the administrative costs of providing the information or correspondence, or of acting on the request, or (ii) refuse to act on the request. Each time the Data Controller refuses to accept an application submitted by you for the exercise of the rights above, you will receive a written refusal, as well as the reasons for it. In these and other cases, the Data Controller will also inform you of your right to appeal or seek a court redress.
14.3 A register that contains information on submissions, considerations, and responses to all Data Subjects` requests will be kept by the Data Controller.

In some cases the communication shall not be required, especially when: (i) we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the Personal Data affected by the Personal Data breach, such as encryption; (ii) we have taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to your rights and freedoms is no longer likely to materialize; (iii) it would involve disproportionate effort, in which case, you will be informed in an equally effective manner like via a public communication or other.
14.5 In case of a violation of your rights under GDPR you have the right to refer to the competent supervisory authority at your habitual place of residence within six (6) months as of the violation discovery, but not later than two (2) years from its occurrence.

This law provides additional protections to individuals under the age of 18 in California, including a right to be forgotten, which enable minors to remove their own posts (but not republications of their posts or posts about them by others). The Eraser Law also prohibits companies who operate websites or online services directed at minors from using the minor’s personal information to market or advertise certain enumerated products and services deemed potentially harmful for them.
