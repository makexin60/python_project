3.2 EGYM Fitness Hub
The EGYM Fitness Hub is a smart and digital training innovation that enables end-users to simplify their onboarding into the world of EGYM services at the fitness facility, including conducting tests and measurements, and is connected to all EGYM devices. This allows for fully automated adjustment of all EGYM strength training machines (see Section 3.2) to the user’s measurements, training goals, and needs, and stores test results and progress in the EGYM Fitness App (Section 3.4) and the EGYM Branded Member App (see Section 3.5), provided the end-user uses these services. The results are also used to create personalized training plans based on the end-user’s selected fitness goal.
The EGYM Fitness Hub, equipped with advanced 3D camera technology, captures and analyzes the physical attributes and performance of the end-user through self-service mode tests and detects and corrects any improper movements while performing predefined movement patterns. The EGYM Fitness Hub is connected to fitness carts from third-party providers, which offer additional measurements. Depending on the provider of the fitness scale, further data will be collected by the respective provider under their responsibility, and additional information can be found on the screen of the fitness scale connected to the EGYM Fitness Hub.
The measurement and test results are displayed to the end-user on the EGYM Fitness Hub screen, and they can be accessed later by the end-user through login with the RFID chip or fitness band on the EGYM Fitness Hub or in the EGYM Fitness App and/or EGYM Branded Member App.
Certain features within the EGYM Fitness Hub (e.g., Squat Feature) involve photographic recordings of your person, allowing you to view the recordings for personal posture correction after performing a movement sequence/test. The recordings are stored in your EGYM account, so you can also review them at later times, for example, for progress tracking on the EGYM Fitness Hub.
When using the EGYM Fitness Hub after prior registration on the Fitness Hub screen, we process your personal data in the form of your registration data (see Section 3.0), which enables login on the Fitness Hub. We also store data about your physical attributes such as gender, weight, and height; as well as results from strength and progress measurements on the Fitness Hub, including strength, cardio, metabolism (BMI, weight, body fat, body water, extracellular and intracellular water, basal metabolic rate, skeletal muscle mass) and flexibility (based on measurements of hip, hamstrings, chest, and neck after performing exercises on the Fitness Hub); the latter serves as the basis for visualizing your biological age (BioAge), a metric that compares the end-user’s biological age with their actual chronological age and provides a holistic assessment of physical condition and fitness level. Metabolism data comes from the smart body scales connected to the Fitness Hub (see above). Additionally, device settings (for EGYM strength machines) and training plans, heart rate and performance data, and your fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle building) are stored. When using specific features like the Squat Feature, photos of your person are also stored (see also above).
Please note that data related to your posture, strength, metabolism, cardio, flexibility, and the resulting BioAge metric, as well as heart rate and performance data, are considered health data. The processing of this health data is based on the explicit consent of the user in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) in conjunction with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a) GDPR, which is provided during registration for EGYM services. The user can withdraw consent at any time with future effect. However, the lawfulness of the data storage up to the withdrawal remains unaffected. Please note that, due to the broad interpretation of the term health data under GDPR, which includes not only training data or information about your BioAge but also details like your height or weight, meaningful use of our EGYM products will no longer be possible or feasible, and in the event of withdrawal of consent for the processing of health data, your EGYM account will be deleted. If you are unsure or have any questions, please feel free to contact us, for example, by email at datenschutz@egym.de."
3.3 EGYM
Power equipment
EGYM power equipment is both those marked with an EGYM logo and those of other brands with the EGYM training software. In order to be able to train on power or cardio equipment with the EGYM training software, an EGYM user profile is required (see 3.0. above).
3.3.1 Equipment settings
If necessary, the equipment settings are adjusted by the trainer at your fitness facility before the first workout. These equipment settings (gender, height, range of motion, weights) are stored so that they can be automatically adjusted to the user for all subsequent workouts on the equipment for that user and you do not have to apply any settings yourself. The legal basis for the processing of the aforementioned data is the fulfilment of a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR).
The processing of health data is based on the user's consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) in conjunction with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a) DSGVO. The user can revoke the consent at any time with effect for the future. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the storage carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation. Please note that in this case you will no longer be able to use the functionalities concerned.
3.3.2
Strength testing, storage of training data/training results (health data)
Training data (training device(s), weights, repetitions, distance and duration) is stored to enable strength testing and analysis of the training on the machines using the EGYM training software, which is designed to help you train ideally, taking into account your physical characteristics. In addition, training results can also be recorded and documented manually by yourself using the EGYM Fitness App (see section 3.3 below).
The processing of health data is based on the consent of the user in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) in conjunction with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a) GDPR. The user can revoke the consent at any time with effect for the future. However, the legality of the storage that has taken place on the basis of the consent up until the revocation is not affected by this. Please note that due to the broad interpretation of the term health data according to DSGVO, which already includes information such as your height or weight in addition to training data or information about your BioAge, a meaningful use of our EGYM products is no longer possible and feasible, so that we will delete your EGYM account in case of a revocation of your consent to the processing of health data. If you are not sure or have any questions about this, you are also welcome to contact us, for example, by email at datenschutz@egym.de.
3.4. EGYM Fitness App

You can of course deactivate the connection between your EGYM profile and your trainer's Trainer App at any time by unlinking it in your profile settings.
3.8 EGYM Genius
EGYM Genius is a feature of the EGYM platform that can be used by end-users within the EGYM Branded Member App in self-service mode after onboarding the end-user at the EGYM Fitness Hub. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent algorithms to personalize and optimize the training experience of the end-user and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the training through training plans tailored to the needs of the end-user. EGYM Genius takes into account the entire training area of the fitness facility and all digital/smart training devices available there, such as EGYM strength training machines or those from third-party providers, as well as analog training devices. EGYM Genius processes data from various sources, including EGYM strength machines, the EGYM Branded Member App, the EGYM Fitness Hub, and wearables you have explicitly connected, as well as data from an internal database operated by EGYM, which combines fully anonymized training data from end-users and evaluation data from sports science findings to create personalized training plans.
To create personalized training plans, EGYM Genius analyzes the training data of an end-user and dynamically adjusts the training plans. EGYM Genius considers and processes factors and data such as fitness level, progress, personal training goals such as muscle building, weight loss, rehabilitation, or endurance improvement, as well as user feedback. EGYM Genius evaluates the collected training data and provides direct feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the end-user’s training. The system can also detect weaknesses and suggest targeted exercises for the end-user. Progress is made visible to the end-user in the EGYM Branded Member App.
As part of the optional/voluntary creation of personalized training plans using EGYM Genius, we store data about your person/physical condition such as gender, weight, and height; the results of strength and progress measurements at the Fitness Hub, your BioAge, your fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle building), your training data (from EGYM strength machines or self-entered training in the EGYM Branded Member App), and fitness activities (e.g., activities entered by you in the EGYM Branded Member App inside and outside your fitness facility), data from compatible fitness trackers/wearables, and the personalized training plan created for you.
Please note that the processed data related to your BioAge, training activities, and results from strength and progress measurements are health data. The processing of this health data is based on the explicit consent of the user pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) in conjunction with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a) GDPR, granted during registration for EGYM services. The user can withdraw consent at any time with future effect, and for example, delete a training plan created using EGYM Genius.
3.9 Use of Anonymized Training Data for Statistical Purposes
We use the training data collected from our digital strength machines (EGYM strength machines), demographic data (age, gender, height), body measurements (weight, strength measurements, body fat measurements), end-user activities (e.g., exercises performed), metadata from our exercise database (e.g., which exercises activate which muscle groups), including health data, exclusively and fully anonymized for statistical analyses and store these anonymized data in a separate database.
The analysis and evaluation of anonymized data aims to generate general and aggregated insights (e.g., average training patterns, correlations between training and goal achievement) and improve our products and services. For example, insights from anonymized training data are used to generate personalized training plans via EGYM Genius for other users (see Section 3.8 above). The processing in the form of anonymization for statistical purposes is aimed solely at deriving general, aggregated insights. In no case will the data be traced back to individuals or result in individualized outcomes for the person whose data was anonymized.
We ensure that all data are fully anonymized before statistical analysis and storage. This means that under no circumstances can conclusions be drawn about the identity of the affected persons, and the anonymization cannot be reversed. The further processing of data collected through the use of EGYM services in the form of anonymization for statistical purposes is based on Art. 6 para. 4 GDPR in conjunction with Art. 5 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. For the further processing of health data in the form of anonymization for statistical purposes, the legal basis is Art. 9 para. 2 lit. j) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 5 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. Please note that the strict and complete anonymization of your data as an additional security measure ensures that no link to your identity can be made.
3.10 Use of Anonymized Data for Sports Science Studies
For the purpose of sports science studies, partly in collaboration with research institutions, universities, and institutes, we process anonymized and aggregated, that is summarized, user data about user training behavior to derive sports science insights, e.g., regarding training intensity and frequency, and publish studies. Your training data is fully anonymized, so EGYM cannot make any conclusions about individual users, and the anonymization cannot be reversed. Research institutions, universities, and institutes receive only anonymized data sets for evaluation.
For the further processing of health data in the form of anonymization for (sports) scientific research purposes, the legal basis is Art. 9 para. 2 lit. j) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 5 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. Please note that the strict and complete anonymization of your data as an additional security measure ensures that no link to your identity can be made."

Your consent will be obtained for the transfer of your gym data to your EGYM user profile in order to use the additional functions in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 a) GDPR.
4.3 Transfer/synchronisation of EGYM data to your fitness facility
In the reverse case of the provision of EGYM data (which will be processed within the scope of the contractual relationship with EGYM in accordance with clause 3 above) to your fitness facility, e.g. to enable your fitness facility trainer to display and analyse your training data and to display the results of health and strength tests, your BioAge etc. in the EGYM Trainer App for the purpose of optimal support by your fitness facility trainer, your prior express consent will also be obtained before the transfer of health data.
For the further processing of the data transferred by EGYM to your fitness facility including health data, for the aforementioned purposes, your fitness facility is the data fitness facility is the responsible party under data protection law.
Additional information for users in Switzerland: If you are a resident of Switzerland and use the EGYM Services in a physiotherapy practice, please note that your physiotherapy practice may also process the data provided by EGYM with your prior consent to create summary reports showing the improvement of objective measurements (weight, body fat percentage, resting pulse, maximum strength, etc.) based on EGYM products. ) based on the training with EGYM products are summarized, which may subsequently be shared by your physiotherapy practice with your doctor and health insurance company in order to check the possibility of a prescription for training and the assumption of (partial) costs by your health insurance company in Switzerland. You will receive further information on this and whether this applies to you directly from your physiotherapy practice in Switzerland. For the related processing of your data, including health data, your physiotherapy practice is exclusively responsible independently under data protection law.
4.4. Duplicate/Multiple User Accounts – Deletion (Outdated) Data
Please note that in some cases, two or more user accounts may be maintained in our systems for the same member/user. This may be due to the personal data stored by the fitness facility about you (see Section 4.1 regarding the data we process on behalf of the fitness facility), or data from your EGYM or EGYM-Wellpass user account (see Section 3.0 c)) or both.
We refer to this as a “duplicate account.” Such a duplicate account can lead to issues with your current user account, for example, not being able to train on EGYM strength machines or being unable to log in to our website or the Branded Member App with your user account.
Typically, such duplicate accounts are created, for instance, if you previously trained at a fitness facility, and your email address and name were used for your profile there, and now a new user profile is created with the same email address at your new fitness facility. The issue could also arise from a typo, meaning the fitness facility made an error when creating your user profile in our Trainer App, which causes it to differ from the data in their member management system. The same issue can occur if you originally created a user account in a Branded Member App for your fitness facility or as an EGYM-Wellpass member, and a new user account is created through your fitness facility’s member management software or via a website.
In all such cases, we do our best to preserve all data and information in your user account(s). However, sometimes this is not possible, and we may need to delete one of the user accounts to allow you to continue using your current user account. In such cases, we consider the activity in the account, e.g., which user account was last updated, contains more recent training data, or was last used, for example, on a strength machine or for check-in at the fitness facility. In these cases, we only delete the user account we are certain is no longer actively used by you (e.g., a user account linked to an old fitness facility that shows no activity or check-ins) or that contains less recent data/training data, so that you can use your current user account with, for example, your current settings for the EGYM strength machines. In this way, we ensure that the deleted data are always minimized and do not have any negative or permanent consequences for the use of your user account at the fitness facility or the use of our EGYM products both inside and outside the fitness facility. If the issue with the duplicate account relates to your EGYM-Wellpass account, we will delete the account that is not linked to EGYM Wellpass to ensure you do not experience problems with your Wellpass membership."
5. Data transfer to third parties / recipients, use of service providers
Your personal data will only be passed on or transmitted by us to third parties if this is necessary to fulfil the contract with you, if there is a legitimate interest on our part, if you have given your consent to do so and/or if we are obliged to do so by law or by official or court orders.
Your personal data will be transmitted by us to third parties in the cases and for the purposes described below:
E-mail dispatch service providers:
For the dispatch of our e-mails to you, e.g. transaction e-mails such as the dispatch of a registration or order confirmation and for the dispatch of a newsletter ordered by you, we use e-mail dispatch service providers who use your e-mail address on our behalf and only within the scope of our instructions on the basis of order processing agreements pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR for the purpose of sending the respective message, but not for other purposes and not for the e-mail dispatch service providers to contact you themselves.
Cloud and software providers/processors:
We also use service providers who provide web hosting services on our behalf and also use third-party cloud- or web-based software solutions that enable us to manage and host personal information in the cloud at external service providers to reduce the load on our own servers and to work effectively with new software solutions. We have concluded order processing agreements with the respective service providers to ensure that the respective service providers do not process the data for their own purposes, but only within the scope of our instructions and on our behalf. The legal basis for the use of the service providers is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR (processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data controller) in conjunction with Art. 28 GDPR (commissioned processing).
Some of the service providers employed by us who process personal data on our behalf and within the scope of our instructions as so-called processors pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR are located outside the EU/EEA. We will ensure that an adequate level of data protection is in place at the processor before transferring data to processors outside the EU/EEA. For processors in countries such as Canada and Israel, for example, this results from an adequacy decision of the EU Commission (so-called safe third countries),and for other processors by concluding the EU standard contractual clauses prior to the start of processing by the respective processor.
EGYM group companies:
We also use other companies in the EGYM Group as contract processors who also process personal data for us in accordance with the legal provisions on the basis of a contract processing agreement, e.g. in connection with the provision of development and support services for our services and applications.
Fitness facilities/trainers:
A transfer of data from EGYM to your fitness facilities/trainers will take place if you have expressly consented thereto, see also above section 3.7 (Trainer App) and section 4), if this is necessary for the performance of a contract concluded with you and/or insofar as there is a legitimate interest in this on the part of your fitness facility. If you use the EGYM Branded Member App, data will be shared with your fitness facility if this is absolutely necessary for the provision of the service requested by you, e.g. so that you can bindingly register for a course of your fitness facility, call up courses of your fitness facility or participate in a promotion/challenge of your fitness facility. Furthermore, as part of the use of the Branded Member App, data/information may also be shared with your fitness facility such as whether you are using the app as a member of the fitness facility, the date of the first login/last login, frequency of use and feedback/ratings on the app. The transfer of this data to your fitness facility is based on the legal basis of the legitimate interest of your fitness facility. The legitimate interest is to be able to track how many/which members actually use the Branded Member App, whether they are satisfied and/or use the app frequently, in order to be able to determine whether the economic investments in the Branded Member App are worthwhile for the fitness facility.
Other EGYM users/ social features
: If the user has explicitly activated this in the privacy section of his profile, the users can compare themselves with friends and other users at the fitness facility within the social features of EGYM and thus motivate themselves. For this purpose, the following information is available/visible to all other EGYM users at the same fitness facility in the "Ranking" section when activated by the user: user name or EGYM alias (if no user name is entered, the EGYM alias consists of the so-called local part of the email address, i.e. the part before the @ sign), profile picture, EGYM points, name of the fitness facility and whether the user is a trainer and/or EGYM Premium User. These details are not made searchable by public search engines. This function can be manually switched on and off at any time in the privacy section of the profile. You can also create your own fitness team by sending friendship requests to users who have also activated the social features or by accepting friendship requests from other users.
Manufacturer-connected devices with EGYM software
(e.g., LifeFitness cardio fitness equipment): There are fitness devices from other manufacturers that are equipped by EGYM with Smart Cardio software, allowing you to log in and train on these devices with your EGYM ID or RFID chip/armband. This applies, for example, to cardio fitness equipment from the manufacturer LifeFitness. In this case, the manufacturer of the fitness devices equipped with EGYM’s Smart Cardio software acts as a data processor under Art. 28 GDPR, meaning that the required personal data is processed by the manufacturer according to our instructions. The manufacturer of the fitness devices processes the following data about you on our behalf: date of birth, height, weight, gender, RFID ID, and preferred devices for the purpose of setting up the devices for your use. The manufacturers of the fitness devices may also use this data in anonymized form, which does not allow identification of you, for their own statistical purposes.
EGYM may also allow the user to publish information in their profile (e.g. training results) or share it with third parties in social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter etc.) by connecting the profile on EGYM with the social media account. This transfer of data initiated by the user is the sole responsibility of the user. EGYM assumes no responsibility for the third parties involved (e.g. Facebook) and their handling of the user's data.
6. Data security and encryption
Your personal data is securely transmitted by us using encryption. This applies to your purchase order as well as to the user login. EGYM only uses TLS 1.0 to 1.2 (Transport Layer Security) for communication between EGYM terminals and EGYM servers. A relapse to older versions is not possible. This also applies to the encryption (cipher) used, which uses PFS (Perfect Forward Security). EGYM also only uses HSTS procedures that are less than 1 year old. This encryption is commonly referred to as SSL (coding system). EGYM thus ensures maximum security during data transmission.
We secure our website and other systems and applications against data loss, destruction, access, modification or distribution of your data by unauthorised persons by means of appropriate technical and organisational measures.
7. Duration of storage
We adhere to the principles of data avoidance and data economy. We therefore only store your personal data for as long as this is necessary to provide the services you have requested or ordered (see in detail the services/services and uses listed in section 3), i.e. generally for as long as a contractual relationship exists with you and/or your consent has been given.
After discontinuation of the respective processing purpose or in the event of ending/termination of a contractual relationship or after revocation of your consent, the relevant data will be blocked or deleted by EGYM, unless further storage is necessary due to statutory storage obligations (e.g. according to the provisions of the German Commercial Code), with which we must comply.
8. Obligation to provide personal data
In order to be able to use the product/service you have requested (see the description of the respective services according to section 3), it is necessary to provide the personal data required for this purpose in order to conclude the contract or to provide the product/service you have requested.
The provision of data which is not absolutely necessary for the relevant conclusion of the contract or for the provision of the service/service you have requested is voluntary and can be recognised by the fact that the relevant input fields are marked as "optional".
Any non-supply of the data required for the conclusion of the contract or for the provision of the requested service could have the consequence that we are not able to provide the respective contractual service or service in accordance with the contract.
9. Non-existence of automated decision making
We draw your attention to the fact that when using the EGYM services and making use of our services, you will not be subject to a decision based exclusively on automated processing - including profiling - which has a legal effect on you or which significantly affects you in a similar way.
10. Use of cookies / tracking
For the use of cookies and tracking technologies, please see the separate information in our cookie policy.
The following guidelines apply to the use of tools and tracking technologies in our Branded Member app:
10.1 What do we use tools and tracking technologies for in the app?
We make use of tracking technologies when you use the app to enable you to access your user account, analyse and resolve app errors and stability problems, gain a better understanding as to how the app is used by the user, and to improve your user experience.
To this end, we make use of technologies from third-party providers listed by us under Item 2 and who act on our behalf within the scope of processing pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR, meaning that they only process data on our behalf and as instructed by us.
Some of the third-party service providers used by us and who, as processors pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR, process personal data on our behalf and as instructed by us, are based outside the EU/EEA, e.g. in the USA. Before transmitting data to processors outside the EU/EEA, we first ensure that the processor takes appropriate steps to safeguard data protection. This can be determined, for example, for processors in countries such as Canada and Israel by means of an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission (referred to as safe third countries) and for other processors by agreeing on standard EU contract clauses before the respective processors starts processing data.
The legal basis for using tracking technologies for the aforementioned purposes in our app is point (f) of Art. 6(1)(1) GDPR (processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interested pursued by the controller). For further details here, please refer to the individual tools mentioned below.
10.2. Tools and tracking technologies used
