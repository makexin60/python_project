Effective from:

Published at:
2024-04-24
Scope and purpose
This policy is applicable to the Processing of customers' Personal Data at all companies included in the Volvo Car Group ("Volvo Cars," "our," "us," or "we"). The purpose of this policy is to provide our current, former and potential customers (jointly referred to as "customers" or "you") with a general understanding of:
The circumstances under which we collect and process your Personal Data
The types of Personal Data we collect
The reasons for collecting your Personal Data
How we handle your Personal Data
Distribution of responsibility for the Processing of Personal Data between various legal entities at Volvo Cars, and
Contact details for us so you can receive information about and claim your rights in relation to our processing of your Personal Data.
This Customer Privacy Policy does not describe the processing of personal data performed by independent local representatives. For information on the processing of personal data for such entity, we refer you to the company in question.

This policy is updated continuously to reflect the measures taken by Volvo Cars in relation to your Personal Data.
Controller
Volvo Car Corporation (a Swedish legal entity with corporate registration number 556074-3089) is the Controller in relation to Processing of your Personal Data for research and development of new and current car models, and also for certain global services offered to customers. Furthermore, Volvo Car Corporation is Controller for any Processing of Personal Data in relation to the monitoring of the quality of the cars and any potential safety recalls, as well as to meet regulatory requirements.
Each national sales company within Volvo Cars is generally responsible for marketing, sales, and customer relations, as well as market-specific services on its market. The national sales company is the Controller for the Processing of Personal Data for these purposes. In markets without a national sale company, an importer usually has the same responsibility as a national sale company. Therefore, the importer is the Controller in these instances. Volvo Cars contractually requires its dealers and repairers to comply with rules concerning data protection. Note that Volvo Cars and its authorized dealers and repairers are separate legal entities and that we are generally not responsible if such dealers and repairers do not follow applicable laws. If you have questions regarding your dealer's or repairer's use of your personal data, please contact the dealer or repairer directly.

Principles of data processing
The Processing of your Personal Data forms an important part of our provision of products and services to you. We appreciate the trust you place in us when providing us with your Personal Data, and consider your privacy an essential part of the services we offer. In order to safeguard your personal data while increasing customer value and offering enhanced and safer driving experiences, we adhere to the following five general principles.
Freedom of choice
Your personal data belongs to you. We strive not to make any assumptions regarding your privacy preferences and aim to design our services so that you can choose whether to share your personal data with us.
Balance of interests
Where the Processing of your Personal Data is necessary for the pursuit of a legitimate interest, and where this interest outweighs the need to protect your privacy, we may process certain Personal Data without obtaining your consent if so permitted by law. In certain other situations, we may also process your Personal Data without your consent if so is required in accordance with applicable law. For more information, see the "
Consent
" section below.
Proportionality
Volvo Cars will only process our customers' Personal Data if it is adequate, relevant and necessary in relation to the purpose for which it has been gathered. We aim to anonymize your personal data when a function or service can be achieved with anonymized data. If we combine anonymized or non-personal data with your personal data, it will be treated as personal data for as long as it remains combined.
Transparency and security
Volvo Cars believes in being transparent about which Personal Data we process and for which purposes. To us it is also vital to protect your Personal Data, since one of Volvo Cars' core values is to protect what is important to you. On request, Volvo Cars will provide customers with further information regarding our processing and protection of your personal data.
Legal compliance
It is Volvo Cars' policy to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations governing privacy and data protection in each and every country where we operate. Where necessary, we will adjust our processing of your personal data as described in this policy to ensure legal compliance.
The personal data that Volvo Cars collects about you and the vehicle will be used:
To provide you with products and services, including to verify your eligibility for certain purchases and services as well as to offer you enhanced offers and experiences;
To inform you of updates to, or changes in, our products and services, including but not limited to changes to our terms and conditions and policies;
To inform you of new products, services and events;
To provide vehicle support and services (warranty service, recall information, etc.);
For product development purposes: for example, to improve vehicle performance, quality and safety;
To evaluate and improve our offerings to and communication with customers;
To comply with legal requirements or requests from lawful authorities;
To inform you about our products and services and identify those that may be of interest to you;
To carry out market research; and
For purposes of analysis and customer profiling (online and social included) done by ourselves and our chosen suppliers.

Data collection
You may provide us with information about you or your vehicle when utilizing Volvo Cars' services in or outside a vehicle or in other contacts with Volvo Cars: for example, through our websites or customer centers (in this context, please note that phone calls may be recorded, with your consent, for quality assurance purposes). We may also obtain such data from our authorized dealers and repairers and other third parties. Such data may include:
Your contact information (name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.);
Demographic information (age, marital status, household composition, etc.);
Vehicle information (vehicle identification number [VIN], model, date of purchase, service history, etc.);
Location data generated by your activities (navigation assistance, search queries, location sharing, etc.); and
Data pertaining to your purchase and use of our products and services (customer preferences and settings, purchase history, Volvo ID, etc.).
Your vehicle will also automatically collect data relating to the vehicle and its surroundings, primarily of a technical nature and not directly related to you as a person. Such data ("vehicle-recorded data") is typically connected to the vehicle identification number (VIN) of the vehicle and may therefore be traceable to you. Vehicle-recorded data may include:
Safety information (whether airbags or belt tensioners have been triggered, whether the doors and windows are locked or open, etc.);
System functionality status (of the engine, throttle, steering, and brakes, etc.);
Driving data (vehicle speed, brake and accelerator pedal use, steering wheel movement, etc.);
Location data (the position of the vehicle in case of an accident, etc.); and
Surroundings data (temperature outside the vehicle, images, etc.).
Information about certain Vehicle-Recorded Data is also included in the Owner's Manual.
We are particularly careful and apply additional measures if and when collecting and processing sensitive personal data, as required by applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, note that applicable law may require other kinds of data to also be treated as sensitive personal data.
Notice
Where reasonably practical or as required by applicable law, we will, in connection to collecting or registering your Personal data, provide you with (i) specific information as to the purposes of the Processing of your Personal Data, (ii) the identity of the Controller, (iii) the identities of any third parties to whom the data may be disclosed and (iv) other information that may be necessary to ensure that you are able to safeguard your rights.

or otherwise in an agreement which you enter into with Volvo Cars.
Consent
Where reasonably practical or as required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent prior to collecting or using your personal data. The request for your consent will be clear and specific and will provide you with a reasonable basis with which to make your decision. We will never take your consent for granted. Instead, we will make sure that you can consent in a clear and transparent manner. Your consent is voluntary and may always be revoked: for example, by terminating a particular service or contacting Volvo Cars at the address indicated in the "
Information and access
" section below. If you do not give your consent, it may not be possible to use services or parts of services.
Collection and Processing of Personal Data without Consent

When collecting or using vehicle-recorded data for these purposes, and for similar legitimate interests pursued by Volvo Cars, we will generally not seek your consent unless this is deemed necessary in the individual case or required by applicable law.
Third party applications
You may access applications and other services linked with the vehicle but provided by a third party, which may, for example, require transmission of location data and other Vehicle-recorded data to this third party. Volvo Cars is not responsible for the collection or use of Personal Data in applications or services provided by a third party and recommends that you carefully review applicable terms for (and any integrity policy related to) such applications or services before you use them. If you have questions concerning a certain third party's use of your personal data, please contact the third party directly.
International transfers
Volvo Cars may transfer your Personal Data to recipients in countries outside of the European Economic Area which may have differing data protection laws. This includes countries which the EU Commission does not consider to have an adequate level of protection for Personal Data. If this occurs, Volvo Cars will ensure there are legal grounds for the transfer, in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. You will also be informed about the legal grounds, what safeguards were implemented, and where you can obtain a copy of information on these safeguards.
Data use
For most Processing acts, you are able to terminate our use of your Personal Data by updating your preferences, terminating a particular service, revoking your consent to the processing by contacting Volvo Cars at the address indicated in the "
Information and Access
" section below, or as otherwise instructed by us. However, and unless otherwise provided in applicable law, you may generally not opt out of the processing of your personal data:
In relation to certain acts of collection and further processing of your vehicle-recorded data relating to safety, quality, and product improvement;
When we perform such processing in order to send you important notices, such as changes to our terms and conditions and policies or in case of product recalls; and
When we perform it in order to comply with our legal obligations.
Retention
We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or the purposes of which you have otherwise been informed. This means that when you have consented to our processing of your personal data, we will maintain the data for as long as the customer relationship lasts (and where applicable, until the expiration of the warranty period) or until you withdraw your consent. If you decide to end your customer relationship, we will retain the data for a period of five (5) years after which your data will be deleted. If we have not received your consent for Processing, the data will only be retained to the extent we are permitted to do so by law.
