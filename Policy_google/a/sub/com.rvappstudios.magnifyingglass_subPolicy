Privacy Policy for Kids' Games
Last updated February 27, 2024
RV AppStudios (referred to as 'we', 'us', 'our') operates the 'www.rvappstudios.com' website and specializes in creating games and applications ('apps') for mobile devices, web, and PC ('devices'). The terms 'you' or 'your' refer to any individuals or entities using our apps.
PROTECTING CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
All of our apps for kids are offered without third-party advertising, analytics plugins, and in-app purchases.
For all of our kids’ apps, user data and activities are only saved on the device in use and are never sent outside of this device. This includes activity and reports from the apps, which parents can download and view whenever they like.
We do include links to external activities in our kids’ apps, such as rate us, view our other apps, links for worksheets, and social media page links. These are all protected inside of sections of the app only parents can access by solving a childproof puzzle.
We do not collect or share any Personal Information, such as email addresses, birth dates or times, ages, names, phone numbers, addresses, etc., from users. Additionally, this webpage does not collect user data.
The only personally identifiable information we collect is when someone emails us for support. Any such personal information will never be shared with other entities. It will be retained only to resolve support requests and for future reference, such as if support is needed again. We can delete these emails at any time upon your request.
CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will post the updated Privacy Policy on this page. When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through prominent posts on our website or within our products.
