Privacy Policy
A visit to our website can result in the storage on our server of information about the access (date, time,
							page accessed). This does not represent any analysis of personal data (e.g., name, address or e-mail
							address). If personal data are collected, this only occurs – to the extent possible – with the prior
							consent of the user of the website. Any forwarding of the data to third parties without the express
							consent of the user shall not take place.
We would like to expressly point out that the transmission of data via the Internet (e.g., by e-mail) can
							offer security vulnerabilities. It is therefore impossible to safeguard the data completely against access 
							by third parties. We cannot assume any liability for damages arising as a result of such security
							vulnerabilities. This website used TLS/SSL to encrypt the data transfer between you and our servers to ensure
							privacy and integrity of the exchanged data.
The use by third parties of all published contact details for the purpose of advertising is expressly
							excluded. We reserve the right to take legal steps in the case of the unsolicited sending of advertising
							information; e.g., by means of spam mail.
