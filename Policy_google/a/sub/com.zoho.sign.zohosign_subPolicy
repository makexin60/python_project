Privacy Policy for California Residents
This Privacy Policy for California Residents is an adaptation of the general Privacy Policy for compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").
This Privacy Policy statement is made by the Zoho Group consisting of all the entities listed
here
(collectively, "Zoho", "we", "us" or "our").
Last updated on:
5th June 2023.
Zoho's Privacy Commitment
Zoho has worried about customer and user privacy for more than 25 years, long before it became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding to take such a position. We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.
The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to all Zoho websites that link to it. It also applies to the products and services provided by Zoho through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by Zoho on Zoho's online marketplace and in other third-party online marketplaces. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Part I – Information Zoho collects and processes as a business
This part deals with how Zoho collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of Zoho's products and services, and others who contact Zoho through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.
Part II – Information that Zoho processes as a service provider
This part deals with how Zoho handles data that you entrust to Zoho when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.
Part III – General
This part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as Zoho's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.

What information Zoho collects
We collect information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate purpose. Zoho will have information about you only if (a) you have provided the information yourself, (b) Zoho has automatically collected the information, or (c) Zoho has obtained the information from a third party. Below we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those three categories and the information collected in each one.

You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we don't require that information to sign up for an account. After signing up, you will have the option of choosing a security question and an answer to the security question — if you provide these, they will be used only while resetting your password.

Your rights under CCPA
CCPA provides you five rights, of which two are covered as part of the rights listed above. These two are: right to access of personal information and right to request deletion of personal information. The third is the right to opt-out of sale, which is redundant since we promise not to sell or monetize your data in any way. The fourth right available to you under CCPA is the right against discrimination because you exercised the rights available to you and the fifth is the right to protection against waiver of rights.
You can exercise the rights described above, by sending an email to

We endeavor to comply with a request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you, in writing, the reason for the delay.
Any information we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the request's receipt. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Retention of information
We retain your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. Sometimes, we may retain your information for longer periods as permitted or required by law, such as to maintain suppression lists, prevent abuse, if required in connection with a legal claim or proceeding, to enforce our agreements, for tax, accounting, or to comply with other legal obligations. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete or anonymize your information from our active databases. We will also securely store the information and isolate it from further processing on backup discs until deletion is possible.
Part II – Information that Zoho processes as a service provider

Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy for persons in South Africa is an adaptation of the general Privacy Policy for compliance with the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA).
This Privacy Policy statement is made by the Zoho Group consisting of all the entities listed
here
(collectively, "Zoho", "we", "us" or "our").
Last updated on:
5th June 2023.
Zoho’s Privacy Commitment
Zoho has worried about customer and user privacy for almost 25 years, long before it became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding to take such a position. We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.
The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to all Zoho websites that link to it. It also applies to the products and services provided by Zoho through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by Zoho on Zoho’s online marketplace and in other third-party online marketplaces. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:
Part I – Information Zoho collects and processes as a responsible party
This part deals with how Zoho collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of Zoho's products and services, and others who contact Zoho through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.
Part II – Information that Zoho processes on your behalf as an operator
This part deals with how Zoho handles data that you entrust to Zoho when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.
Part III – General
This part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as Zoho's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.
Part I – Information Zoho collects and processes as a responsible party
What information Zoho collects
We collect information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate purpose. Zoho will have information about you only if (a) you have provided the information yourself, (b) Zoho has automatically collected the information, or (c) Zoho has obtained the information from a third party. Below we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those three categories and the information collected in each one.
Information that you provide us
i.
Account signup
: When you sign up for an account to access one or more of our services, we ask for information like your name, contact number, email address, company name and country to complete the account signup process. You'll also be required to choose a unique username and a password for accessing the created account. You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we don’t require that information to sign up for an account. After signing up, you will have the option of choosing a security question and an answer to the security question — if you provide these, they will be used only while resetting your password.
ii.
Event registrations and other form submissions:
We record information that you submit when you (i) register for any event, including webinars or seminars, (ii) subscribe to our newsletter or any other mailing list, (iii) submit a form in order to download any product, whitepaper, or other materials, (iv) participate in contests or respond to surveys, or (v) submit a form to request customer support, get a quote or to contact Zoho for any other purpose.
iii.
Payment processing
: When you buy something from us, we ask you to provide your name, contact information, and credit card information or other payment account information. When you submit your card information, we store the name and address of the cardholder, the expiry date and the last four digits of the credit card number. We do not store the actual credit card number. For quick processing of future payments, if you have given us your approval, we may store your credit card information or other payment information in an encrypted format in the secured servers of our Payment Gateway Service Providers.
iv.
Testimonials
: When you authorize us to post testimonials about our products and services on websites, we may include your name and other personal information in the testimonial. You will be given an opportunity to review and approve the testimonial before we post it. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at
privacy@zohocorp.com

The data may either be stored on our servers when you use our services, or transferred or shared to us as part of a request for technical support or other services.
Information from mobile devices
: When you elect to allow it, some of our mobile applications have access to the camera, microphone, call history, contact information, photo library, files and other information stored on your mobile device.

In keeping with Zoho's promise not to exploit your data in a way that is not respectful of your privacy and confidentiality expectations, we make only the following limited use of service data for these technologies: (i) using anonymized crops of service data to improve accuracy of the algorithms; and (ii) using your organization's data for developing models specific for your organization. Our automation and artificial intelligence technologies are mostly powered by our own organization's data such as internal communications, communications with customers and internal documents as well as free and paid external sources.

Privacy
At Zoho, we treat your data just like we treat our own: responsibly. The best testament to this commitment is our track record. Twenty-five years in, we continue to keep this promise to our customers.
Privacy has a lot to do with choosing a business model. We chose one that is not in conflict with protecting your information. Our business model is simple: we offer incredible technology at extremely affordable prices. When you find value in what we offer, you pay us for it. We do not have any hidden agendas or back-end deals with advertisers.
We don’t own your data, you do.
We will never sell your data
We will never do advertisements
Business Model & Privacy
No ad-based business model
Online advertising and user privacy do not mix.
We shunned the advertisement-based business model long before privacy laws came into effect. We have priced our software subscriptions attractively for our customers and appropriately for us to keep building world-class software and delivering solid customer support. This has always been our approach. Even our free software services don't host ads.
learn more
No double-dipping
We are transparent in our business model and we treat our customers like family.
We do not want to make money in any way that compromises the trust our users have in our service. There are growing examples in SaaS industry where "backdoor deals" are being cut between technology providers and service vendors that violate the sanctity of customer data. We have taken a stand against this.
learn more
Tracking & Privacy
No Adjunct surveillance
User tracking (to serve ads) has turned into a full on surveillance.
This trend started with B2C services but has started carrying over to the B2B domain as well. At Zoho, we are taking a stance against adjunct surveillance. What does that mean? When you use Zoho products, we do not allow surveillance companies to track you. We have also removed all non-essential or intrusive third-party trackers from our websites. We conduct regular audits to sustain the highest levels of privacy.
learn more
Data Protection & Encryption
Security first
We protect all customer data transmitted to our servers over public networks using strong encryption tools.
We mandate all connections to our servers use Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2/1.3) encryption with strong cyphers. This is for all connections including web access, API access, our mobile apps, and IMAP/POP/SMTP email client access.
We encrypt customer data at rest using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). We own and maintain the keys using our in-house Key Management Service (KMS). We provide additional layers of security by encrypting the data encryption keys using master keys which are well protected.
Encryption Whitepaper
Infrastructure & Privacy
Owning the full stack
We own all the core aspects of our technology stack.
This not only helps us deliver superior customer experience but also provides a much-needed assurance for our customers. Our customers need not worry about any competitor gaining "backdoor analytics" about how their service is performing. We take care to nurture the relationship with our customers and believe our users' trust is a truly non-negotiable currency. The few instances where we use third-party integrations to provide service enhancements, we inform our customers.
Non-reliance on ad-providers
We are not in the game to gain monetarily from our user behavior.
There are no advertisement providers in our network. Reliance on online ads compromises the trust between the service provider and the customer. At a service level, product teams track usage of features in order to provide better service and keep improving our offerings. We are committed to this approach.
Staying Private & Privacy
No investor pressure
We are in charge of our own destiny, and that's a freedom we want to keep.
We are a privately-held, bootstrapped company. We plan to remain this way. We don't have investors nor Wall Street on our back. We plan to keep it this way. This keeps us liberated from external pressure and allows us to make decisions in the long-term interest of our customers and employees.
More values over money
We are driven by what is morally correct.
Throughout our journey, we have never hesitated in choosing what is right over what is instantly profitable. This is a core value of our organization. We are happy to grow at whatever pace our destiny allows us and we are in no hurry at all. With no investors to answer to and no external stakeholders to deal with, we can promise we will not waver from the path we have chosen.
Trust & Commitment
25 Years to prove it
Zoho's journey has been a long time in the making.
We are not a magical unicorn like you find in fantasy tales. We believe in Main Street capitalism. We believe in investing time and effort in building user relationships and sustaining them. We want our customers to succeed as much as we do, and even more. During the last 25 years of our journey, we stayed true to who we are and earned the trust of our early customers. Many of them are still with us. We see them as a part of our family.
Commitment to Privacy
We believe that we don't need the law to catch up with what we do to decide what is acceptable or not.
It is a very straightforward call. Our customers pay us for our service. There is no question of violating their trust. We don't want to throw a bunch of legal jargon at you. We made a decision on what is morally acceptable vs legally acceptable. Trust is built over the long haul. One has to earn and keep that trust. We hope to earn your trust too.

This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fuelling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.

Does Zoho comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield or Data Protection Framework (DPF)?
We've implemented data localization in Europe for our EU clientele's service data processing, ensuring that their service data is processed within the European boundaries, pursuant to the requirements of the new Standard Contractual Clauses and our operational efficiencies.
To address the transfer of data between EU and other countries in some rare occasions, we have adopted the new Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as our transfer basis. Given the frailty and impending challenges in the recently released EU-US Data Protection framework, we would continue to depend on the SCC route for cross-border transfers.
