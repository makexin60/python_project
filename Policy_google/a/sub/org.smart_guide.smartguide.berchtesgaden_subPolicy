,

or

("Website"); or
our content management system ("CMS").
Information we collect about you
We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so – for example, to provide our services, to communicate with you or to make our services better.
SmartGuide provides mainly two kinds of services: it delivers multimedia guides to users and it allows people to create multimedia guides. We collect different types of data for different purposes, depending on how you use our services.
​
1. Data collected if you use our Website
If you use the Website, your browsing history and information on your browser and your operating system is collected through Google Analytics. SmartGuide can use this personal information to suggest information to you; to analyze the use of the Website; and to protect, adjust and update SmartGuide's services.
When you visit our Website or use our Application, some information is automatically collected. This may include information such as the operating system (“OS”) running on your device, internet protocol address (“IP Address”) (which may be used to obtain your geolocation), access times, browser type, language settings of the OS and the website you visited before our Website. We also collect information about how you use our Website, including the elements you have interacted with, metadata and other details about these elements, clicks, change states and other user actions.
​
2. Data collected if you use our Application
If you want to use our Application to listen to multimedia guides, you can do so without creating an account.
The Application may offer the option to create a user account. If so, you will be asked to provide your personal details, such as name and email.
Some information is automatically collected when you use the Application, such as: your browsing and usage history within the Application, IP Address, browser type, your mobile device and OS.
The Application also collects precise information about the location of your device. It tracks your path, the places you visited and your interactions with the user interface. We use your location information to provide requested location services and learn your travel habits to provide you with tailor-made offers based on your requirements. We only collect photos, videos and comments you directly share with us via the Application.
SmartGuide may also process information collected via the Application to share aggregated information with certain content providers. It will, however, not be possible for content providers to identify particular users from this aggregated data.
If you use the in-app payment system to purchase content, the applicable platform provider (Google, Apple or Windows) will collect data on the payment in accordance with its privacy policy. SmartGuide will obtain from Google, Apple or Windows information on which content you purchased, and use this information to handle its payments to content providers.
​
3. Data collected through our CMS
As noted, it is also possible to upload multimedia guides and other information for publication via our CMS. In order to do so, you must create an account, which requires you to provide your name, email address where we can reach you and other personal details.
After logging in and registering as a so-called 'content provider' in the CMS you can submit additional information.
The main function of the CMS is to allow you to upload information. If the content you upload contains personal information of you, we assume that you agree to the processing of this information in line with this Privacy Policy. If you plan to upload personal information of others and there is a significant risk that permission would be required for the processing described in this document, please obtain permission for this.
If you use our CMS, your browsing history, IP Address, information on your browser and your OS is collected through Google Analytics.
SmartGuide can use this personal information to develop and offer content for our Application; to analyze the use of the CMS; to communicate with you about the CMS and to respond to any complaints and/or questions; and to protect, adjust and update SmartGuide's services.
Please note that most of the information you provide through the CMS, such as your name and the uploaded content, will be made publicly available mainly through our Application in the course of the publication of your contribution.
Access to your profile on the Website is only possible after entering your login and personal password. It is essential that you do not disclose your login information to third parties. SmartGuide does not assume the responsibility for any misuse of passwords.
​
​
4. Data collected for communicating with you
SmartGuide may process your e-mail address for the purpose of distribution of generic (non-personalized) commercial communications relating to SmartGuide own products and services (e.g., Website, Application or CMS) in case you did not decline such communications.
If you do not agree to this processing, please inform us via
support@smart-guide.org
and SmartGuide will not process your personal data for these purposes. Also, an opt-out option is provided in every e-mail that SmartGuide sends you.
SmartGuide may also use tools to create and present personalized offers (content that better matches your preferences and interests) based, for example, on your age group or geographical location. For this purpose, SmartGuide may use data of your purchase history or activity on the Website and within the App or CMS which contain information about browsing (including your activity on social networks, if allowed through cookies or similar technology). The processing of your personal data for the purpose of personalized (profiled) offers is carried out only on the basis of a consent; such consent may be revoked at any time.
​
How we use information about you
SmartGuide relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:
provide, maintain and improve our services (for instance we cannot provide the services unless we collect and use your location information);
where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims;
where necessary for the purposes of SmartGuide’s legitimate interests;
research and develop new services;
suggest information to you, i.e. send you technical notices, updates and other support and administrative messages (in particular on the basis of your location);
provide customer service or respond to any complaints and/or questions you might have;
communicate with you about SmartGuide and its products, services, offers, promotions and events or provide other news and information we think might be of interest to you;
monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with provision of our services (including by means of Google Analytics);
personalize the services and provide advertisements, content and features that match user profiles or interests;
keep the services safe and secure (i.e. to protect against fraud, spam and abuse etc.); and
where you have consented to the processing, which you can revoke at any time.
How we share information about you
We do not sell your private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
Subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors. We may disclose information about you to provide products and services to you to assist those who help us in designing and operating the Website, the Application or the CMS or help us analyze collected data. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
Service providers. We may work with analytics companies, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis.
Law, harm, public interest, defense of own rights. We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request on account of national or international laws as well as when SmartGuide considers it necessary to do so in order to defend its own rights.
Business transfers. If SmartGuide is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices you may have regarding this information
Aggregated or de-identified information. We may publish aggregate statistics on the use of the Application (including location data), the Website and the CMS to others. For example, we may choose to publish statistics regarding how many registered SmartGuide users live in Germany versus how many live in France. This data is sufficiently aggregated so as to be anonymous.
With your consent. We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction.
When using services of personal data processors, SmartGuide concludes relevant data processing agreements. Personal data may also be transferred to companies with their registered offices in countries which do not provide an adequate level of protection according to the Regulation. In these cases, SmartGuide concludes standard contractual clauses for the transfers of personal data approved by the European Commission with the recipients in order to ensure an adequate level of personal data protection.
