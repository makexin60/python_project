Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:
When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish. We may also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We process your email address and password because you use your email address and password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address and password for this purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you enable two-factor authentication, we process your mobile phone number or email address to send the security code via SMS or email. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you reside in mainland China, we process your mobile phone number for purposes of real name authentication.
(b) We also process your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on our websites or apps or engage with other users. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is our legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other users.
(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receive direct marketing information from us, we will also process your email address or other account identifiers for the purpose of sending you marketing communications (e.g., emails, push notifications) about our products, services, and apps, as well as newsletters. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your
preferences
in your account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from us are based on the preferences you provide in your account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your  account, and any subscriptions included in your account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is our legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails. If you reside in mainland China, we may use your mobile phone number to send you marketing communications via SMS.
(d) We also process your email address to associate it with your account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.
(e) We also process your email address to notify customers when they have violated our terms. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in ensuring a quality experience for all customers and ensuring adherence to our terms.
Personal data that is processed when you sync your Garmin device:
When you sync your device directly or through a compatible Garmin app, we log data about the transmission, such as the IP address used when syncing, the sync time and date, crash/diagnostic logs, geographic location of the device, information about your device, information about the network used to sync (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular), and device battery level.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process this information to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues.

We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues and capture information relating to the support or service issue. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys. With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process this information to provide you with customer and product support, to monitor the quality and types of customer and product support we provide to our customers, and to facilitate repairs, returns, or exchanges. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is our legitimate interest in providing quality product support. The legal ground for signing in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue is your consent, which you may withdraw.
Personal data that is processed when you purchase a product, service, or subscription:
If you purchase a product, service, or subscription on a Garmin website or app or through customer support, then we will collect your name, address, email address, and telephone number and other information needed for billing in your jurisdiction. We do not view or store your payment card information, which is handled by third-party service providers.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We collect your name, mailing address, and telephone number so we can process your order and fulfill your purchase. The legal ground for processing your name, mailing address, and telephone number for these purposes is performance of a contract. We also process your personal data as part of our fraud detection processes, which may include the use of personal data related to the purchase, delivery, or use of products, services, or subscriptions as needed to investigate requests or claims. The legal ground for processing your personal data for that purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting us and our customers from attempts to engage in fraudulent transactions. If you reside in mainland China and provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from us, we will also process your telephone number to send you marketing communications.
Personal data that is processed when you purchase a product in a Garmin store:
When you purchase a product in a Garmin store, we may collect your name, address, telephone number, other contact information, or purchase details, such as invoice number or products purchased.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We process this information to generate an invoice in our systems for tax reporting purposes or upon your request. The legal ground for processing your information for generation of an invoice for tax reporting purposes is fulfillment of a legal obligation. The legal ground for processing your information for generation of an invoice at your request is performance of a contract.
Personal data that is processed when you use our live location-based services:
If you choose to use location-based services, such as weather, on your device or app, then the physical location of your device or connected mobile device will be collected in order for us or our providers to provide you with such location-based services.

PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
This data is aggregated with data from other consenting users and is used to enhance the quality of our products, services, and apps and the traffic, parking, and other features enabled by us or third parties. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is your consent, which you may withdraw at any time within the settings of your Garmin device or app.
Personal data that is processed to address fraud and abuse:
We take steps to identify, detect, and mitigate fraud and abuse on our services, websites, and apps. If we suspect a fraudulent request or claim has been made relating to your account or device, we may process data relating to the device(s) associated with your account, basic account information such as email address, name, phone number(s), and mailing address(es), or our communication history with you in order to adequately investigate the request or claim. We may process content that you have contributed to your account, such as activities, photos, comments, and reviews, to develop and test measures to help identify, detect, and mitigate disruption and damage to our services, websites, and apps potentially caused by or related to such content, to enforce our terms of use, to identify and remove inappropriate, harmful, or abusive content, and for related purposes.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND:
We perform these processing activities to protect the interests of Garmin, its customers, and other stakeholders against fraud, breach of contract, and other harmful or unlawful actions.  The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in reducing fraud and abuse perpetuated through the use of, or in connection with, our products and services.
