Privacy Policy
Healthy Is Wellness Consumer Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 12, 2023
Healthy Is Wellness, LLC (“HIW”, “we” or “us”) offers in-person health and wellness coaching utilizing fast, medical-grade assessments integrated with our proprietary technology.  Our services include body composition analysis, over-the-counter blood testing, wellness coaching, and movement and performance assessments.  We offer two technology platforms that collect and facilitate the processing of personal information from users:
the HIW mobile application (the “App”)
and
the HIW website (the “Website”).
The
HIW App
is an easy and convenient method of maximizing the benefits of the HIW system, allowing users to review their assessment results off-site, track their progress with pathways and challenges, and set personal goals. Users looking for the convenience of personal telecoaching services can purchase a Telecoaching Membership through the HIW App, a new offering that will allow you to schedule telecoaching sessions at your convenience.
The features available through the HIW App all require the collection of personal information about you, including your health and your lifestyle.
However, the type and extent of the information we collect will depend on the degree of your interaction with the app.
Members who are receiving in-person assessments and wellness coaching are free to decide whether to use the HIW App to track their goals and monthly challenges. If you do not use this feature, the information collected about you consists of what you provided during the registration process and your interactions with the app, which we use to improve its functionality and develop new products and services.
The HIW App is not equipped with any form of sensor and cannot collect health data unless you choose enter such data manually.
Through the HIW App, we offer our members the option of purchasing Telecoaching Membership. A Telecoaching Membership entitles you to one or more live and interactive telecoaching sessions with a HIW Wellness Coach, conducted telephonically or via video conferencing. During the purchasing process, you will be prompted to provide identifying, contact, and payment information, all of which we share with our third party payment processors. All telecoaching sessions are scheduled though the HIW App, providing us information about which Wellness Coaches you have consulted, as well as the times and dates of those sessions. HIW does not record or broadcast telecoaching sessions and we do not create any records concerning the content of your communications with a Wellness Coach. We may ask your permission to allow one of our supervisors to monitor the call for training purposes.
The
HIW Website
has been designed for marketing and outreach purposes only.  You cannot access any of our assessments or contact your health coach through the website.  The contact forms provided as part of the Website’s functionality are intended solely for marketing queries
.  You should not submit any information relating to your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition through our Website.
Further, to the extent the Website enables any communications with us, those submissions are routed to our Marketing and Sales departments.
You cannot use the Website to contact a coach and should not submit any personal information through the Website.
We do not maintain copies of your assessment or test results in hard copy.  All personal information and health data that we collect is maintained in electronic form only, accessible for review through the HIW App.  If we create a hard copy record of your assessment or test results during an event, we will provide that to you at check-out for your personal use.
Please note that HIW is not a health care provider subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).  Although we collect and maintain personal health information about you, we do not engage in electronic transactions subject to regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services.  As a result, the personally identifiable health data we collect about you does not constitute “Protected Health Information” subject to HIPAA unless we are acting as a Business Associate to a covered entity.  If you are receiving the Services due to your relationship with a covered entity – a healthcare provider, health plan, or health care clearinghouse – our use of your data is subject to the terms of our contract and the covered entity’s Notice of Privacy Practices.
This policy (our “Privacy Policy”) describes the categories of information we collect, the means we use to collect that data, and your rights as a consumer under federal and state law.
Personal Information We Collect
The data we collect depends on the extent of your interactions with our App and/or our Website, the features you use, and applicable law.  The data we collect can include the following:
Individual Identifiers and Contact Information.
Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, internet protocol (IP) address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.
HIW Account and Password Information.
User account log-in for the App, in combination with a user password.
Demographic Data.
Information about your age, gender, country, and preferred language.
Business Affiliation.
Data associating you with a company or business, such as a business name in your IP address.
Insurance Plan and Carrier.
Data associating you with a specific insurance plan or carrier, such as your plan number.
Health Data.
During an HIW coaching event, we offer users a variety of wellness assessments.  We use these assessments to build a picture of your overall health and provide you recommendations for addressing areas of potential concern.  Our assessments utilize medical-grade technology and over-the-counter blood testing, and can provide the following data about you:
Body Composition Information.
We use the InBody line of body composition analyzers to gather measurements of your visceral fat, muscle percentage, body fat percentage, and edema index.  These measurements are linked to common ailments and can increase your susceptibility to disease.  We utilize a custom API with InBody to collect body composition measurements directly from the device.  Users can view their results through the App.
Wellness Score.
Based on your body composition results, we will assign you a Wellness Score expressed as a number between 1 and 100.  Our wellness coaches will use your wellness score to assess your overall risk, both individually and in the context of a larger pool of participants.
Blood Test Results.
As a CLIA-waived facility, we offer over-the-counter blood testing for HbA1c (hemoglobin), lipids, and various micronutrients (all blood testing is subject to availability and the schedule applicable to your membership).  Blood tests are performed by our coaches on-site, during an event, with results either available on the spot or after processing by the manufacturer of the test.  Depending on how the test is processed, your results will be available: (i) during your appointment; (ii) through the HIW App, which you can download and view at any time; or (iii) during a follow-on appointment, at which time you can discuss the results with your Wellness Coach.
Movement Analysis.
We use the Sparta Science force plate to analyze fall risk and force creation through (i) sway, control, and stability scoring (the “Balance Test”), and (ii) load, explode, and drive scoring (the “Jump Test”).  These measurements are collected directly from the force plate using a Sparta Science API.  Users can view their results through the App.
C
ognitive Assessment.
We use Cognivue’s proprietary technology to assess several aspects of cognitive function including memory, visuospatial, executive function, reaction time, and processing speed. These assessments are utilized to help you visualize your performance in various cognitive areas and to identify changes in performance over time.
Objective Assessments.
In addition the assessments described above, we routinely utilize new or tailored objective assessments during our coaching events, such as blood pressure measurements and grip strength analysis.  We take these measurements in-person and on-site, with a hard copy of the results provided to you at the time of testing or upon check-out.  HIW does not maintain any hard copy records of your health data, but will upload the results to your online profile.  You can access your results and track your progress through the App.
Surveys and Questionnaires.
We routinely use surveys and questionnaires to help our members select personal goals, pathways and challenges.  Use of these tools will result in the collection of information about your general health, lifestyle choices, barriers to progress, and accelerators.  Taken together, these responses help our coaches tailor their advice to your specific needs and challenges, but can also be used to gain inferences about your lifestyle and health.
Inferences about Your Health.
To allow us to track your progress, we combine your individual assessment results in a single database.  Over time, the information in our database will allow our coaches to make inferences about your overall health and lifestyle choices.  We currently use this information for several purposes: (i) to provide you with specific recommendations about challenges that may be most effective for achieving your goals; (ii) if the services are being provided by a third party payer, such as your insurance company or an employer, we will provide monthly participation reports by individual as a means of evaluating the services; (iii) improving and refining the services and developing new assessments; and (iv) providing reports and statistics on the overall characteristics of a payer’s population using de-identified and aggregated information.  In certain cases, we may agree to share or sell health data to the entity that is providing the services to our users.  In such cases, you will be asked for your consent before any sale or sharing of your information takes place.
Sensitive Personal Information.
We may collect sensitive personal information from you concerning your family history, background, and economic circumstances as part of a social determinants of health initiative.   Social determinants of health describe the conditions that surround you in your daily life, affecting a wide range of health, functioning and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.
HIW does not routinely collect social determinants of health data.  However, you may be asked if you would like to provide this information: (i) at the request of the corporate or institutional client that is paying us to provide the services to you; or (ii) as part of a larger study or initiative carried out by HIW.
In such cases, we will collect your responses only if you affirmatively elect to provide the information and will de-identify your data before sharing it with a third party.
Pathways and Challenges.
You can use our app to choose one of eleven different pathways that correspond to your personal health goals.  These pathways target a specific health risk or area of concern which, when coupled with up to ten specific challenges designed to address those risks, can be used to infer information about your health and lifestyle.
Body Composition Goals.
Through the App, you can set a weight or body fat percentage goal along with associated goal dates.  If you participate in a body composition analysis during the allotted time window, those results will be automatically tracked as progress towards your goal.
Usage Data.
Data generated by your activity on the App.  This can include data you provide in order to make use of the App and its features (like search queries), as well as data we generate based on your activity on the App (such as error reports).
Interactions.
Data about your interactions with the App and its features, including the amount of time you spend on the App, the features you used, and search queries that you submit.
Device and Configuration Data.
Data about your device and your device configuration, such as the domain name of your Internet Service Provider, the Internet Protocol address assigned to the computer by which you are connected to the Internet, the name and version of your Web browser, and your computer’s operating system and platform.

Our Sources of Personal Information
Individual Members.
We collect personal information, including health data and inferences drawn therefrom, from the members receiving our services.  We collect assessment and test results on-site during a HIW event, as well as any information that is provided by a member through the HIW App off-site.
Visitors to Our Website.
We collect the personal information you provide to us through our Website, either through a direct communication with our company or by interacting with our Website and advertisements.
Your Sponsoring Organization.
We may collect personal information about you from the organization that has contracted with us to provide the services to you (your “
Sponsoring Organization
” or “
Group
”), generally as part of an employee benefit plan, health or insurance plan, wellness initiative, or other benefit.  The personal information we receive may include identifying information, demographic information, claims information, employment information, and health data.  Each organization’s collection of personal information is subject to their own privacy policy (or Notice of Privacy Practices, if a HIPAA covered entity).  If you are receiving the HIW services due to your relationship with a sponsoring organization, you may wish to consult that organization’s policy regarding the sharing of your personal information with service providers or business associates.
Assessment APIs.
We utilize APIs to collect assessment data directly from the InBody body composition analyzer and the Sparta Science force plate.  When a member uses either device during an HIW event, the results are automatically transmitted to HIW and added to our database.
Manual Assessments and Blood Tests.
During an HIW event, our coaches perform additional assessments and simple over-the-counter blood testing.  The results of these tests are either available immediately or within minutes.  All results are provided to members in person and on-site in hard copy, then uploaded to our database by a coach on-site.  We do not maintain or store hard copy assessment and testing results.
Mobile Payment Processing Platforms.
We may utilize one or more payment processing platforms to process consumer payments for the services.
How We Use Personal Information
To Provide the HIW Services to You.
Our proprietary coaching methodology pairs objective assessment results with subjective, interactive wellness coaching, delivered in-person or remotely. Members are offered the opportunity to participate in convenient, on-site events in which they can participate in assessments and meet with a coach in-person to discuss their goals and refine their plan. Those members that have elected to purchase a telecoaching membership can schedule their sessions via the HIW App and consult a wellness coach telephonically or via video conferencing. Between appointments, members stay engaged by using the HIW App to set goals, track their progress, and complete challenges. We use personal identifying information, sensitive lifestyle information, and health data to customize our feedback, provide personalized coaching, and track results.
To Provide Data Processing and Analytics to Your Sponsoring Organization.
When the services are offered to you as a part of a benefits program, wellness initiative, or other form of incentive by a third party payer (your “
Sponsoring Organization
”), we may use your personal information, including but not limited to your health information, to provide data processing and analytics services to that organization.  The purposes of such processing include administration of the organization’s benefits or incentive program(s), tracking and analysis of participation and engagement metrics, data aggregation services (in which the data we collect from you is paired with additional information about you provided by the Sponsoring Organization), statistical analysis to measure the impact of the services on various risk factors at an individual and group level, data deidentification, and, to the extent authorized by your Sponsoring Organization, the preparation of limited or pseudonymous data sets.
As a HIPAA Business Associate.
If your Sponsoring Organization is a HIPAA covered entity – a health plan, health care clearinghouse, or qualifying health care provider – we may collect, process, and disclose your Protected Health Information (“PHI”) as a Business Associate.  Under HIPAA, a Business Associate is any person or entity that performs functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involves access to PHI.  When acting as Business Associate, we may be performing a number of functions in support of the covered entity’s Treatment, Payment, or Health Care Operations, including but not limited to: (i) providing the HIW services to you; (ii) collecting, maintaining, transmitting, or processing your PHI; (iii) analyzing your PHI, either individually or as part of an aggregated data set; (iv) combining your PHI with other data collected or obtained by the covered entity; (v) de-identifying your PHI; and/or (vi) preparing a limited data set based on your PHI. As a Business Associate, we may only use your PHI for the purposes for which we were engaged by your Sponsoring Organization, must safeguard your PHI from misuse, and must assist your Sponsoring Organization to comply with its duties under HIPAA.  If you have questions about your Sponsoring Organization’s use of your PHI and your rights under HIPAA, we encourage you to consult that organization’s Notice of Privacy Practices.
Develop New Service Offerings.
We use personal information to analyze the needs and health risks of our members with the goal of developing new assessments and tools.  We are continually refining and improving the services to keep members challenged and engaged.
Develop New Business Opportunities.
We use data gathered through our advertising and marketing programs to build customer profiles of businesses that may be interested in our software.  We use that information to refine our existing products and identify opportunities for new lines of business.
Customer Support.
We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, restore service to customers, and provide customer support, including helping us to identify, investigate, and resolve potential security incidents.  This may include the use of automated systems to detect security and safety issues.
Management and Administration.
We use personal information for the management and administration of our agreements with corporate, institutional, and organization customers, including as necessary to respond to customer inquiries, track consumer and patient requests, aggregate and de-identify data, and prepare limited data sets, as authorized by the applicable contract.

Promotional Communications.
We use the data we collect through our Website to deliver promotional communications.  Visitors to our Website can provide their contact information and express a preference concerning the sales and promotional materials they would like to receive.  You can sign up for email updates, request a call from a Sales representative, and sign up for updates concerning the products or topics that interest you.  For information about managing your contact data, email preferences, and promotional communications, see the “How to Opt-Out of Promotional Communications” section of this policy.
Advertising.
We use cookies, trackers, and similar technology to identify the business affiliation of visitors to our Website and build customer profiles of their companies.  Our advertising partners use cookies and tags installed on our Website to recognize and serve our visitors with advertising for our products and services.  These tags, such as Microsoft’s Universal Event Tracker (UET), allow our advertising partners to identify you even after you have left our Website.  Our partners may pair data about your activity on our site, or your interaction with our advertisements, with information they already have about you.  We participate in Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Terminus advertising.  You can find more information about these programs and each advertiser’s use of your data by visiting their website and reviewing their privacy policy.  If you wish to discontinue an advertiser’s use of your data entirely, you will need to take advantage of that company’s opt-out procedures, which you can find posted on their website or in the applicable privacy policy.  Our opt-out mechanism, described in further detail below, extends only to the information that we collect.
Compliance and Protection.
We may disclose your personal information if we are legally required to do so. We may also use and disclose personal information to establish or exercise our legal rights as permitted by law, to enforce the applicable Terms of Use, to assert and defend against legal claims as permitted by law, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary and permitted to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal or fraudulent activities or potential threats to the physical safety or well-being of any person.
We May Use Your Personal Information to Develop a Profile of Your Wellness and Lifestyle Risk Factors
“Profiling” means any form of automated processing of personal data to evaluate, analyze, or predict personal aspects concerning an identified or identifiable individual’s economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements.
HIW may build a profile of your overall wellness and lifestyle based on your survey responses, assessment results, and any health or personal information you have provided to us in person or through the HIW App. We will use your profile data, and any inferences we may draw therefrom, for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
We do not use this information for an automated decision that results in the provision or denial of financial or lending services, housing, insurance, education enrollment or opportunity, criminal justice, employment opportunities, health-care services, or access to essential goods or services.
Because we do not process your personal data for a decision that results in the provision or denial of essential goods or services, we have not provided you the opportunity to opt-out.
If you are receiving the services though a Sponsoring Organization, we may augment your profile with additional information provided by that organization. In such cases, our processing of your personal information will be governed by the terms of our contract with your Sponsoring Organization. If you submit an inquiry or request that concerns personal information that was not collected by us, we will either respond to you in accordance with our customer’s instructions or inform you that your request has been sent to your Sponsoring Organization and cannot be acted upon by us. You can learn more about your Sponsoring Organization’s use of your personal data in their Privacy Policy, typically found on the homepage of the organization’s public website.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
We are committed to protecting the security of your personal data and utilize a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  For example, we store your personal information on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that our systems, or that any such transmissions or information, will be totally secure. Unencrypted internet communications are not secure, and no security measures are impenetrable. Please notify us immediately of any breach of security, or of this Privacy Policy, of which you become aware.
We Share Your Personal Information with Our Technology Service Providers

We Share Your Personal Information with Your Sponsoring Organization
We typically sell our services in one of two ways: (1) directly to you, the consumer, or (2) to a sponsoring corporation, institution, school, or other organization that will wishes to offer the services to you, usually as part of a health and wellness initiative, benefits plan, or other form of incentive program (each, a
“Sponsoring Organization”

We Share Personal Information with Our Advertising Partners for Targeted Advertising
Our Website uses cookies, tags, and similar technologies to share personal information about our visitors with our advertising partners for advertising and marketing purposes, including individual end user tracking and cross-context behavioral advertising.  These services allow us to identify businesses that have visited our Website before and serve their representatives with ads for our products and services.  By placing these cookies and tags on your device when you visit our Website, or click on one of our advertisements, we are able to collect personal information about your device, such as your IP address, operating system, and browser, as well as your internet activity, including what you do after you have visited our Website or interacted with one of our advertisements.  This information is automatically shared with the advertiser responsible for the cookie or tag, who then uses that information to serve you with ads on our behalf.  You may opt-out of our sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising and marketing purposes by following the opt-out procedures described below, in the “How to Opt-Out of Our Sharing of Your Personal Information” section of this policy.  If you wish to exercise your opt-out rights with respect to interest-based advertising in general, we have also included information on some of the industry-wide resources available to you.
Browser-Based Controls
When you use a browser, you may be able to control your personal data using certain features.  For example:
Cookie Controls.
You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using your browser-based cookie controls.  Should you choose to decline or block cookies by adjusting your browser settings, you may disrupt the operation of cookies that are essential to our Site.  As a result, some or all of our Site may be functional or accessible to you.
Tracking Protections.
You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge.  This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.  This feature is not available on all browsers, and is often confused with a “Do Not Track” request.
Browser Controls for “Do Not Track.”
Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features that can send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.  Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the “Do Not Track” signal, not all services respond to this browser signal.  Until the industry reaches a common understanding of how to treat these signals, you should use the “Do Not Track” feature in conjunction with another form of opt-out.  Many websites still collect and use your browsing data to improve security, provide content, services, ads and recommendations on their websites, and generate reporting statistics.
If we receive or detect an opt-out preference signal from your browser or device, we shall treat the preference signal as a valid request to opt-out of our sharing of your personal information.   If the opt-out signal conflicts with your prior consent for such sharing, we may notify you of the conflict and provide you with an opportunity to consent to the sharing of your personal information.

How to Opt-Out of Receiving Interest-Based Ads
Several of our advertising partners use online interest-based advertising to identify potential customers and show them advertisements that may be of interest.   They do this by pairing information about your activity on our Site, which they collect using cookies and tags from our Site, with information they have about you from other sources.   Our advertising partners use a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, as well as a variety of advertising technologies, like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers.  When you see one of our ads, that ad may be have been selected based on data processed by our advertiser, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use their products, your search queries, or the content you view.  The ads you see may also be based on other information the advertiser has learned about you over time, using demographic data, location data, search queries, interest and favorites, usage data from their products and sites, and the information they have collected about you from the sites and apps of their advertisers and partners, of which we are one.  Our advertising partners – Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, and Terminus – all offer interest-based advertising.
To learn more about interest-based ads or to opt-out of receiving third-party interest based ads, please visit one of the industry’s self-regulatory programs, such as the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAI).  Both programs offer opt-out resources to consumers, which you can access at
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
or
https://youradchoices.com/control
.   Please note that if you opt of interest-based advertising, you will still see advertisements – they will just not be tailored to your interests.   Also note that the opt-out preference is stored in a cookie, so if you delete your browser cookies, you may need to opt-out again in the future.
How to Opt-Out of Promotional Communications
You may request a call from our Sales team by providing your name, company, and contact information through our Site. If you elect us to provide us this information, it will be used for advertising and marketing purposes, including promotional communications and targeted advertising. If you would like us to stop using your contact information, you may send a request to
ops@healthyiswellness.com
. You can also limit the types of communications you receive by submitting your communication preferences at
ops@healthyiswellness.com
.
We Do Not Sell Your Personal Data
We do not sell your personal data to any third party.  Should that change, we will: (1) update this Consumer Privacy Policy; (2) ask your consent to the sale of your personal data; and (3) provide you with an opportunity to opt-out at any time via the HIW Website.
Because we do not sell your personal data, we have not provided you the opportunity to opt-out.
Collection of Data from Children
We have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.  Our products and services are not intended for use by minors and we do not knowingly collect information about or target advertising to anyone under the age of 16.
We Have Not Disclosed Personal Information to a Third Party in the Past 12 Months
We consider a “third party” to mean anyone other than: (1) a corporate, institutional, or organizational payer who has entered into a written agreement to provide the services to you as an incentive, wellness initiative, or other benefit; (2) a service provider; or (3) a contractor. We do not disclose personal information to third parties unless required to do so to comply with federal, state, or local law; comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, or local authorities; cooperate with law enforcement agencies; or exercise or defend a legal claim.
Linked Sites
For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on our Website that link to external Web sites which we do not control. We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, the privacy practices of other companies. You should not assume that our Privacy Policy applies to any external sites, or that the policies applicable to those sites are similar to ours. You will need to review each site’s privacy policy to understand how your personal information will be collected and used by the owner of the site.
Account Deletion Requests
You may request that we delete your user account on our Mobile App and the user data associated therewith by contacting us at
ops@healthyiswellness.com
.   Please identify the subject of your email as “Account Deletion Request” in the subject line.
If you no longer wish to receive the HIW’s coaching services, we will close your Mobile App account.
Closing your account may not result in the deletion of all associated data.
In many cases, HIW acts as a service provider to an organization that has a pre-existing customer, patient, or employment relationship with you.  We may also be acting as a technology services provider to an independent HIW licensed location.  If we have collected your information on behalf of your sponsoring organization or a licensed location, we will coordinate the resolution of your request with that entity.  HIW will either act on behalf of that business in accordance with the business’ instructions for responding to an account deletion request or inform you that we cannot delete your data because we are acting as a service provider.
Please bear in mind that the HIW Mobile App is intended to facilitate an in-person coaching session that involves the collection of personal health data through assessments, tests, and surveys.  Because that information is not collected through the HIW Mobile App, data deletion requires more than simply closing your account and deleting your user activity and registration information.  For that reason, we cannot provide an immediate or automated data deletion feature.
We will not delete deidentified user data and reserve the right to retain certain user and network activity data for security, fraud prevention, and customer support.
Individual Rights under HIPAA
HIW is not itself a covered entity subject to HIPAA.  However, we regularly do business with covered entities that wish to provide the HIW services to their patients or customers.
If we have collected your personal information as a Business Associate to a covered entity, that information constitutes Protected Health Information subject to HIPAA and the terms of our Business Associate Agreement.
HIPAA grants individuals certain rights with respect to their PHI, including access to their medical records and other information, the right to request changes or amendments to their PHI, the right to request an account of disclosures, and the right to request certain restrictions on how your PHI is used or shared.  If we receive a request from you concerning our collection and processing of your PHI, we will respond to that request as authorized by the covered entity and in accordance with their instructions.
Consumer Rights – California, Virginia, Connecticut and Colorado
Certain states have enacted consumer data privacy laws affording the residents of their states specific rights with respect to the collection, use, and handling of their personal information.  If we are not providing the services on behalf of a covered entity (such that HIPAA would apply), you may be entitled to exercise certain rights under state law.  In making this notification, we do not concede the jurisdiction of any of these state laws, each of which impose certain threshold requirements and specifically exempt certain types of data.  If we receive a request to exercise consumer rights under any state privacy framework, we will analyze that request and our obligations on a case by case basis.  Nonetheless, you are hereby notified that you may be entitled to exercise any or all of the following rights under the laws of your state:
Rights of California Residents
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) confers certain rights on California residents with respect to the processing of their personal information.  These rights include:
The right to know what personal information we have collected about you;
The right to delete personal information that we have collected about you, subject to certain exceptions;
The right to correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you;
The right to opt-out of our sharing of your personal information, which you may exercise
here
; and
The right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of these rights, including an employee or applicant’s right not to be retaliated against. We will not discriminate against you because you exercised your rights under the CCPA.  Examples of retaliation include denying you goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or suggesting that you will receive a different price or level of service based on your exercise of rights.
Under California law, the term “sharing” refers to the act of sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising.  In other words, your opt-out will apply to our sharing of your personal information for behavioral advertising purposes through the cookies and tracking technologies on our Website, and not to our sharing of your information with our service providers and your Sponsoring Organization (if applicable).
You may exercise your rights yourself or through an authorized agent, using the procedures outlined below.  No later than ten (10) business days upon receiving a request to delete, request to correct, or request to know, we will confirm receipt of your request and provide information about how we will process it.  If we have conducted business in California such that the CCPA applies to us, we will respond to you with a decision in 45 days, or, in unusual cases, an explanation of the need for an additional 45 days.  If we deny your request in whole or in part, we will explain the basis of the denial to you, unless prohibited from doing so by law.
We may deny your request on the basis that we do not conduct business in California in a manner or to an extent that would subject us to the jurisdiction of California law.
Rights of Virginia Residents
The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) authorizes certain consumer rights for residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia with respect to the processing of their personal data.  We will comply with a consumer request to exercise any of the following rights:
To confirm whether or not we are processing your personal data and to access such personal data;
To correct inaccuracies in your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing;
To delete the personal data provided by or obtained about you;
To obtain a copy of your personal data that you previously provided to us in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another controller without hindrances, where the processing is carried out by automated means; and
To opt-out of the processing of personal data for the purposes of (i) targeted advertising, (ii) the sale of personal data, or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you. You may exercise your right to opt-out of targeted advertising
here
.
We will respond to you without undue delay, but in all cases within 45 days of receipt of a request submitted pursuant to this policy.  The response period may be extended once by 45 additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of your requests.  In that event, we will inform you of the extension, together with the reason for it.
If we decline to take action regarding your request, we will inform you without undue delay, but in all cases and at the latest within 45 days of receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal the decision.
We may decline your request on the basis that we do not conduct business in Virginia in a manner or to an extent that would subject us to the jurisdiction of Virginia law.
You may address appeals to our Legal Department at
ops@healthyiswellness.com

Changes in Control
As Healthy Is Wellness, LLC, grows and develops its business, it is possible that its corporate structure or organization might change or that it might merge or otherwise combine with, or that it or portions of its business might be acquired by, another company. If we experiences a Change in Control (as defined below), then we may amend our privacy and information usage practices described in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, you should expect that, as permitted by law, your personal information will be one of the assets that will be transferred to the legal entity that succeeds our operation and ownership of the System. The privacy practices of the succeeding legal entity will then govern the personal information so transferred. However, if applicable law prohibits the succeeding legal entity’s privacy policy from governing your personal information, then this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Change In Control” means any of the following events:  (i) a reorganization, merger, consolidation, acquisition or other restructuring involving all or substantially all of our voting securities and/or assets, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) appointment of a receiver for our business or assets; or (iv) our sale or liquidation, voluntarily or otherwise.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center
.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account
. Stripe offers a service called "Link," which allows you to create an account and store information for future interactions with Stripe’s Services and Business Users. You may save a number of different kinds of Personal Data using Link. For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.
Learn More
.
You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe
. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.

More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Users
Services
. We use and share your Personal Data to provide the End User Services to you, which includes support, personalization (such as language preferences and setting choices), and communication about our End User Services (such as communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, Stripe may use cookies and similar technologies or the data you provide to our Business Users (such as when you input your email address on a Business User’s website) to recognize you and help you use Link when visiting our Business User’s website. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies in Stripe’s
Cookie Policy

Our Business Users.
When you use Link to make payments with our Business Users, we share your Personal Data, including name, contact information, payment method details, and Transaction Data with those Business Users.
Learn More
. You can also direct Stripe to share your saved bank account information and identity documents with Business Users you do business with. Once we share your Personal Data with Business Users, we may process that Personal Data as a Data Processor for those Business Users, as detailed in Section 1.2 of this Policy.  You should consult the privacy policies of the Business Users’ you do business with for information on how they use the information shared with them.
Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention
. We use your Personal Data collected across our Services to detect fraud and prevent financial losses for you, us, and our Business Users and Financial Partners, including detecting unauthorized purchases. We may provide Business Users and Financial Partners, including those that use our fraud prevention-related Business Services (such as Stripe Radar), with Personal Data about you (including your attempted transactions) so that they can assess the fraud or loss risk associated with the transaction. Learn more about how we may use technology to assess the fraud risk associated with an attempted transaction and what information we share with Business Users and Financial Partners

and

.
Advertising
. Where permitted by applicable law, we may use your Personal Data, including Transaction Data, to assess your eligibility for, and offer you, other End User Services or promote existing End User Services, including through co-marketing with partners such as Stripe Business Users.
Learn more
. Subject to applicable law, including any consent requirements, we use and share End User Personal Data with third party partners to allow us to advertise our End User Services to you, including through interest-based advertising, and to track the efficacy of such ads. We do not transfer your Personal Data to third parties in exchange for payment, but we may provide your data to third-party partners, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our Services to you.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center

legal bases
we rely on for processing your Personal Data.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Customers
Transaction Data
. If you're an End Customer making payments to, receiving refunds or payments from, initiating a purchase or donation, or otherwise transacting with our Business User, whether in-person or online, we receive your Transaction Data. We may also receive your transaction history with the Business User.

To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.
