At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet
That’s why we build Firefox, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data we process, how we process it, and for what purposes. Then, we explain how you can exercise choices about how we process your information.
How is your data used?
To provide you with the Firefox browser
Mozilla collects
certain data
, like technical and settings data, to provide the core functionality of the Firefox browser and associated services, distinguish your device from others, remember and respect your settings, and provide you with default features such as
New Tab
,
PDF editing
,
password manager
and
Total Cookie Protection
. You can further customize your Firefox experience by adjusting your
controls, buttons, and toolbars
and adding
features with add-ons
.
Some Firefox features, like automated
translation
for web pages and
“alt-text” suggestions when you upload images in your PDFs
, are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) based on small language models downloaded to your device. These operate locally — web page content, PDFs, images and tab URLs stay on your device and are not sent to Mozilla’s servers or used for training purposes without your explicit consent. Note that other Firefox features may integrate third-party AI models, as further detailed in this Notice.

You can read more detailed information about the information we collect for
Desktop
,
Android
or
iOS
. You can update your data collection settings for
Desktop
and
Mobile
at any time.
To adapt Firefox to your needs
Firefox processes a variety of personal data in a way that does not leave your device, such as browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies. This means the data stays on your device and is not sent to Mozilla’s servers unless it says otherwise in this Notice. If you choose to allow it, your precise location may also be processed for location-related functionality for websites like Google Maps; this data is only accessed from your device by the website(s) you choose to enable it for — it is not sent to Mozilla's servers.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
Data processed on your device remains in your control. You can
manage your browsing data
and your
local storage settings
, or update your
location permissions
at any time.
To provide and improve search functionality
When you perform a search in Firefox, your search query, device data and location data will be processed by your default search engine (according to their
applicable Privacy Notice
) to provide your search results and search suggestions.
Firefox also shows its own
search suggestions
based on information stored on your local device (including recent search terms, open tabs, and previously visited URLs). These suggestions may include sponsored suggestions from Mozilla’s partners, relevant content from common internet resources (such as Wikipedia), or relevant URLs that are popular in your country. Mozilla processes certain technical and interaction data, such as how many searches you perform, how many sponsored suggestions you see and whether you interact with them. Mozilla's partners receive de-identified information about interactions with the suggestions they've served. You can enable or disable
Search suggestions
at any time.
Depending on your location, Mozilla derives the high level category (e.g., travel, shopping) of your search from keywords in that query, in order to understand the types and number of searches being made. We utilize privacy preserving technologies such that Mozilla only learns that someone, somewhere, performed a search relating to a particular category, without knowing who.
Learn more
about how we categorize searches, including how to opt out.
Mozilla may also receive location-related keywords from your search (such as when you search for “Boston”) and share this with our partners to provide recommended and sponsored content. Where this occurs, Mozilla cannot associate the keyword search with an individual user once the search suggestion has been served and partners are never able to associate search suggestions with an individual user. You can remove this functionality at any time by turning off Sponsored Suggestions — more information on how to do this is available in the relevant
Firefox Support
page.
You may be able to opt into an enhanced search experience, which will result in Mozilla processing additional personal data, including your technical data, location and search data. Some of that information may be shared with our partners on a de-identified and/or aggregated basis. See our “Data and Firefox Suggest”
blog post
for more details.

You can update your
Search settings
and
Search suggestion features
, at any time, and learn more about how we
categorize searches
.
To serve relevant content and advertising on Firefox New Tab
We use technical data, language preference, and location to serve content and advertising on the Firefox New Tab page in the correct format (i.e. for mobile vs desktop), language, and relevant location. Mozilla collects technical and interaction data, such as the position, size, views and clicks on New Tab content or ads, to understand how people are interacting with our content and to personalize future content, including sponsored content. This data may be shared with our advertising partners on a de-identified or aggregated basis.
In some instances, when ads are enabled on New Tab, additional browsing data may also be processed locally on your device to measure the effectiveness of those ads; such data will only be shared with Mozilla and/or our advertising partners via our privacy-preserving technologies on an aggregated and/or de-identified basis.
When a user visits a third-party website by clicking an advertisement or link in Firefox, that site may use cookies and other web APIs available to any website to collect data subject to that website’s privacy and/or cookie notices.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can read more information about
how to manage your New Tab page
including your
data settings
. You can opt out of having your data processed for personalization or advertising purposes by turning off “technical and interaction data” on
Desktop
and
Mobile
at any time.
To provide Mozilla accounts
If you sign up for a Mozilla account, we process additional information alongside the data set out in this Notice, such as account details, contact information and sync data, in accordance with the
Mozilla Accounts Privacy Notice
.
To provide AI Chatbots
You have the option to use a third-party AI chatbot of your choice to help you with things like summarizing what you’re reading, writing and brainstorming ideas, subject to that provider’s
terms of use and privacy notice
.
If you choose to enable a chatbot in the sidebar and/or through a shortcut, Mozilla does not have access to your conversations or the underlying content you input into the selected chatbot. We do collect technical and interaction data on how this feature is used to help improve Firefox, such as how often each third-party chatbot provider is chosen, how often suggested prompts are used, and the length of selected text.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can read more about how to
manage
or
remove
AI chatbots in Firefox.
To provide Review Checker, including serving sponsored content
Review Checker is a Firefox feature that helps you determine whether reviews are reliable when you shop online with sites like Amazon.com, BestBuy.com and Walmart.com. If you opt in to using Review Checker, Mozilla will process information about the website and the product identifier of the products you view using our privacy preserving technology called
OHTTP
. OHTTP combines encryption and a third party intermediary server, helping prevent Mozilla from linking you or your device to the products you have viewed. We also collect technical and interaction data on how this feature is used to help improve Firefox.
By opting in to using Review Checker you also agree to be shown product recommendations and sponsored content. If you do not want to receive product recommendations and sponsored content, you can opt out of this feature under Review Checker settings at any time.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can read more information about
How to use Firefox Review Checker
and how we implement privacy preserving tech such as
OHTTP
.
To provide and enable add-ons (addons.mozilla.org)
You can install add-ons from addons.mozilla.org (“AMO”) or from the Firefox Add-ons Manager, which is accessible from the Firefox menu button in the toolbar. We process your search queries in the Add-ons Manager to be able to provide you with suggested add-ons. If you choose to install any add-ons, Firefox will process technical, location and settings data, and periodically connect with Mozilla’s servers to install and apply the correct updates to your add-ons. We also collect technical and interaction data on usage of add-ons, to help improve Firefox.
When you visit the
AMO website
, Mozilla collects technical and interaction data about your usage of the site in accordance with our
Mozilla Websites, Communications and Cookies
notice.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
Learn
how to remove or enable add-ons
. You can also review the
Privacy Notice

add-ons website
.
To maintain and improve features, performance and stability
Mozilla runs
studies
within Firefox and makes certain
experimental features
available through Firefox Labs to test different features and ideas before they’re made available to all Firefox users or become part of the core Firefox offering — this allows us to make more informed decisions about what our users want and need. This research uses technical, system performance, location, settings and interaction data.
We also need to process data to keep Firefox operational, improve features and performance, and identify, troubleshoot and diagnose issues. For this we use technical, location and settings data, as well as interaction and system performance data (such as number of tabs open, memory usage or the outcome of automated processes like updates). In the rare situations where the information needed also includes limited browsing data (e.g., Top Level Domain annotations for page-load performance monitoring), it will be transmitted using OHTTP; this helps prevent Mozilla from linking you or your device to the data collected for this purpose.
On Desktop and Android, if Firefox encounters an unexpected issue, the
Mozilla Crash Reporter
will also ask if you wish to send us additional information, which may include sites that were open at the time of the crash and other browsing data. On Desktop and Android if you opt in to sending us crash reports automatically, we collect this information without prompting you each time; on iOS, crash reports contain less information and are sent automatically to us by default. You can change your settings at any time.
More information, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can
learn more
about the studies you’re enrolled in and opt out of all (or a specific) studies at any time, and opt into experimental features through
Firefox Labs
. You can also
learn more
about the technical and interaction data we process, including how to turn it off.
To improve security
Because maintaining the latest version of Firefox helps keep you safe against vulnerabilities, desktop versions of Firefox regularly connect to Mozilla’s servers (or another service that you used to install Firefox) to check for software updates; updates for Android and iOS versions of Firefox are managed by Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store, respectively.
We also process technical data and settings data to protect against malicious add-ons.
In addition to these standard processes, we use
Google’s Safe Browsing Service
to protect you from malicious downloads and phishing attacks, and validate web page and technical data with
Certificate Authorities
. As part of our work to improve privacy and security for all internet users, we collect technical data via
OHTTP
, to better understand, prevent and defend against fingerprinting.
For
some Firefox users
, Firefox routes DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla’s
strict privacy standards for resolvers
. This provides added protection from privacy leaks to local networks and also from certain DNS security attacks. System logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution.

To understand usage of Firefox
We process
data
to better understand how you engage with our services, such as how much you use Firefox, your language preference, how often you use our search tools or interact with search suggestions, how fast pages load for you and how many ads or
CAPTCHAs
you see. This allows us to measure how people access and use our services, which helps improve our business and the functionality of Firefox.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can update your data collection settings for
Desktop
and
Mobile
at any time (note that deselecting “Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla” will not impact the
Daily Usage Ping
). This Daily Usage Ping solely provides us with de-identified information that a user is using Firefox and is not tied to any other data about you and can be opted out in the settings.
To market our services
When you allow us to do so, Firefox sends Mozilla data about the website domain or specific advertising campaign (if any) that referred you to our download page to help us understand and improve our marketing efforts. Firefox also shares information with our marketing partners to measure and improve these campaigns; what information is specifically shared varies (depending on how you discovered Firefox and your operating system) but generally includes how you were referred to our download page and whether you actively use Firefox. Where Firefox is pre-installed on your device, technical and interaction data (your device type and whether Firefox is used) will be sent to our marketing partners, and shared with Mozilla.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
Learn more about what
Campaign Measurement data
is collected and shared, and how to opt out. Note: Firefox does not share information like your browsing history, search queries, or saved passwords with marketing technology partners. Mozilla only collects the data necessary to measure and improve our marketing campaigns.
To pseudonymize, de-identify, aggregate or anonymize data
As part of the activities outlined above, such as understanding usage of Firefox and measuring our marketing, we may create pseudonymous, de-identified, aggregated or anonymized data. We use technology that is appropriate to the circumstances, including identifier removal, OHTTP, or DAP — these help prevent data from being linked to you. In some cases, we may share or publish aggregated and anonymized data to facilitate research or as part of the lawful business purposes outlined above (such as sharing aggregated insights with advertising partners).
To communicate with you
Depending on your settings (and whether or not you have a Mozilla account), we may communicate with you via in-product messaging, send you communications (including marketing-related communications), or ask you to participate in research / surveys, or respond to customer support communications. You may also reach out to us directly, such as to
report a broken site within Firefox
. When you send us personal data via these methods, we will use the information only for the purpose you provided it. We also process interaction data related to these communications to better understand who has received our service-related announcements (such as new features, updates or security alerts).
To comply with applicable laws, and identify and prevent harmful, unauthorized or illegal activity
We may also be required to process your personal data to comply with applicable laws and protection purposes, such as:
Responding to
lawful requests
and complying with
legal processes
, such as responding to subpoenas, investigations, or requests from government authorities. Mozilla requires a valid Legal Process to compel the disclosure of Specific User data to a government.
Responding to requests to exercise privacy rights, such as your right to access or delete your personal data.
Identifying, investigating and addressing potential fraudulent activities, or other harmful activities such as illegal activities, cyberattacks or intellectual property infringement (including filing or defending legal claims).
Performing internal compliance and security activities, such as audits and enterprise security management.
How is your data shared?
To provide our services as described above, we may disclose personal data to:
Partners, service providers, suppliers and contractors
To perform the purposes listed above, we work with partners, service providers, suppliers and contractors. We have contractual protections in place, so that the entities receiving personal data are contractually obligated to handle the data in accordance with Mozilla’s instructions.
Authorities
Mozilla requires a valid
Legal Process
to compel the disclosure of specific user data to a government. In those instances we may need to disclose the personal data set out in this Notice to law enforcement, government authorities, or similar entities to comply with applicable laws, and to identify and prevent harmful, unauthorized or illegal activity.
Researchers
When we are fulfilling our
mission
of being open. We sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when we do, we will do so in a de-identified or aggregated
format
.
Mozilla controlled entities and successors
As a global company, we share data across Mozilla-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We may also need to disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or similar transaction.
How long is your data kept?
We only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice. In general, we do not retain personal data for more than 25 months, but actual retention periods may vary depending on the type of data and the purpose(s) for which it was collected (for example, we retain your “first seen” date for the period of your use of Firefox, so we know how long you’ve been a Firefox user). Specific retention periods may also depend on the sensitivity of the data, the context of its collection, your settings and preferences, and our legal or contractual obligations to retain or delete your data, such as for fraud prevention, regulatory compliance, or service continuity. Once the retention period expires we securely delete your data, unless otherwise required by law.
Our services also use encrypted backup storage as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters; data in these environments is put beyond use and only processed for business continuity purposes. We may also retain data for extended periods of time on a de-identified or aggregated basis.
Your rights and choices
Your rights:
As a Firefox user, you have the right to:
Be informed about what data we process about you, why and who it’s shared with (that’s this Notice!)
Request a copy of the data we have about you
Request portability of your data
Request correction of any data we hold about you that is inaccurate or incomplete
Have personal data we hold about you deleted (in certain circumstances)
In some cases, restrict or object to how we use your personal data
Complain to your relevant data protection authority if you have concerns about how we’re handling your personal data. We’d prefer it if you contact us first (via
dpo@mozilla.com
), but you can also reach out to your relevant
EU data protection authority
, or search for (and contact) your local data protection authority
To make any of the above requests regarding your personal data, please contact us (Mozilla Corporation) through our
Data Subject Access Request Portal
; we will never discriminate against anyone for exercising their privacy rights. If you have any other questions regarding personal data or our privacy practices, please contact us at
compliance@mozilla.com
.
If you’re in the UK or EEA, you can also contact our Data Protection Officer at
dpo@mozilla.com
, or by mail at:
Bird & Bird DPO Services SRL
Avenue Louise 235 b 1
1050 Brussels
Belgium
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws, and we may need to ask you for additional information to confirm your identity before we can proceed with your request.
Please note that, when you request deletion of your Firefox data, it will be deleted within 30 days of the request (with the exception of Interaction Data, which has a standard retention period of 90 days and is automatically deleted at the end of this period).
Your choices:
You can update your data collection settings for
Desktop
and
Mobile
at any time.
Firefox also provides
Global Privacy Control
(GPC), which you can enable to automatically notify websites not to sell or share information about your browsing session on that website. GPC operates as a “Do Not Sell” mechanism in some US states such as California, Colorado and Connecticut. It may also be used to indicate an opt-out of targeted advertising or general request to limit the sale or sharing of your personal data in those jurisdictions, as well as in jurisdictions such as the EU, UK, Nevada, Utah and Virginia.
What happens with international data transfers?
Mozilla (and our servers) are based in the United States. Because we are a global company, in order to provide the services outlined in this Privacy Notice, the information we collect may be accessed from locations where our people are located and data may also be transferred to other jurisdictions as a result of sharing data with our partners. Where appropriate, we ensure we have appropriate mechanisms in place (such as
standard contractual clauses
approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities) to protect your personal data. You can contact
dpo@mozilla.com
for information on the safeguards implemented for international transfers, or for copies of the relevant standard contractual clauses.
Applicability (Firefox version) and changes
Applicability
This Privacy Notice is for the most recent general release version of Firefox distributed by Mozilla. If you obtain Firefox elsewhere, or are running an older version, your copy of Firefox may contain different privacy characteristics.
Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox (which are distributed through channels such as Nightly, Beta, Developer Edition and TestFlight) are development platforms frequently updated with experimental features and studies. In addition to the data collection described in this Privacy Notice, these versions by default may send certain types of web activity and crash data to Mozilla (and in some cases to our partners).
Changes
We may need to change this policy and our notices, in which case the updates will be posted online and we will update the effective date of this notice. If the changes are substantive, we will also announce the update more prominently through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements, such as blog posts and forums.

Firefox Privacy Notice
You’re in control
Privacy isn’t just a setting — it’s your right. The Firefox Privacy Notice is built on clarity, control and responsible defaults. We believe you should always be in charge of what happens with your data. You can count on us to clearly explain what Firefox does by default and adjust your settings so you can browse the way you want.
Read our Privacy Notice
Keeping you informed, every step of the way
We believe you should know how your data is used and why. Firefox is built with privacy in mind and transparency at every step.
Transparency first
We’re clear about what data we use and why. No surprises. The
Firefox Privacy Notice
details this for you.
How we use data
We use data to keep Firefox running smoothly, improve features and help sustain our business — all while respecting your privacy. Some optional features may require additional data to function, and we make it easy to manage your preferences.
Built-in control
Firefox gives you simple, yet powerful tools to manage your data the way you want. You can fine-tune your settings, separate work from your personal life or erase unwanted history with just a few clicks.
Always protected
Firefox protects you from known third-party trackers, social media trackers, cryptominers, cookies and fingerprinting technologies that try to follow you around the web.
Privacy that works for you
Firefox makes it easy to manage your data with built-in privacy and security features, plus settings that let you fine-tune your browsing experience.

Firefox privacy basics

At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet
That’s why we build Firefox, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data we process, how we process it, and for what purposes. Then, we explain how you can exercise choices about how we process your information.
How is your data used?
To provide you with the Firefox browser
Mozilla collects
certain data
, like technical and settings data, to provide the core functionality of the Firefox browser and associated services, distinguish your device from others, remember and respect your settings, and provide you with default features such as
New Tab
,
PDF editing
,
password manager
and
Total Cookie Protection
. You can further customize your Firefox experience by adjusting your
controls, buttons, and toolbars
and adding
features with add-ons
.
Some Firefox features, like automated
translation
for web pages and
“alt-text” suggestions when you upload images in your PDFs
, are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) based on small language models downloaded to your device. These operate locally — web page content, PDFs, images and tab URLs stay on your device and are not sent to Mozilla’s servers or used for training purposes without your explicit consent. Note that other Firefox features may integrate third-party AI models, as further detailed in this Notice.

You can read more detailed information about the information we collect for
Desktop
,
Android
or
iOS
. You can update your data collection settings for
Desktop
and
Mobile
at any time.
To adapt Firefox to your needs
Firefox processes a variety of personal data in a way that does not leave your device, such as browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies. This means the data stays on your device and is not sent to Mozilla’s servers unless it says otherwise in this Notice. If you choose to allow it, your precise location may also be processed for location-related functionality for websites like Google Maps; this data is only accessed from your device by the website(s) you choose to enable it for — it is not sent to Mozilla's servers.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
Data processed on your device remains in your control. You can
manage your browsing data
and your
local storage settings
, or update your
location permissions
at any time.
To provide and improve search functionality
When you perform a search in Firefox, your search query, device data and location data will be processed by your default search engine (according to their
applicable Privacy Notice
) to provide your search results and search suggestions.
Firefox also shows its own
search suggestions
based on information stored on your local device (including recent search terms, open tabs, and previously visited URLs). These suggestions may include sponsored suggestions from Mozilla’s partners, relevant content from common internet resources (such as Wikipedia), or relevant URLs that are popular in your country. Mozilla processes certain technical and interaction data, such as how many searches you perform, how many sponsored suggestions you see and whether you interact with them. Mozilla's partners receive de-identified information about interactions with the suggestions they've served. You can enable or disable
Search suggestions
at any time.
Depending on your location, Mozilla derives the high level category (e.g., travel, shopping) of your search from keywords in that query, in order to understand the types and number of searches being made. We utilize privacy preserving technologies such that Mozilla only learns that someone, somewhere, performed a search relating to a particular category, without knowing who.
Learn more
about how we categorize searches, including how to opt out.
Mozilla may also receive location-related keywords from your search (such as when you search for “Boston”) and share this with our partners to provide recommended and sponsored content. Where this occurs, Mozilla cannot associate the keyword search with an individual user once the search suggestion has been served and partners are never able to associate search suggestions with an individual user. You can remove this functionality at any time by turning off Sponsored Suggestions — more information on how to do this is available in the relevant
Firefox Support
page.
You may be able to opt into an enhanced search experience, which will result in Mozilla processing additional personal data, including your technical data, location and search data. Some of that information may be shared with our partners on a de-identified and/or aggregated basis. See our “Data and Firefox Suggest”
blog post
for more details.

You can update your
Search settings
and
Search suggestion features
, at any time, and learn more about how we
categorize searches
.
To serve relevant content and advertising on Firefox New Tab
We use technical data, language preference, and location to serve content and advertising on the Firefox New Tab page in the correct format (i.e. for mobile vs desktop), language, and relevant location. Mozilla collects technical and interaction data, such as the position, size, views and clicks on New Tab content or ads, to understand how people are interacting with our content and to personalize future content, including sponsored content. This data may be shared with our advertising partners on a de-identified or aggregated basis.
In some instances, when ads are enabled on New Tab, additional browsing data may also be processed locally on your device to measure the effectiveness of those ads; such data will only be shared with Mozilla and/or our advertising partners via our privacy-preserving technologies on an aggregated and/or de-identified basis.
When a user visits a third-party website by clicking an advertisement or link in Firefox, that site may use cookies and other web APIs available to any website to collect data subject to that website’s privacy and/or cookie notices.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can read more information about
how to manage your New Tab page
including your
data settings
. You can opt out of having your data processed for personalization or advertising purposes by turning off “technical and interaction data” on
Desktop
and
Mobile
at any time.
To provide Mozilla accounts
If you sign up for a Mozilla account, we process additional information alongside the data set out in this Notice, such as account details, contact information and sync data, in accordance with the
Mozilla Accounts Privacy Notice
.
To provide AI Chatbots
You have the option to use a third-party AI chatbot of your choice to help you with things like summarizing what you’re reading, writing and brainstorming ideas, subject to that provider’s
terms of use and privacy notice
.
If you choose to enable a chatbot in the sidebar and/or through a shortcut, Mozilla does not have access to your conversations or the underlying content you input into the selected chatbot. We do collect technical and interaction data on how this feature is used to help improve Firefox, such as how often each third-party chatbot provider is chosen, how often suggested prompts are used, and the length of selected text.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can read more about how to
manage
or
remove
AI chatbots in Firefox.
To provide Review Checker, including serving sponsored content
Review Checker is a Firefox feature that helps you determine whether reviews are reliable when you shop online with sites like Amazon.com, BestBuy.com and Walmart.com. If you opt in to using Review Checker, Mozilla will process information about the website and the product identifier of the products you view using our privacy preserving technology called
OHTTP
. OHTTP combines encryption and a third party intermediary server, helping prevent Mozilla from linking you or your device to the products you have viewed. We also collect technical and interaction data on how this feature is used to help improve Firefox.
By opting in to using Review Checker you also agree to be shown product recommendations and sponsored content. If you do not want to receive product recommendations and sponsored content, you can opt out of this feature under Review Checker settings at any time.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can read more information about
How to use Firefox Review Checker
and how we implement privacy preserving tech such as
OHTTP
.
To provide and enable add-ons (addons.mozilla.org)
You can install add-ons from addons.mozilla.org (“AMO”) or from the Firefox Add-ons Manager, which is accessible from the Firefox menu button in the toolbar. We process your search queries in the Add-ons Manager to be able to provide you with suggested add-ons. If you choose to install any add-ons, Firefox will process technical, location and settings data, and periodically connect with Mozilla’s servers to install and apply the correct updates to your add-ons. We also collect technical and interaction data on usage of add-ons, to help improve Firefox.
When you visit the
AMO website
, Mozilla collects technical and interaction data about your usage of the site in accordance with our
Mozilla Websites, Communications and Cookies
notice.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
Learn
how to remove or enable add-ons
. You can also review the
Privacy Notice

add-ons website
.
To maintain and improve features, performance and stability
Mozilla runs
studies
within Firefox and makes certain
experimental features
available through Firefox Labs to test different features and ideas before they’re made available to all Firefox users or become part of the core Firefox offering — this allows us to make more informed decisions about what our users want and need. This research uses technical, system performance, location, settings and interaction data.
We also need to process data to keep Firefox operational, improve features and performance, and identify, troubleshoot and diagnose issues. For this we use technical, location and settings data, as well as interaction and system performance data (such as number of tabs open, memory usage or the outcome of automated processes like updates). In the rare situations where the information needed also includes limited browsing data (e.g., Top Level Domain annotations for page-load performance monitoring), it will be transmitted using OHTTP; this helps prevent Mozilla from linking you or your device to the data collected for this purpose.
On Desktop and Android, if Firefox encounters an unexpected issue, the
Mozilla Crash Reporter
will also ask if you wish to send us additional information, which may include sites that were open at the time of the crash and other browsing data. On Desktop and Android if you opt in to sending us crash reports automatically, we collect this information without prompting you each time; on iOS, crash reports contain less information and are sent automatically to us by default. You can change your settings at any time.
More information, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can
learn more
about the studies you’re enrolled in and opt out of all (or a specific) studies at any time, and opt into experimental features through
Firefox Labs
. You can also
learn more
about the technical and interaction data we process, including how to turn it off.
To improve security
Because maintaining the latest version of Firefox helps keep you safe against vulnerabilities, desktop versions of Firefox regularly connect to Mozilla’s servers (or another service that you used to install Firefox) to check for software updates; updates for Android and iOS versions of Firefox are managed by Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store, respectively.
We also process technical data and settings data to protect against malicious add-ons.
In addition to these standard processes, we use
Google’s Safe Browsing Service
to protect you from malicious downloads and phishing attacks, and validate web page and technical data with
Certificate Authorities
. As part of our work to improve privacy and security for all internet users, we collect technical data via
OHTTP
, to better understand, prevent and defend against fingerprinting.
For
some Firefox users
, Firefox routes DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla’s
strict privacy standards for resolvers
. This provides added protection from privacy leaks to local networks and also from certain DNS security attacks. System logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution.

To understand usage of Firefox
We process
data
to better understand how you engage with our services, such as how much you use Firefox, your language preference, how often you use our search tools or interact with search suggestions, how fast pages load for you and how many ads or
CAPTCHAs
you see. This allows us to measure how people access and use our services, which helps improve our business and the functionality of Firefox.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
You can update your data collection settings for
Desktop
and
Mobile
at any time (note that deselecting “Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla” will not impact the
Daily Usage Ping
). This Daily Usage Ping solely provides us with de-identified information that a user is using Firefox and is not tied to any other data about you and can be opted out in the settings.
To market our services
When you allow us to do so, Firefox sends Mozilla data about the website domain or specific advertising campaign (if any) that referred you to our download page to help us understand and improve our marketing efforts. Firefox also shares information with our marketing partners to measure and improve these campaigns; what information is specifically shared varies (depending on how you discovered Firefox and your operating system) but generally includes how you were referred to our download page and whether you actively use Firefox. Where Firefox is pre-installed on your device, technical and interaction data (your device type and whether Firefox is used) will be sent to our marketing partners, and shared with Mozilla.
More details, including how to adjust your data settings:
Learn more about what
Campaign Measurement data
is collected and shared, and how to opt out. Note: Firefox does not share information like your browsing history, search queries, or saved passwords with marketing technology partners. Mozilla only collects the data necessary to measure and improve our marketing campaigns.
To pseudonymize, de-identify, aggregate or anonymize data
As part of the activities outlined above, such as understanding usage of Firefox and measuring our marketing, we may create pseudonymous, de-identified, aggregated or anonymized data. We use technology that is appropriate to the circumstances, including identifier removal, OHTTP, or DAP — these help prevent data from being linked to you. In some cases, we may share or publish aggregated and anonymized data to facilitate research or as part of the lawful business purposes outlined above (such as sharing aggregated insights with advertising partners).
To communicate with you
Depending on your settings (and whether or not you have a Mozilla account), we may communicate with you via in-product messaging, send you communications (including marketing-related communications), or ask you to participate in research / surveys, or respond to customer support communications. You may also reach out to us directly, such as to
report a broken site within Firefox
. When you send us personal data via these methods, we will use the information only for the purpose you provided it. We also process interaction data related to these communications to better understand who has received our service-related announcements (such as new features, updates or security alerts).
To comply with applicable laws, and identify and prevent harmful, unauthorized or illegal activity
We may also be required to process your personal data to comply with applicable laws and protection purposes, such as:
Responding to
lawful requests
and complying with
legal processes
, such as responding to subpoenas, investigations, or requests from government authorities. Mozilla requires a valid Legal Process to compel the disclosure of Specific User data to a government.
Responding to requests to exercise privacy rights, such as your right to access or delete your personal data.
Identifying, investigating and addressing potential fraudulent activities, or other harmful activities such as illegal activities, cyberattacks or intellectual property infringement (including filing or defending legal claims).
Performing internal compliance and security activities, such as audits and enterprise security management.
How is your data shared?
To provide our services as described above, we may disclose personal data to:
Partners, service providers, suppliers and contractors
To perform the purposes listed above, we work with partners, service providers, suppliers and contractors. We have contractual protections in place, so that the entities receiving personal data are contractually obligated to handle the data in accordance with Mozilla’s instructions.
Authorities
Mozilla requires a valid
Legal Process
to compel the disclosure of specific user data to a government. In those instances we may need to disclose the personal data set out in this Notice to law enforcement, government authorities, or similar entities to comply with applicable laws, and to identify and prevent harmful, unauthorized or illegal activity.
Researchers
When we are fulfilling our
mission
of being open. We sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when we do, we will do so in a de-identified or aggregated
format
.
Mozilla controlled entities and successors
As a global company, we share data across Mozilla-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We may also need to disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or similar transaction.
How long is your data kept?
We only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice. In general, we do not retain personal data for more than 25 months, but actual retention periods may vary depending on the type of data and the purpose(s) for which it was collected (for example, we retain your “first seen” date for the period of your use of Firefox, so we know how long you’ve been a Firefox user). Specific retention periods may also depend on the sensitivity of the data, the context of its collection, your settings and preferences, and our legal or contractual obligations to retain or delete your data, such as for fraud prevention, regulatory compliance, or service continuity. Once the retention period expires we securely delete your data, unless otherwise required by law.
Our services also use encrypted backup storage as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters; data in these environments is put beyond use and only processed for business continuity purposes. We may also retain data for extended periods of time on a de-identified or aggregated basis.
Your rights and choices
Your rights:
As a Firefox user, you have the right to:
Be informed about what data we process about you, why and who it’s shared with (that’s this Notice!)

Have personal data we hold about you deleted (in certain circumstances)
In some cases, restrict or object to how we use your personal data
Complain to your relevant data protection authority if you have concerns about how we’re handling your personal data. We’d prefer it if you contact us first (via
dpo@mozilla.com
), but you can also reach out to your relevant
EU data protection authority
, or search for (and contact) your local data protection authority
To make any of the above requests regarding your personal data, please contact us (Mozilla Corporation) through our
Data Subject Access Request Portal
; we will never discriminate against anyone for exercising their privacy rights. If you have any other questions regarding personal data or our privacy practices, please contact us at
compliance@mozilla.com
.

Firefox also provides
Global Privacy Control
(GPC), which you can enable to automatically notify websites not to sell or share information about your browsing session on that website. GPC operates as a “Do Not Sell” mechanism in some US states such as California, Colorado and Connecticut. It may also be used to indicate an opt-out of targeted advertising or general request to limit the sale or sharing of your personal data in those jurisdictions, as well as in jurisdictions such as the EU, UK, Nevada, Utah and Virginia.
What happens with international data transfers?
Mozilla (and our servers) are based in the United States. Because we are a global company, in order to provide the services outlined in this Privacy Notice, the information we collect may be accessed from locations where our people are located and data may also be transferred to other jurisdictions as a result of sharing data with our partners. Where appropriate, we ensure we have appropriate mechanisms in place (such as
standard contractual clauses
approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities) to protect your personal data. You can contact
dpo@mozilla.com
for information on the safeguards implemented for international transfers, or for copies of the relevant standard contractual clauses.
Applicability (Firefox version) and changes
Applicability
This Privacy Notice is for the most recent general release version of Firefox distributed by Mozilla. If you obtain Firefox elsewhere, or are running an older version, your copy of Firefox may contain different privacy characteristics.
Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox (which are distributed through channels such as Nightly, Beta, Developer Edition and TestFlight) are development platforms frequently updated with experimental features and studies. In addition to the data collection described in this Privacy Notice, these versions by default may send certain types of web activity and crash data to Mozilla (and in some cases to our partners).
Changes
We may need to change this policy and our notices, in which case the updates will be posted online and we will update the effective date of this notice. If the changes are substantive, we will also announce the update more prominently through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements, such as blog posts and forums.

This feature is experimental and is being introduced to the Firefox user base through a progressive rollout. It may not yet be available to all users.
Starting with
Firefox version
133, you have the option to use an AI chatbot of your choice in an updated
sidebar
. The sidebar allows you to keep a variety of browser tools, including a chatbot, in view as you browse. Right now, you can choose from the following chatbot providers: Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, HuggingChat by Hugging Face and Le Chat Mistral.
Each provider can help with things like summarizing what you’re reading, brainstorming ideas, and getting help writing.

what to keep in mind when using AI chatbots
, how to
select a chatbot provider
, how to

and how to
remove the AI chatbot after you've added it to Firefox
.
What to keep in mind when using AI chatbots
If you choose to use AI chatbots – whether that’s in Firefox, as an app, or in another browser – keep these things in mind:
When you use a chatbot, you are agreeing to that provider’s privacy policies and terms of use. Each chatbot provider has their own terms of use and privacy policies. View the
privacy policies and terms for providers in Firefox
.
You should verify any information you get from AI chatbots. AI chatbots are powered by generative AI which, in basic terms, predicts likely text or images based on prompts. It’s not designed or guaranteed to provide definitive facts. More about
how AI chatbots work at a high level
.
Some chatbots are more privacy-respecting than others. To learn more about protecting your privacy when you use chatbots,
follow these helpful tips from the Mozilla Foundation
.
Learn about chatbot providers
For up-to-date information about each chatbot and what it offers, each provider’s website is the best place to look. Most chatbots are experimental and frequently change how they work, how they look, and what they offer.
Also, most chatbots allow you to change different settings, such as whether your chats and information are shared with the provider. Be sure to explore these settings when using a chatbot.

Select text to see suggested prompts
Prompts are the instructions you provide to the chatbot, based on what you want it to do. We have pre-written a small number of prompts that are available when you select text.
You can access the prompts either:
When you select text and right click.
Through a shortcut that appears when you select text. (You can hide the shortcut if you want.)
If you choose a prompt, Firefox sends it plus the selected text and page title, to the chatbot you’ve chosen.
Each suggested prompt starts with this sentence, where information in [brackets] pulls in based on the page you’re on and your selection. “I’m on page [name of page you’re on] with [text you’ve selected] selected.” The rest of the prompts are as follows.
Summarize
Please summarize the selection using precise and concise language. Use headers and bulleted lists in the summary, to make it scannable. Maintain the meaning and factual accuracy.
Explain this
Please explain the key concepts in this selection, using simple words. Also, use examples.
Quiz me
Please quiz me on this selection. Ask me a variety of types of questions, for example multiple choice, true or false, and short answer. Wait for my response before moving on to the next question.
How to hide the shortcut
There are two ways to hide the shortcut. One way is to select text and then choose
Hide chatbot shortcut
.
You can also select the more menu
from the
AI chatbot
panel and select
Hide shortcut when selecting text
.
How AI chatbots work
AI chatbots are powered by technology that can generate text and images, called generative AI – also referred to as “genAI”. This technology does not pull images and text from thin air. Instead, it is trained on massive amounts of data.
When you interact with generative AI, it uses the data it’s been trained on and then predicts likely textual responses or images. The data the model has been trained on, as well as the instructions you input into the chat interface (also called “prompts”), influence and guide what will be generated.
Generative AI predicts likely outputs – but it is not designed to and not guaranteed to provide definitive facts. It generates a result based on your prompts and the data that the AI has been trained on. You should consider carefully whether your prompt is providing the result that you are looking for.
To learn more about generative AI, countless resources are available online. Here are a few suggested starting points (content in English):

Frequently asked questions
What information does Firefox send to a provider, when I use their chatbot in the sidebar?
When you open the chatbot in the sidebar, the provider collects the same information as it would if you had visited the chatbot in a regular Firefox tab. If you select text on a webpage or PDF and choose to use one of the suggested prompts, we send your text selection, prompt and page title to the provider.
Are chatbots free to use?
Each chatbot provider we provide access to has a free option. Many also offer paid options. With the free option, use of the chatbot is often restricted in some way – for example, to a certain number of conversations per day, or in the amount and type of information you can share with the chatbot.
Can I trust the information chatbots provide?
AI predicts likely outputs – but it is not designed to and not guaranteed to provide definitive facts. It generates a result based on your prompts and the data that the AI has been trained on, and can make mistakes. You should verify any information you get from chatbots. Learn more about
how AI chatbots work
.
Some chatbots are not available in my region. Why can I still choose them?
Not all chatbots are available in all regions and locales. We have chosen to not limit choice by region, since the availability of these tools is often changing.
Can the chatbot provider see the conversations I’m having? What does it do with the conversations?
This varies based on the chatbot and, in some cases, the settings you choose for the chatbot. Some chatbots offer an ‘anonymous’ mode. Others offer a way to delete your conversations.
For more information about what each provider does with your conversation and data, check out their
terms of service, privacy policies and websites
.
Is it safe to share personal information with chatbots?
We do not recommend sharing personal information with chatbots.
Can Firefox see the conversations I’m having?
No. Firefox does not have any access to your conversations with the chatbot or any information about the webpages and selected text that you may send to the chatbot via AI shortcuts. As with other features, we do collect data on how the AI chatbot feature is used to help improve Firefox. For example, we collect interaction data such as how often each provider is chosen and how often suggested prompts are used. Learn more about the
interaction and performance data Firefox collects
, which we call telemetry.
How do I remove this from Firefox?
In the sidebar, choose the settings icon
. In the
Customize sidebar
panel, uncheck the
AI chatbot
box in the
Firefox tools
section.

Mozilla Policy Requirements for DNS over HTTPs Partners
This document describes the minimum set of policy requirements that a party must satisfy to be considered as a potential partner for Mozilla’s Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) program. It specifically describes data collection and retention, transparency, and blocking policies and is in addition to any contractual, technical or operational requirements necessary to operate the resolver service.
Privacy Requirements
Mozilla’s TRR is intended to provide better, minimum privacy guarantees to Firefox users than current, ad hoc provisioning of DNS services.  As such, resolvers must strictly limit data collection and sharing from the resolver. More specifically:
1. The resolver may retain user data (including identifiable data, data associated with user IP addresses, and any non-aggregate anonymized data) but should do so only for the purpose of operating the service and must not retain that data for longer than 24 hours.
Only aggregate data that does not identify individual users or requests may be retained beyond 24 hours.
2. The resolver must not retain, sell, or transfer to any third party (except as may be required by law) any personal information, IP addresses or other user identifiers, or user query patterns from the DNS queries sent from the Firefox browser.
3. The resolver must not combine the data that it collects from queries with any other data in any way that can be used to identify individual end users.
4. The resolver must not sell, license, sublicense, or grant any rights to user data to any other person or entity.
5. The resolver must support DNS Query Name Minimisation as defined in RFC 7816.
6. The resolver must not propagate unnecessary information about queries to authoritative name servers. In particular, the client subnet DNS extension in RFC 7871 must not be sent to servers unless the connection to the authoritative server is encrypted and only to authoritative name servers operated by the domain owner directly or by a DNS provider pursuant to its contract with the domain owner.
Transparency Requirements
The party operating the resolver must be transparent about any data collection and sharing that does occur in accordance with the above requirements. More specifically:
1. Privacy Notice. There must be a public privacy notice specifically for the resolver service that documents the specific fields for data that will be retained for 24 hours and that documents specific fields for aggregate data that will be retained beyond 24 hours. The notice should also attest to requirements 2 - 4 above.
2. Transparency Report. There must be a transparency report published at least yearly that documents the policy for how the party operating the resolver will handle law enforcement requests for user data and that documents the types and number of requests received and answered, except to the extent such disclosure is prohibited by law.
Blocking & Modification Prohibitions
1. The party operating the resolver should not by default block or filter domains unless specifically required by law in the jurisdiction in which the resolver operates. Mozilla will generally seek to work with DNS resolvers that provide unfiltered DNS responses and, at its discretion, may remove from consideration resolvers subject to legal filtering obligations, depending on the scope and nature of those obligations.
Resolvers may block or filter content with the user’s explicit consent.
2. For any filtering that does occur under the above requirement, the party must maintain public documentation of all domains that are blocked and a log of when particular domains are added and removed from any blocklist.
3. When a domain requested by the user is not present, the party operating the resolver should provide an accurate NXDOMAIN response and must not modify the response or provide inaccurate responses that direct the user to alternative content.
Enforcement
The decision of who to include in (or remove from) Mozilla’s Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) program is at Mozilla’s sole discretion, and we may evaluate additional factors such as abusive practices or other security concerns not specifically identified here.  We intend to publicly document violations of this Policy and take additional actions if necessary.

Introduced in
Firefox version
120, you can make use of
Global Privacy Control
(GPC) to automatically notify websites not to sell or share information about your browsing session on that website.
GPC operates as a “Do Not Sell” mechanism in some US states such as California, Colorado and Connecticut. It may also be used to indicate an opt-out of targeted advertising or general request to limit the sale or sharing of your personal data in those jurisdictions, as well as in jurisdictions such as the EU, UK, Nevada, Utah and Virginia.
To turn on this preference:
In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click
Firefox
and then select
Preferences
or
Settings
, depending on your macOS version.
Click the menu button
and select
Settings
.
In the
Privacy & Security
panel, scroll down to
Website Privacy Preferences
and click the
Tell websites not to sell or share my data
option.
Close the
Settings
page. Any changes you've made will automatically be saved.
