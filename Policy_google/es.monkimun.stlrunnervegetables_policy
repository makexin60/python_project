1. Introduction
Lingokids is an interactive learning app and universe that surrounds your child with a modern curriculum to help them thrive in today’s changing world. At Monkimun Inc. and Monkimun Labs S.L., (collectively as data controllers “
Lingokids
,” “
we
,” “
us
,” or “
our
”), we are firmly committed to your privacy as well as the privacy of your child. We want you, as a parent and/or legal guardian (collectively “
Parent(s)
”) to feel safe and have full confidence in our handling of your data, whether you use our mobile application (“
App
”), our websites, which include our main website at
http://www.lingokids.com
, our merchandising store at store.lingokids.com and microsites and landing pages (
“Sites”
) or other services or otherwise interact with us (collectively referred to here as our “
Services
.”).
We’ve prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how and why we treat the personal information we collect, and how you can exercise your rights. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, please contact us as set forth in “
Contact Us
” below.
We may modify this Privacy Policy in accordance with applicable law at any given time. We try to always keep the Privacy Policy up to date. If we make a material change to the Privacy Policy, we’ll provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements, such as by email. Also, we will solicit and obtain verifiable parental consent if our privacy practices change in a way that such consent becomes needed.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Parents are in control.
Parents download our App and set up an account for their children as part of our initial setup process. We make it easy to see what your child is doing when they use our App.
The App is a closed ecosystem.
Our Services are not designed to allow children to access the wider internet or share any personal information with anyone other than their parent.
No ads.
We do not display any advertising within our Services.
Our promotional and store Sites are designed for adults, and we use standard web tracking technology on these Sites to support our advertising and analytics efforts.
We may partner with third parties, who use industry-standard technologies such as cookies to track visitors to our adult-oriented Sites. These third parties use this data to encourage adults to purchase our products and Services, including on other websites. As an adult, you can control this tracking by managing your cookie settings (for instance by using the cookie banner that appears on our promotional website) or otherwise by
contacting us, as described in more detail below
. We do
not
use data collected from children as part of our marketing efforts.
We strive to collect only the information we need to make our Services work.
The App does not collect any biometric identifying information such as facial geometry or voice prints. While we may invite you to take part in more in-depth research sessions (with your consent), the App will not ask for your physical location or other sensitive information, such as race, sexual orientation, or health information.
2. Information We Collect
At Lingokids, we generally collect and obtain information, including personal information, in three ways: directly from our users, automatically through your use of our Services, and from third parties in some situations. More details for each category can be found below.
A. Information You Provide to Us Directly:
Account Creation.
We may collect the following personal information when you sign up for our Services (either the free version or our Plus version paid plans) or create an account on our website:
Contact information
Contact information: adult’s e-mail address.
Adult’s year of birth
Adult’s name (optional)
Adult’s relationship with child (optional)
Player information
Child’s first name or nickname (optional)
Child’s year of birth (optional)
Payment information
We do not directly collect or store any payment card information entered through our Services, and instead rely on third-party payment processors (such as Apple or Google) to handle these payments. However, if you make a purchase on our website or subscribe to our paid plans (Plus version) of the App, we may receive certain information about your purchase, such as:
Payment method (e.g. whether you used a Credit Card/PayPal),
Full name of bank card or PayPal cardholder;
Shipping and/or Billing address;
Record of payment information for future purchases, with your consent.
Interactive Features
When you use our Services, we and others who use our Services may also collect personal information that you share directly through our interactive features (e.g., comments you may post on our social media pages). Any information you provide using the public sharing features of the Services will be considered “public,” unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced in this Privacy Policy. Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to other users. The interactive features are not present within the child-directed properties of our Services.
Voice and camera access
The App also allows Parents to enable access to the device’s microphone and camera. Voice, images, and video are never transmitted off the device or collected by Lingokids, and
Lingokids does not store and cannot access audio or visual recordings on the user’s device
. The App includes certain interactive games for which spoken responses are required to advance and complete activities. Although our speech recognition technology records and recognizes the user’s answers in order to correctly develop the activity or game and its functionalities, the technology does
not
collect any information that would identify individual speakers, such as a voice print. Moreover, the recording is only stored on your devices. This information does not travel and is not stored on our systems or servers, nor can it be accessed, played or broadcast by us.
You can check the permission settings of your device to see what information the App may access. That said, if you disable access to the device’s microphone and camera, certain features or functions of the App may not work properly.
Feedback Data
We may collect additional personal information when Parents or other adults voluntarily complete a customer survey, participate in our customer forums and panels,
or provide feedback on any of our Services.
Product and Content Research and Development Activities
On occasion, we may contact you to ask you to participate in optional interviews, surveys, or qualitative research sessions. These surveys will be conducted with your express consent only, and the categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which they are gathered will be disclosed to you in advance of each session. We will never contact your child directly without your consent.
Your Communications with Us
When you contact us, such as to request customer support or to partner with us, we may collect your name and surname, email address, and any other information you provide us during our communication.
Sweepstakes or Contests
We may collect personal information you provide for any sweepstakes or contests that we offer. In some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information (such as names and addresses) of sweepstakes and contest winners. This section does not apply to children.
Conferences, Trade Shows, and Other Events
We may collect personal information from individuals when we attend or host conferences, trade shows, and other events.
Business Development and Strategic Partnerships

Technologies
”). These technologies collect information about your use of our Services.

Cookie Policy
.
C. Data We Collect from Third Parties and Other Sources
We also obtain and receive information about you from our vendors and other third parties with whom we have relationships, both from your use of our App and from other interactions you have with us on other platforms.
Third-Party Services and Sources
. We may obtain personal information about you from third-party services and organizations. For example, if you access our services through a third-party login service such as your Apple ID, we may collect personal information about you from that third-party application or service that you have made available via your privacy settings.
Third-Party Analytics.
We use web analytics tools and services provided by our vendors and partners to support our marketing and user acquisition efforts for adults. These tools allow us to know and track audiences of adult users and potential users by looking at their interactions and visits to our Sites, the App, publications, and content on our profiles on social networks and platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest, Spotify). We may also receive information from third parties regarding the ads adults view and click on YouTube or the Internet.
Third-party Survey Platforms.
Also, when we contact you to conduct research sessions or when you participate in interviews or surveys as a Parent, your contact information (email) may be provided to us by third party platforms or agencies from user dashboards generated from databases in which you voluntarily enrolled.
3. Purposes for Processing Your Data
We use your information for a variety of business purposes, including to provide our Services, for administrative purposes, and to market our products and Services, as described below.
A. Provide Our Services
We use your information to fulfill our contract with you and provide you with our Services, such as:

Pursuing our legitimate interests such as direct marketing of similar products and services, requesting customer feedback, network and information security, and fraud prevention;
Detecting security incidents, protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecuting those responsible for that activity;
Measuring interest and engagement in our Services;
Short-term, transient use, such as contextual customization ads;

Developing new products and services;
Ensuring internal quality control and safety;
Additional information for EU residents: The legal basis for the above processing activities is the legitimate interest of our Company, taking into account your fundamental rights and freedoms with respect to your personal data.
C.

Additional information for EU residents: The legal basis for the above processing activities is Article 6(1)(c) GDPR as it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our Company is subject.
D. Marketing and Advertising our Products and Services
We do not market or advertise to children in the Services or otherwise use information collected from children or within child-directed properties of our Services of advertising.
In some cases, we may partner with third-party ad networks, publishers, and other advertising companies (“Ad Vendors”) to display our ads on other sites and apps. These ads are displayed on sites and apps based on their type or content or are displayed to certain adult audience segments (e.g. adults in a certain, estimated location or adults that use a certain operating system like iPadOs).
We may use certain personal information (e.g. IP address) collected on such third-party sites or apps and later recorded within our systems when an adult user takes certain actions within our app (e.g. installs the app or starts a free trial) to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We may also use certain personal information of adults to help determine who should see our ads. We do not use any personal information from the child-directed properties of our Services for such ads.
If you are a Parent, we may use your personal information to send you promotional content for our Services via email messages (newsletter) and if you use our App, we may also send you promotional content via push notifications, and in-app messages. The frequency of these messages and the decision to send them may depend on certain actions you as an adult take in relation to our Service (e.g. starting a trial), as well as on certain in-app or other activities, such as when you last opened the newsletter or the app.
Finally, we use cookies or similar technologies on our Sites for technical purposes and for other purposes as specified in our
Cookie Policy
. We do this with your consent where required by applicable law. We do not use cookies or similar technologies in the App for advertising purposes, however.
We never disclose your personal information to third parties for their own advertising.
Additional information for EU residents: The legal basis for the above processing activities, if ever conducted, would be your consent.
E. With Your Consent
In addition to our marketing activities described above, we
may use personal information for other purposes that are clearly disclosed to you at the time you provide personal information, or with your separate consent.
F. Other Purposes
We also use your personal information for other purposes as requested by you or as permitted by applicable law.
De-identified and Aggregated Information
. We may use personal information to create de-identified and/or aggregated information (for example, aggregate reports detailing the total number of users we have in a given jurisdiction).
4. Children’s Privacy
We know that children deserve special, enhanced privacy protections. That’s why we develop our App and Services to ensure that parents, caregivers, and guardians are in control. We require an adult to register their child and provide the child’s information to establish an account; in particular, we collect the child’s first name (optional) so that you can easily distinguish between different profiles and the child’s year of birth (optional) so that we can customize App content for the child.
Once the parent has created the child’s account, then we strive to collect only as much information about a child player as is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in the educational activities in our Services. We do not condition a child’s use of our Services on their disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary.
How We Use Your Child’s Information.
We use the information we collect to improve our App and to deliver a better and more personalized experience. For example, we may use your child’s information to:
Estimate our customer size and usage patterns.
Store information about the child’s preferences regarding the activities played in our App and context (such as language), allowing us to customize the content according to individual interests.
Generate regular reports on your child’s progress, using artificial intelligence, so that you can be part of your child’s learning journey, see your child’s strengths and areas for improvement and explore other resources inside and outside the app to support your child’s learning progress. You can object to this processing of your child’s data at any time through the channels provided.
Speed up your searches.
Our Practices for Disclosing Children’s Information.
We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer children’s personal information other than as described in this section:
If a Parent opts to share content from the app (e.g., achievements) we will provide the content via shareable links with secure tokens.
We may disclose aggregated information about many of our users, and information that does not identify any individual.
In addition, we may disclose children’s Personal Information:
To vendors we use to support the internal operations of our App, or data processors, and who are bound by contractual or other obligations to use the information only for such purpose and to keep the information confidential.
If we are required to do so by law or legal processes, such as to comply with any valid court order or subpoena or to respond to any valid request from a governmental, regulatory, or law enforcement entity.
Accessing and Correcting Your Child’s Personal Information.
At any time, you may review the child’s Personal Information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete the Personal Information, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the child’s Personal Information. You can review, change, or delete your child’s personal information by sending us a request here:
https://help.lingokids.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
or emailing us at
dpo@lingokids.com
. To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to take certain steps or provide additional information to verify your identity before we provide any information or make corrections.
If we learn that we mistakenly collected any personal information from a child (as defined based on the minimum age for data collection in their jurisdiction), we will delete it immediately, unless we have a legal obligation to retain it, and then disable the child’s account.
Lingokids is audited and certified by the
kidSAFE Seal Program
, and complies with its standards and requirements for online security and privacy. You can see Lingokids’ certification by visiting its

Such companies are data processors of Lingokids and we have proper data processing agreements in place with them.
We take appropriate contractual, legal, technical, and organizational measures designed to ensure that your personal information is treated securely.

on third-party sites or apps
and to assist in measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaign.

we may share directly, third-party advertising partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our Sites to collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day).
As an adult, you can control this tracking by managing your cookie settings (for instance by using the cookie banner that appears on our Sites) or otherwise by contacting us, as described in more detail below.

6. Retention of Your Data
We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you with our Services, and after that, as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, and during the statute of limitations for legal actions.
7. Security of Your Data
We have implemented appropriate security measures designed to ensure the security of your personal information and prevent its alteration, loss, and treatment and/or unauthorized access.
While we have implemented measures designed to secure your data, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss of personal information.

B. SALES/SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Lingokids does not “sell” personal information as the term “sell” is commonly understood. That said, we may disclose information collected from Parents to third-party advertising partners for the purpose of promoting our Services,
specifically to determine who should see our ads and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns,
as described above.
This information includes identifiers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Services), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering using our Services).
You may limit such disclosures by following the instructions found above in the section titled
“Your Choices and Rights,”
or by contacting us as set forth in

As part of this advertising, we may “share“ identifiers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our website), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing the Services) with advertising platforms and advertising networks. You may limit such disclosures by following the instructions found above in the section titled “Your Choices and Rights,” or by contacting us as set forth in “Contact Us” below.

C. SENSITIVE INFORMATION

1. Introduction
Lingokids is an interactive learning app and universe that surrounds your child with a modern curriculum to help them thrive in today’s changing world. At Monkimun Inc. and Monkimun Labs S.L., (collectively as data controllers “
Lingokids
,” “
we
,” “
us
,” or “
our
”), we are firmly committed to your privacy as well as the privacy of your child. We want you, as a parent and/or legal guardian (collectively “
Parent(s)
”) to feel safe and have full confidence in our handling of your data, whether you use our mobile application (“
App
”), our websites, which include our main website at
http://www.lingokids.com
, our merchandising store at store.lingokids.com and microsites and landing pages (
“Sites”
) or other services or otherwise interact with us (collectively referred to here as our “
Services
.”).
We’ve prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how and why we treat the personal information we collect, and how you can exercise your rights. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, please contact us as set forth in “
Contact Us
” below.
We may modify this Privacy Policy in accordance with applicable law at any given time. We try to always keep the Privacy Policy up to date. If we make a material change to the Privacy Policy, we’ll provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements, such as by email. Also, we will solicit and obtain verifiable parental consent if our privacy practices change in a way that such consent becomes needed.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Parents are in control.
Parents download our App and set up an account for their children as part of our initial setup process. We make it easy to see what your child is doing when they use our App.
The App is a closed ecosystem.
Our Services are not designed to allow children to access the wider internet or share any personal information with anyone other than their parent.
No ads.
We do not display any advertising within our Services.
Our promotional and store Sites are designed for adults, and we use standard web tracking technology on these Sites to support our advertising and analytics efforts.
We may partner with third parties, who use industry-standard technologies such as cookies to track visitors to our adult-oriented Sites. These third parties use this data to encourage adults to purchase our products and Services, including on other websites. As an adult, you can control this tracking by managing your cookie settings (for instance by using the cookie banner that appears on our promotional website) or otherwise by
contacting us, as described in more detail below
. We do
not
use data collected from children as part of our marketing efforts.
We strive to collect only the information we need to make our Services work.
The App does not collect any biometric identifying information such as facial geometry or voice prints. While we may invite you to take part in more in-depth research sessions (with your consent), the App will not ask for your physical location or other sensitive information, such as race, sexual orientation, or health information.
2. Information We Collect
At Lingokids, we generally collect and obtain information, including personal information, in three ways: directly from our users, automatically through your use of our Services, and from third parties in some situations. More details for each category can be found below.
A. Information You Provide to Us Directly:
Account Creation.
We may collect the following personal information when you sign up for our Services (either the free version or our Plus version paid plans) or create an account on our website:
Contact information
Contact information: adult’s e-mail address.
Adult’s year of birth
Adult’s name (optional)
Adult’s relationship with child (optional)
Player information
Child’s first name or nickname (optional)
Child’s year of birth (optional)
Payment information
We do not directly collect or store any payment card information entered through our Services, and instead rely on third-party payment processors (such as Apple or Google) to handle these payments. However, if you make a purchase on our website or subscribe to our paid plans (Plus version) of the App, we may receive certain information about your purchase, such as:
Payment method (e.g. whether you used a Credit Card/PayPal),
Full name of bank card or PayPal cardholder;
Shipping and/or Billing address;
Record of payment information for future purchases, with your consent.
Interactive Features
When you use our Services, we and others who use our Services may also collect personal information that you share directly through our interactive features (e.g., comments you may post on our social media pages). Any information you provide using the public sharing features of the Services will be considered “public,” unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced in this Privacy Policy. Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to other users. The interactive features are not present within the child-directed properties of our Services.
Voice and camera access
The App also allows Parents to enable access to the device’s microphone and camera. Voice, images, and video are never transmitted off the device or collected by Lingokids, and
Lingokids does not store and cannot access audio or visual recordings on the user’s device
. The App includes certain interactive games for which spoken responses are required to advance and complete activities. Although our speech recognition technology records and recognizes the user’s answers in order to correctly develop the activity or game and its functionalities, the technology does
not
collect any information that would identify individual speakers, such as a voice print. Moreover, the recording is only stored on your devices. This information does not travel and is not stored on our systems or servers, nor can it be accessed, played or broadcast by us.
You can check the permission settings of your device to see what information the App may access. That said, if you disable access to the device’s microphone and camera, certain features or functions of the App may not work properly.
Feedback Data
We may collect additional personal information when Parents or other adults voluntarily complete a customer survey, participate in our customer forums and panels,
or provide feedback on any of our Services.
Product and Content Research and Development Activities
On occasion, we may contact you to ask you to participate in optional interviews, surveys, or qualitative research sessions. These surveys will be conducted with your express consent only, and the categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which they are gathered will be disclosed to you in advance of each session. We will never contact your child directly without your consent.
Your Communications with Us
When you contact us, such as to request customer support or to partner with us, we may collect your name and surname, email address, and any other information you provide us during our communication.
Sweepstakes or Contests
We may collect personal information you provide for any sweepstakes or contests that we offer. In some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information (such as names and addresses) of sweepstakes and contest winners. This section does not apply to children.
Conferences, Trade Shows, and Other Events
We may collect personal information from individuals when we attend or host conferences, trade shows, and other events.
Business Development and Strategic Partnerships
We may collect personal information from individuals and third parties to assess and pursue potential business opportunities.

Technologies
”). These technologies collect information about your use of our Services.

Cookie Policy
.
C. Data We Collect from Third Parties and Other Sources
We also obtain and receive information about you from our vendors and other third parties with whom we have relationships, both from your use of our App and from other interactions you have with us on other platforms.
Third-Party Services and Sources
. We may obtain personal information about you from third-party services and organizations. For example, if you access our services through a third-party login service such as your Apple ID, we may collect personal information about you from that third-party application or service that you have made available via your privacy settings.
Third-Party Analytics.
We use web analytics tools and services provided by our vendors and partners to support our marketing and user acquisition efforts for adults. These tools allow us to know and track audiences of adult users and potential users by looking at their interactions and visits to our Sites, the App, publications, and content on our profiles on social networks and platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest, Spotify). We may also receive information from third parties regarding the ads adults view and click on YouTube or the Internet.
Third-party Survey Platforms.
Also, when we contact you to conduct research sessions or when you participate in interviews or surveys as a Parent, your contact information (email) may be provided to us by third party platforms or agencies from user dashboards generated from databases in which you voluntarily enrolled.
3. Purposes for Processing Your Data

D. Marketing and Advertising our Products and Services
We do not market or advertise to children in the Services or otherwise use information collected from children or within child-directed properties of our Services of advertising.
In some cases, we may partner with third-party ad networks, publishers, and other advertising companies (“Ad Vendors”) to display our ads on other sites and apps. These ads are displayed on sites and apps based on their type or content or are displayed to certain adult audience segments (e.g. adults in a certain, estimated location or adults that use a certain operating system like iPadOs).
We may use certain personal information (e.g. IP address) collected on such third-party sites or apps and later recorded within our systems when an adult user takes certain actions within our app (e.g. installs the app or starts a free trial) to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We may also use certain personal information of adults to help determine who should see our ads. We do not use any personal information from the child-directed properties of our Services for such ads.
If you are a Parent, we may use your personal information to send you promotional content for our Services via email messages (newsletter) and if you use our App, we may also send you promotional content via push notifications, and in-app messages. The frequency of these messages and the decision to send them may depend on certain actions you as an adult take in relation to our Service (e.g. starting a trial), as well as on certain in-app or other activities, such as when you last opened the newsletter or the app.
Finally, we use cookies or similar technologies on our Sites for technical purposes and for other purposes as specified in our
Cookie Policy
. We do this with your consent where required by applicable law. We do not use cookies or similar technologies in the App for advertising purposes, however.
We never disclose your personal information to third parties for their own advertising.
Additional information for EU residents: The legal basis for the above processing activities, if ever conducted, would be your consent.
E. With Your Consent

may use personal information for other purposes that are clearly disclosed to you at the time you provide personal information, or with your separate consent.
F. Other Purposes
We also use your personal information for other purposes as requested by you or as permitted by applicable law.
De-identified and Aggregated Information
. We may use personal information to create de-identified and/or aggregated information (for example, aggregate reports detailing the total number of users we have in a given jurisdiction).
4. Children’s Privacy
We know that children deserve special, enhanced privacy protections. That’s why we develop our App and Services to ensure that parents, caregivers, and guardians are in control. We require an adult to register their child and provide the child’s information to establish an account; in particular, we collect the child’s first name (optional) so that you can easily distinguish between different profiles and the child’s year of birth (optional) so that we can customize App content for the child.
Once the parent has created the child’s account, then we strive to collect only as much information about a child player as is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in the educational activities in our Services. We do not condition a child’s use of our Services on their disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary.
How We Use Your Child’s Information.
We use the information we collect to improve our App and to deliver a better and more personalized experience. For example, we may use your child’s information to:
Estimate our customer size and usage patterns.
Store information about the child’s preferences regarding the activities played in our App and context (such as language), allowing us to customize the content according to individual interests.
Generate regular reports on your child’s progress, using artificial intelligence, so that you can be part of your child’s learning journey, see your child’s strengths and areas for improvement and explore other resources inside and outside the app to support your child’s learning progress. You can object to this processing of your child’s data at any time through the channels provided.
Speed up your searches.
Our Practices for Disclosing Children’s Information.
We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer children’s personal information other than as described in this section:
If a Parent opts to share content from the app (e.g., achievements) we will provide the content via shareable links with secure tokens.
We may disclose aggregated information about many of our users, and information that does not identify any individual.
In addition, we may disclose children’s Personal Information:
To vendors we use to support the internal operations of our App, or data processors, and who are bound by contractual or other obligations to use the information only for such purpose and to keep the information confidential.
If we are required to do so by law or legal processes, such as to comply with any valid court order or subpoena or to respond to any valid request from a governmental, regulatory, or law enforcement entity.
Accessing and Correcting Your Child’s Personal Information.
At any time, you may review the child’s Personal Information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete the Personal Information, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the child’s Personal Information. You can review, change, or delete your child’s personal information by sending us a request here:
https://help.lingokids.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
or emailing us at
dpo@lingokids.com
. To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to take certain steps or provide additional information to verify your identity before we provide any information or make corrections.
If we learn that we mistakenly collected any personal information from a child (as defined based on the minimum age for data collection in their jurisdiction), we will delete it immediately, unless we have a legal obligation to retain it, and then disable the child’s account.

on third-party sites or apps
and to assist in measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaign.

collected within our App
we may share directly, third-party advertising partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our Sites to collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day).
As an adult, you can control this tracking by managing your cookie settings (for instance by using the cookie banner that appears on our Sites) or otherwise by contacting us, as described in more detail below.

D. Disclosures to Protect Us or Others

6. Retention of Your Data
We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you with our Services, and after that, as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, and during the statute of limitations for legal actions.
7. Security of Your Data
We have implemented appropriate security measures designed to ensure the security of your personal information and prevent its alteration, loss, and treatment and/or unauthorized access.
While we have implemented measures designed to secure your data, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss of personal information.
By using our Services or providing personal information to us and to the extent permitted by law, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of our Services.

specifically to determine who should see our ads and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns,
as described above.
This information includes identifiers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Services), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering using our Services).
You may limit such disclosures by following the instructions found above in the section titled
“Your Choices and Rights,”
or by contacting us as set forth in
“Contact Us”
below.
The CCPA also requires businesses that “share“ personal information to provide an opt out from such sharing. Under the CCPA,” sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites. We “share” information collected from Parents for these purposes to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding the Services. As part of this advertising, we may “share“ identifiers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our website), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing the Services) with advertising platforms and advertising networks. You may limit such disclosures by following the instructions found above in the section titled “Your Choices and Rights,” or by contacting us as set forth in “Contact Us” below.
We do not have actual knowledge of any “sale” or “share” of personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
C. SENSITIVE INFORMATION
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA
D. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES

If we are unable to process your request via you authenticating yourself on the Services, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.

These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time. In order to withdraw from the financial incentive, please

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
