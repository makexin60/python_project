California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States that requires commercial websites and
                            online services to publish a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond
                            California to require any individual or company in the US (and conceivably the
                            world) that operates sites collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous
                            privacy policy on its website stating precisely the information that it collects and those
                            individuals or companies with whom it is shared.
For further information, visit:
                            https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
Users can visit the site anonymously.
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or at
                                least, the first significant page after entering our website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' in it, and it can easily be found
                                on the page specified above.
Fair Information Practices
The Fair Information Practices Principles is the backbone of the privacy law in the United
                            States. It also plays a significant role in developing data protection laws across the
                            globe. It is, therefore, essential to understand the Fair Information Practice
                            Principles and how they should be implemented in compliance with the various privacy laws to
                            protect personal information.
In agreement with the Fair Information Practices, following responsive actions will be taken,
                            should a data breach instance occur:
We will notify you via email:
Within 7 business days
We will notify the users via in-site notification
Within 7 business days
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle according to which individuals have the
                            right to legally pursue enforceable rights against those who collect and process data and
                            fail to adhere to the law. As per this principle individuals not only
                            have enforceable rights against data users but also that they have recourse to courts or
                            legal agencies to investigate and/or prosecute by data processors.
