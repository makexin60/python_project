2. INFORMATION COLLECTED
Personal Information The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories:

We may use this information to personalize and improve our services, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. We may Jet Playere this information to our partners, so that they, too, can Jet Playere you with an optimal experience, but we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

Jet Player may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain Non-Personal Information that does not directly enable Jet Player to identify you.

(i) device properties, including, but not limited to IP address, unique device identifier or other persistent or non-persistent device identifier ("Device ID");
(ii) device software platform and firmware;

(v) other Non-Personal Information as reasonably required by Jet Player to enhance the Services and other Jet Player products and services.
Cookies Jet Player treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal information. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, email addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.
3. DISCLOSING AND HOSTING INFORMATION
In addition to the disclosures described herein, we may release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right voluntarily or involuntarily to make all lawful, worldwide uses of Personal Information, including without limitation, to: collect, use, access (or bar access), process, fulfill, disclose, display, share, respond to legal process or otherwise exercise our rights under applicable law, transfer, store, sell, lease, retain, commingle, investigate, verify, prove, enforce, delete, and otherwise deal with Personal Information, and information other than Personal Information.
4. COLLECTION AND USE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION
The Services comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Jet Player does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Services. In addition, in the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within the Services or in connection with any Content or Software, Jet Player will not collect, store or use any personal information of such user. Further, in the event that Jet Player receives personal information that Jet Player discovers was Jet Playered by a child under the age of 13, Jet Player will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.
5. SAFEGUARDS
Jet Player maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal information we collect and store about our account holders, including children under 13.
