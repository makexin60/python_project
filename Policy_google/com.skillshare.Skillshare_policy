About This Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) details our data collection processes, including the data we receive about you and how we process it, and your rights and obligations in relation to your personal data.
Unless we link to a different policy or state otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies when you visit or use the Skillshare services such as any Skillshare website or the website of a Skillshare owned and operated platform (the “Site”), community and customer service links or chat functionality, mobile applications, social media pages or handles, online and offline products and events, APIs or related services, and any accompanying services you are eligible to receive, such as teacher support services and tools (together, the “Services”). It also applies to prospective customers and enterprise products. By using or accessing the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Privacy Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.
Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings set forth in the
Terms of Service
(the “Terms”). Your use of the Sites and Services is also subject to the Terms. You shouldn’t use the Services if you don’t agree with this Privacy Policy or any other agreement that governs your use of the Services, including the Governing Documents.
Personal Data We Collect About You
When you register with us, when you become a Skillshare Member or a member of any Skillshare owned or operated platform, when you choose to teach, attend, or host a class or Event (as defined in our
Terms of Service
), when you offer content or services for sale on Skillshare or a Skillshare owned or operated platform, or when you engage with Skillshare-sponsored webpages, including those involving surveys or quizzes, we may ask you for Personal Data. “Personal Data” refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. In addition, we may collect data that is not identifiable to you or otherwise associated with you, such as aggregated data. This is not Personal Data. To the extent this data is stored or associated with Personal Data, it will be treated as Personal Data; otherwise, the data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
These tables set out the categories of personal data we collect and use.

Legal Bases for use of Your Information
We process Personal Data for, or based on, one or more of the following legal bases:
Performance of a Contract
By using the Services, you have contracted with us through the Terms of Service, and we will process certain Personal Data to perform under that contract, including first and last name, email address, password, location information, and, if you are a Teacher, the content of your classes or other materials or services you publish or offer on the Services. When we process Personal Data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.
Legitimate Interests
We process the following categories of Personal Data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties: first and last name, email address, location information, IP address, and your activity on the Services, including class usage information and community interaction data. Examples of these legitimate interests include: operation and improvement of our business, products, and services; personalization of web content on the Services; analyzing the use of the Services; marketing of our products and Services; provision of customer support; protection from fraud or security threats; compliance with legal obligations; and completion of corporate transactions.
Consent
In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us prior to the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you prior to the point and time of collection.
Other Processing Grounds
From time to time, we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
Retention of Your Information
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes. We will also retain and use your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Protection of Your Information
Skillshare takes technical and organizational security measures that are designed to safeguard Personal Data. However, no online activity is ever fully secure or error-free. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Data is absolutely secure. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information to Skillshare.
Please recognize that protecting your Personal Data is also your responsibility. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your information when you are on the Internet, or when you communicate with us and with others through the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account might have been compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately by contacting us as indicated in the Contact Us section below.
Transfer to Other Countries
Because of the global nature of our business, Skillshare shares personal data internationally with its subsidiaries, subcontractors, and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools and transfer agreements to:
make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law; and
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live.
Regardless of where you use our Services, the information collected as part of that use will be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the United States. By using our Services, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the United States.

We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, pixels, session replay/screen capture, and similar technologies on our Site to collect information and personalize your experience with our Services, to conduct analytics and marketing activities, and to provide you with targeted advertisements.
We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site that enable us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions.
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated or to block cookies altogether. For more information, please consult the “Help” section of your browser (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari).

Children's Information
The Services are not directed to children whose age:
is under the age of 13 years;
makes it illegal to process their personal data; or
requires parental consent to process their personal data.
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children who meet those criteria. If you're under the age of 13 years, please do not use the Services, and do not provide any personal data to us. We may offer a specific service dedicated to children and your use of that service will be subject to the privacy policy governing that service.
We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. If you live in the EU and are under the age of 16 years, please do not use the Services, and do not provide any personal data to us.
We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.
If you're a parent of a child under the age of 13 or 16, as applicable, and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Skillshare, please
contact us
. If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 or 16, as applicable, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Skillshare account associated with that personal data.
Your Rights
You have certain rights regarding the collection and processing of Personal Data. You may exercise these rights, to the extent they apply to you, by contacting us at the information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy, or by following instructions provided in this Privacy Policy or in communications sent to you.
Your rights vary depending on the laws that apply to you, but may include:
The right to know whether, and for what purposes, we process your Personal Data;
The right to be informed about the Personal Data we collect and/or process about you;
The right to learn the source of Personal Data about you we process;
The right to access, modify, correct, and delete Personal Data about you (see the “Accessing, Modifying, and Correcting Collected Personal Data” section below for more information);
The right to know with whom we have shared your Personal Data, for what purposes, and what Personal Data has been shared (including whether Personal Data was disclosed to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes);
The right to withdraw your consent, where processing of Personal Data is based on your consent; and
The right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority located in the jurisdiction of your habitual residence, place of work, or where an alleged violation of law occurred.
We may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as free trial fraud. We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes, and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.
We currently do not collect household data. If all the members of a household make a request under this Policy, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.
Please note, if you do not have a Skillshare account or other Skillshare owned or operated platform account, we will not have enough information about you to verify your requests under this Policy, as we do not keep sufficient information necessary to reidentify and link you to a prior visit to Skillshare where data may have been collected. As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests. You may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information twice per 12-month period.

For example, if we suspend an account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain information from that account to prevent that member from opening a new account in the future.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep information for tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations.
Some copies of your information (e.g., log records) will remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.

About This Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) details our data collection processes, including the data we receive about you and how we process it, and your rights and obligations in relation to your personal data.
Unless we link to a different policy or state otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies when you visit or use the Skillshare services such as any Skillshare website or the website of a Skillshare owned and operated platform (the “Site”), community and customer service links or chat functionality, mobile applications, social media pages or handles, online and offline products and events, APIs or related services, and any accompanying services you are eligible to receive, such as teacher support services and tools (together, the “Services”). It also applies to prospective customers and enterprise products. By using or accessing the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Privacy Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.
Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings set forth in the
Terms of Service
(the “Terms”). Your use of the Sites and Services is also subject to the Terms. You shouldn’t use the Services if you don’t agree with this Privacy Policy or any other agreement that governs your use of the Services, including the Governing Documents.

Terms of Service
), when you offer content or services for sale on Skillshare or a Skillshare owned or operated platform, or when you engage with Skillshare-sponsored webpages, including those involving surveys or quizzes, we may ask you for Personal Data. “Personal Data” refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. In addition, we may collect data that is not identifiable to you or otherwise associated with you, such as aggregated data. This is not Personal Data.

Other Processing Grounds
From time to time, we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
Retention of Your Information
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes.

Protection of Your Information
Skillshare takes technical and organizational security measures that are designed to safeguard Personal Data. However, no online activity is ever fully secure or error-free. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Data is absolutely secure. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information to Skillshare.
Please recognize that protecting your Personal Data is also your responsibility. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your information when you are on the Internet, or when you communicate with us and with others through the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account might have been compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately by contacting us as indicated in the Contact Us section below.
Transfer to Other Countries
Because of the global nature of our business, Skillshare shares personal data internationally with its subsidiaries, subcontractors, and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools and transfer agreements to:
make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law; and
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live.
Regardless of where you use our Services, the information collected as part of that use will be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the United States. By using our Services, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the United States.

We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site that enable us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions.

Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated or to block cookies altogether. For more information, please consult the “Help” section of your browser (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari).

Children's Information
The Services are not directed to children whose age:

We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children who meet those criteria. If you're under the age of 13 years, please do not use the Services, and do not provide any personal data to us. We may offer a specific service dedicated to children and your use of that service will be subject to the privacy policy governing that service.
We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. If you live in the EU and are under the age of 16 years, please do not use the Services, and do not provide any personal data to us.
We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.
If you're a parent of a child under the age of 13 or 16, as applicable, and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Skillshare, please
contact us
. If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 or 16, as applicable, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Skillshare account associated with that personal data.
Your Rights
You have certain rights regarding the collection and processing of Personal Data. You may exercise these rights, to the extent they apply to you, by contacting us at the information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy, or by following instructions provided in this Privacy Policy or in communications sent to you.
Your rights vary depending on the laws that apply to you, but may include:
The right to know whether, and for what purposes, we process your Personal Data;
The right to be informed about the Personal Data we collect and/or process about you;
The right to learn the source of Personal Data about you we process;
The right to access, modify, correct, and delete Personal Data about you (see the “Accessing, Modifying, and Correcting Collected Personal Data” section below for more information);
The right to know with whom we have shared your Personal Data, for what purposes, and what Personal Data has been shared (including whether Personal Data was disclosed to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes);
The right to withdraw your consent, where processing of Personal Data is based on your consent; and
The right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority located in the jurisdiction of your habitual residence, place of work, or where an alleged violation of law occurred.
We may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as free trial fraud. We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes, and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.
We currently do not collect household data. If all the members of a household make a request under this Policy, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.
Please note, if you do not have a Skillshare account or other Skillshare owned or operated platform account, we will not have enough information about you to verify your requests under this Policy, as we do not keep sufficient information necessary to reidentify and link you to a prior visit to Skillshare where data may have been collected. As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests. You may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information twice per 12-month period.

When we process Personal Data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.
Legitimate Interests
We process the following categories of Personal Data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties: first and last name, email address, location information, IP address, and your activity on the Services, including class usage information and community interaction data. Examples of these legitimate interests include: operation and improvement of our business, products, and services; personalization of web content on the Services; analyzing the use of the Services; marketing of our products and Services; provision of customer support; protection from fraud or security threats; compliance with legal obligations; and completion of corporate transactions.
Consent
In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us prior to the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you prior to the point and time of collection.
Other Processing Grounds
From time to time, we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
Retention of Your Information
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes. We will also retain and use your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Protection of Your Information
Skillshare takes technical and organizational security measures that are designed to safeguard Personal Data. However, no online activity is ever fully secure or error-free. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Data is absolutely secure. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information to Skillshare.
Please recognize that protecting your Personal Data is also your responsibility. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your information when you are on the Internet, or when you communicate with us and with others through the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account might have been compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately by contacting us as indicated in the Contact Us section below.
Transfer to Other Countries
Because of the global nature of our business, Skillshare shares personal data internationally with its subsidiaries, subcontractors, and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools and transfer agreements to:
make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law; and
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live.
Regardless of where you use our Services, the information collected as part of that use will be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the United States. By using our Services, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the United States.

Children's Information
The Services are not directed to children whose age:
is under the age of 13 years;

requires parental consent to process their personal data.
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children who meet those criteria. If you're under the age of 13 years, please do not use the Services, and do not provide any personal data to us. We may offer a specific service dedicated to children and your use of that service will be subject to the privacy policy governing that service.
We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. If you live in the EU and are under the age of 16 years, please do not use the Services, and do not provide any personal data to us.
We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.
If you're a parent of a child under the age of 13 or 16, as applicable, and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Skillshare, please
contact us
. If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 or 16, as applicable, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Skillshare account associated with that personal data.
Your Rights
You have certain rights regarding the collection and processing of Personal Data. You may exercise these rights, to the extent they apply to you, by contacting us at the information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy, or by following instructions provided in this Privacy Policy or in communications sent to you.
Your rights vary depending on the laws that apply to you, but may include:
The right to know whether, and for what purposes, we process your Personal Data;
The right to be informed about the Personal Data we collect and/or process about you;
The right to learn the source of Personal Data about you we process;
The right to access, modify, correct, and delete Personal Data about you (see the “Accessing, Modifying, and Correcting Collected Personal Data” section below for more information);
The right to know with whom we have shared your Personal Data, for what purposes, and what Personal Data has been shared (including whether Personal Data was disclosed to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes);
The right to withdraw your consent, where processing of Personal Data is based on your consent; and
The right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority located in the jurisdiction of your habitual residence, place of work, or where an alleged violation of law occurred.
We may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as free trial fraud. We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes, and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.
We currently do not collect household data. If all the members of a household make a request under this Policy, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.
Please note, if you do not have a Skillshare account or other Skillshare owned or operated platform account, we will not have enough information about you to verify your requests under this Policy, as we do not keep sufficient information necessary to reidentify and link you to a prior visit to Skillshare where data may have been collected. As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests. You may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information twice per 12-month period.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
