WiFi Widget Privacy Policy
WiFi Widget is an open source Android app developed by me, Janek Zangenberg, alias w2sv (W2SV). The
code is
available on
GitHub
- the very webpage you are currently at -
under the
GPL-3.0 license
.
WiFi Widget does not collect, let alone share, data of whichever kind.
In-app configurations made by you are stored locally on your device, and will thus
remain entirely private. The entirety of your sensible network information, which is
displayed on the widget, is not getting stored, let alone shared, either. Instead, it is retrieved,
displayed and thereupon discarded.
WiFi Widget requires location access permission if you want your SSID to be displayed amongst the
widget WiFi properties. This is due to the fact, that knowing your SSID enables tracking your
devices approximate location by means of SSID fingerprinting. By the same token, the "Location:
Allow all the time" permission is required, if you want your SSID to be reliably updated from the
widget and without opening the app itself, since that means, that the SSID will have to be
retrieved from a background process.
If granted, the location access permission is exclusively used for the retrieval of the SSID.
Neither are records of your device's position created, nor stored, nor shared.
Furthermore, the display of the SSID may simply be disabled if you don't need it to be displayed on
the
widget, or don't feel comfortable with granting location access permission. In that case, location
access
becomes completely pointless for the functionality of the app, and it'll work perfectly fine without
it.
Should you have any doubts or general inquiries regarding the above stated privacy policy, feel free

Sincerely,
Janek Zangenberg
