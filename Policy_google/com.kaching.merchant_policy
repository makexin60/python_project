we

us
,” or “

”) is an affiliate marketing company and is part of Publicis Groupe. We’ve created this resource to provide you with valuable transparency and choice on how we might collect, use, and share your personal information as a consumer (or visitor) to the website(s) of one of our affiliate publishers or advertisers.
Scope of this Privacy Notice
To make some of our services possible and to make smarter decisions, we need to process consumer personal information. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe how your personal information as a consumer is collected and used by CJ while providing our affiliate marketing services. We believe that your privacy and data protection is essential to the growth and prosperity of the internet, and that a great online experience can provide significant benefits to consumers when done properly. In accordance with these beliefs, CJ strives to create results for publishers, advertisers and consumers in revolutionary ways without compromising privacy.
This Privacy Notice is created and maintained as part of our commitment to provide you with transparency and choice on how we process their personal information. We have taken steps to describe our personal information processing activities as clearly and easy-to-read as possible and encourage you to read the entire Privacy Notice. If you still have questions about our privacy practices, you can always contact us at

I. Overview of CJ and Affiliate Marketing
When you visit websites and mobile applications, there are almost always third parties working behind the scenes to help provide a great digital experience. CJ is one of these companies and we offer affiliate marketing technology and services that keeps your favorite blogs free, your favorite stores in business, and your experience with brands more relevant. To learn more about CJ and affiliate marketing, watch
this video
.
1. What do we do?
Affiliate marketing is the process of a brand (for example, a retailer) paying a commission to a publisher (for example a blog or a news site) for the transactions the publisher helps to drive by promoting the brand’s products or services . Publishers will promote products or services from advertisers to visitors of their properties (examples include websites or mobile applications) and earn a piece of the profit for each transaction generated. CJ operates an
affiliate network
, which helps publishers and advertisers partner with each other. An affiliate network is the platform used by publishers and advertisers to discover and form new partnerships, define criteria for qualified marketing efforts and is used to ensure that appropriate parties are rewarded for qualified activities.
2. Privacy by Design
We have a deep-rooted foundation and culture of privacy and data protection at CJ. We integrate privacy in all aspects of our business, including strategy, product development, delivery, and more. We set a ‘privacy-first’ tone early and often, proactively working to limit our data collection to what is necessary to provide our services.
In that spirit, CJ does
not
collect, store, process, or allow in our systems any of your personal information that is linked, or is intended to be linked, to an identified individual, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, driver’s license numbers, or financial account numbers, which we define as directly identifiable information (
“DII”
). We have built, and continue to build, all our products and services without the use of
any
DII.
As part of our Privacy by Design philosophy, we consider and prioritize data protection and privacy throughout the entire lifecycle of the data from before it is collected to when it is ultimately destroyed. We constantly strive to maintain unparalleled visibility with consumers. We provide transparency and choice through our website and encourage the same practice throughout the internet.
II. Information Collection & Use
Unless voluntarily provided by you, CJ does not collect or use any DII. Instead, CJ only processes
pseudonymous
personal information. Pseudonymous or pseudonymized personal information is information that does not directly identify a specific consumer without the use of additional information. CJ only collects and processes personal information in a pseudonymous format and has both technical and organizational measures in place to make sure that additional information is not used to identify or link that pseudonymous information to an identified consumer.
Some examples of pseudonymous information that we process include IP addresses, Cookie IDs, or referring site website addresses, order IDs, and browsing activity. We do not link or attribute pseudonymous information to DII, such as a your name, email address, or phone number.
Using pseudonymous information allows us to see and understand your journey between publishers and advertisers without revealing to us your identity. In other words, we do not directly identify you using the pseudonymous information that we process. In fact, we have no interest in knowing your DII details, and we work to proactively keep such information out of our systems. We will only ever collect DII if it is expressly provided to us, such as when you contacts us on your own initiative via our contact form or otherwise. Even in these instances, we will not tie this DII to pseudonymous information about you that we may have, such as your site browsing or transaction data.
1. Pseudonymous Information Collected by CJ
The majority of the data that CJ processes is machine generated and is collected when a consumer visits and interacts with one of our advertisers or publishers, such as a website or mobile application that leverages our services. Such information includes the following:
·
Commercial or transactions information:
E.g.
, information relating to online purchases and actions made by you, order IDs, order timestamps, and other purchasing information of products and services.
·
Identifiers and Device Information:
E.g.
, hashed emails, mobile identifiers (such as IDFA or AAID), Cookie IDs, user agent strings which provides browser type and version, and IP address.
·
Online browsing activity information:
E.g.
, browsing activity and information on your interaction with a website, application, or advertisement where our technology is deployed, such as clicks, ad impressions, time stamps, referring site URLs, and current site URLs.
·
Location data
:
E.g.,
location information based on IP addresses.
2. How CJ Collects Pseudonymous Information
Information Collected Online:
We collect the types of pseudonymous information identified above in a variety of ways. However, we principally use
Reporting Technologies
, such as
cookies, pixels, tags
, or other similar technologies to collect the pseudonymous information we need to provide our services. We leverage these technologies to collect the necessary pseudonymous information from you directly as you navigate or interact with our advertisers and publishers.
Information Received from Clients:
Our clients may also provide us with information relating to their customers, prospective customers, or other individuals, which we handle on the behalf of our clients as a service provider. Our clients are independently responsible to determine how they engage with their customers and determine the handling of their customer data. Under these circumstances, the use of such personal information is subject to the privacy policies of the client’s privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our clients, and accordingly, this Privacy Policy and the rights acknowledged herein do not apply to the data that CJ handles on behalf its clients.
3. CJ’s Purposes for Collecting Pseudonymous Information
CJ collects pseudonymized personal information for a variety of purposes, as detailed below.
Attribution:
CJ primarily uses pseudonymous information to attribute a referral or marketing effort by a publisher to an event or transaction with an advertiser. When a consumer responds to or views an affiliate advertisement served by one of our publishers, we may assign a unique identifier that is tied to that consumer’s internet browser or device, often via a cookie or similar technology. One function of these technologies is to provide CJ with the information needed to facilitate the verification and payment of affiliate commissions to a publisher when a consumer clicks on a link, creates a lead, or makes a purchase directly on an advertiser’s website. Even if the consumer re-visits the advertiser's site directly, CJ is able to recognize the unique identifier assigned earlier, and is able to continue to attribute the consumer’s activities on the advertiser's site and credit the publisher that referred the consumer where appropriate. In other words, if a consumer reads a blog about a pair of shoes and decides to visit that advertiser’s website and purchase that pair of shoes, we would ensure that the blog gets compensated for referring the consumer to that advertiser’s website.
Cross-Device Reporting:
We may also collect pseudonymous information across multiple browsers or devices to help us more accurately credit a publisher for their referral or marketing effort. Our cross-device reporting allows us to follow a your journey from a publisher to a potential transaction even if you decide to switch browsers or devices throughout that journey. For example, if you interact with a blog post on your phone referring them to purchase a certain pair of shoes, but later decide to switch to a desktop computer to make the purchase, we would be able to leverage our cross-device reporting technologies to ensure that the blog site is credited for the referral.
Insights and Analytics:
CJ also uses the pseudonymous information collected to provide our publishers and advertisers with reports to help with their marketing efforts. This information is generally used by our clients to enhance their ad campaigns, such as by learning where the optimal ad placement is on their website, or learning what type of products or services consumers are more interested in. We will generally aggregate or de-identify any pseudonymous information prior to compiling these reports so that it is no longer technically feasible for the data to be linked to you, your device, or your household (“
aggregated information
”). For example, to measure the effectiveness of an ad or ad campaign, we may compile a report indicating how many unique individuals clicked on an ad. The report, in this example, would only consist of the ad itself and the total number of unique clicks, with no means for the recipient of the report to relate the clicks back to any particular individual. While many of these reports are at the aggregate level, we also produce reports that contain customer-level pseudonymous information. These reports can help our clients identify areas of growth, such as identifying new partnerships or customer audiences.
Internal Business Purposes:
CJ may also collect and process personal information for some of our internal business purposes, such as:
·
Auditing transactions, such as, counting ad impressions, verifying positioning and quality of ad impressions.
·
Auditing our systems and services for compliance with applicable regulations and standards.
·
Detecting security incidents, protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecuting those responsible for that activity.
·
Debugging to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
·
Short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, the contextual customization of ads shown as part of a single interaction.
·
Performing services on behalf of our advertisers or publishers, such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service.
·
Undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration.
·
Undertaking activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of our systems and services, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance our systems and services.
·
Other purposes as required or permitted by applicable law, or with your consent.

IV. Protecting Personal Information
In addition to our Privacy by Design philosophy, CJ takes extra steps to ensure that any personal information collected and retained is secured and protected from unauthorized access.
1. Security and Data Integrity
CJ takes steps to help ensure that the data we possess is housed and transmitted securely. This may include various types of physical and electronic security, including firewall protections, encryption, hashing or truncation of data, and access controls to personal information. While neither we nor any platform can guarantee 100 percent safety from hacks or illegal intrusion, we employ efforts that are designed to ensure that this does not occur.

V. Notice to California Residents

Awin Consumers
How do we use data from end users?
Awin primarily uses end user data for the purpose of tracking an end user from a Publisher to an Advertiser. Tracking enables Awin and ShareASale to see that an end user has visited a publisher's service, found a product/service, and clicked the link to be taken to the advertiser's service to review or purchase the product/service.
The purpose of tracking is to attribute sales and marketing effort by a Publisher to a particular transaction, to enable Advertisers to reward Publishers on a per transaction basis. Tracking also allows Awin to provide Publishers and Advertisers with related reports. The majority of these reports contain only aggregated statistical data.
Awin doesn’t know who the end user is, simply that the same end user started their journey with the Publisher and completed it with the Advertiser and that the affiliate marketing campaign was therefore successful in respect of that end user.
By maintaining a limited user profile which does not reveal an end user’s name or identity, Awin can also understand an end user journey when it starts on one device, and ends on a different device. Through this functionality, Awin can understand whether a referral is commenced on one device and completed on another device. The profile is only used to attribute sales and marketing effort to a Publisher, even if the end user has changed devices before completing a transaction.
Awin permits Publishers to enquire as to whether an action by a user ought to have generated a commission for that Publisher. This necessitates the sharing of information, between Publishers and Advertisers. Advertisers use the information provided by Publishers to verify against their own records. Awin enables this data sharing and the payment of any commission due to the Publisher as a result.
How do we collect data from end users?
The main technologies used for Awin’s tracking are Tracking Domain Cookies, Journey Tags and Device Fingerprinting.
Awin Tracking Domain Cookies
: These are cookies served by Awin’s own domain when an end user clicks on an advertisement displayed by a Publisher. We use this information to understand which end users are referred by which Publishers to which Advertiser. Please find some general information on cookies
here
. Our tracking cookies are listed
here
.
Advertiser Journey Tag
: This is JavaScript code integrated into the Advertiser’s service to enable Awin to receive transactional information from Advertisers. Awin uses this information to record, validate and report the completion of transactions, for the purposes of apportioning commissions to Publishers.
Fingerprinting
: This is a method by which Awin can uniquely identify a device by considering certain attributes of the browser or the device (incl. screen size/resolution and user configurations).
What data do we collect from end users?
We take care to collect only the data that we need. The majority of the data Awin uses is machine generated. It lets us single out a person but it does not reveal who that person is. We do not use this data to make predictions or evaluations of users’ interest or personalities.
Awin is one part of the affiliate marketing ecosystem (see our Agreement with Advertisers and Publishers below) and does not always have absolute control over the personal data that it receives from users, Publishers or Advertisers.
Awin participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. Awin’s identification number within the framework is: 907.
Awin stores an individual sequence of figures in respect of a transaction that does not reveal the name of a particular end user and contains information on the Advertiser’s campaign, the Publisher, the end user action (i.e. a click or a view and in which country it occurred), and the device that is used.
Awin also receives limited transactional information via the Journey Tag, to confirm that a transaction has occurred and carry out accurate commission allocating, billing and reporting. Such information includes the order value, whether a voucher has been used, product type, and sales channel.
Awin's data processing activities relating to end user data, do not require the direct identification of an individual and therefore Awin mostly holds what is known as “pseudonymous” data in this respect. Pseudonymisation is privacy-enhancing. It is the separation of data from direct identifiers so that data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional information. Pseudonymisation, therefore, reduces the risks associated with data processing, while also maintaining the data’s utility.
Does Awin have legitimate interest in using data?
We have carried out a balancing test and have identified legitimate interest as a basis for processing user data for the purposes set out in this section of the Privacy Policy.
When assessing Awin’s reliance on legitimate interest, the interests of the full affiliate ecosystem were considered. A balancing test was carried out and it was confirmed that tracking carries a low risk of undue negative impact on the end user’s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Legitimate interests are not limited to the interests of Awin, but can be legitimate interests of a third party or to society as a whole. In the context of our service, we consider that:
Advertisers have an interest in carrying on an online advertising campaign, paid for on a performance basis, whereby third party referrers of customers or potential customers of the Advertiser are compensated for referrals which generate revenue for the Advertiser or which undertake another act desired by the Advertiser.
Publishers have an interest in monetising their content, services or other aspects of the Publisher website by generating advertising revenue which is paid on a performance basis.
Advertisers and publishers have an interest in obtaining reports relevant to their respective business revenue generation.
Awin has an interest in operating an affiliate marketing platform, and to provide technology, services and reporting, in return for payment from Advertisers.
Awin, Advertisers, Publishers and society at large have an interest in preventing fraud, misuse of services, or money laundering.
What is our arrangement with Publishers and Advertisers on our network?
Awin's affiliate marketing network connects Advertisers and Publishers, as well as third-party technology partners in some instances, so that they can work together to run affiliate marketing campaigns.
In running the campaign each party plays their part in pursuing the common purposes and each party can make certain decisions about the way data is used.
Awin contractually requires that participation in its network is compliant with data protection law and that participants each fulfil their obligations to respond to requests to exercise data subject rights. You can approach each party, if you intend to exercise your rights in respect of the data which that party controls.
Awin works with these
Advertisers
. For guidance on how to make a request to a Publisher or an Advertiser, please check their respective privacy notices. For more information of how to make a request to Awin, “What rights do you have in respect of user data” below.
For how long do we keep end user data?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
As a general rule, Awin retains tracking data for 36 months after collection.
What rights do you have in respect of user data?
We will honour your rights under applicable data protection laws. These rights are not absolute and they do not always apply in all cases. If you wish to make a request in respect of your user data, as described in this section of the Privacy Policy, please contact
global-privacy@awin.com
You may:
request access to your personal data and information related to our use and processing of your personal data;
request the correction or deletion of your personal data;
request that we restrict our use of your personal data;
request a machine-readable copy of your personal data or that your personal data be transferred to other IT systems;
object to the processing of your personal data ; and
withdraw your consent to our use of your personal data at any time where we rely on your consent to use or process that personal data.
Please note that, as described under “What data do we collect from users?”, Awin mostly holds what is known as “pseudonymous” data in respect of users. Pseudonymisation means that we may not be in a position to identify the individual behind the data we hold and that we therefore cannot provide them with access, rectification, erasure or data portability without the provision of additional data (for example your IP address, or device ID).
How do we use data to administer our business?
We process personal data for the legitimate interests of ensuring that use of our services is lawful and non-fraudulent, does not disrupt the operation of our services, does not harass our staff or other individuals, and to enforce our legal rights and comply with our legal obligations.
Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any of the applicable laws, we may use your personal data to inform relevant third parties such as your email/internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content.
With whom do we share your personal data?
Partners on the Awin network:
Your personal data may be shared to the extent necessary for us to provide our services (i.e. to advertisers and publishers and/or third-party technology partners engaged by those parties).
Group members
, personnel, service providers: We keep your personal data confidential, but disclose it to our group members, our personnel, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. However, this is on the basis that they do not make independent use of the personal data, and have agreed to safeguard it. Activities which are carried out by third party service providers include: CRM management software (Pardot, MailChimp), website hosting, [website analytics] and IT support.
Merger or acquisition
: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email, account message and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding this personal data.
Required by law
: In addition, we disclose your personal data to the extent that we are required to do so by law (e.g. to government bodies and law enforcement agencies); in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings; and in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention).
Enforcement
: We disclose your personal data to third parties in order to enforce or apply the terms of agreements, to investigate potential breaches or to protect the rights, property or safety of Awin, our customers or others.
How do we keep your data safe?
We will take appropriate technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal data.
Please be aware that, although we endeavour to provide security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
Do we transfer data outside of the UK/EEA?
We are established in the
following countries
and in the course of business we may transfer personal data to other entities in our group in those countries. We also transmit your data to our subcontracted service providers, both in and out of the EU.
Where we transfer your personal data to entities in our group or service providers in countries which have not been deemed to have an adequate level of protection under an adequacy decision of the EU Commission, we have put in place specific contracts containing the EU Commission’s standard contractual clauses (the “SCCs”) to ensure that your personal data is treated by all parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects laws on data protection, in particular the GDPR.
