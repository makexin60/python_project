These apps collect no personal data of any kind. These apps are for aesthetic purposes only and I have zero incentive to collect any sort of data from any user nor do these apps require any user data to function.
My Apps that may collect data:
Reev Pro
Reev Dark
These apps are also for aesthetic purposes. They do not require any user data to function. The only data that is collected is user email address and list of apps installed on their device only on one specific condition as described below.
If a user excplicitly uses the
Request icons
feature within the app to `request` the
author
for more icons to be added into the app in future updates. This data is sent directly to
author's
request collection email which is then only used for the purposes of collecting app icons and their names for further icons development. User email addresses are dismissed after the request package that is included when user sends the 'request' (.zip file containing app icons that are requested by user, their launcher activity which is used for applying the correct icon to a specific app package and their names) is downloaded.
