2. Personal, Sensitive, and Non-Personal Data We Collect and How We Use and Disclose It
In connection with the Services, we collect data about you directly through the Services, automatically when you visit the Services, and sometimes from third parties. Some of this data may be considered “personal information” or “personal data,” and some may further be considered “sensitive”, under various applicable laws. We consider data that identifies you as a specific, identified individual (such as your name and email address) to be personal data. We will also treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” “or personal data” where required by applicable law.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal data so that it is non-personal, such as aggregating or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as “hash”. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified and pseudonymized data as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. If we combine non-personal data with personal data, then we will treat the combined information as personal data under this Privacy Policy. We may share non-personal data with third parties for any purpose in our discretion and as permitted by law, including for advertising, research and marketing purposes.

a. Data We Collect Automatically
Device ID/Information.
We, our service providers, business partners, and/or other third parties may automatically collect and/or store certain information when you visit or interact with the Services (“Device ID/Information”). This Device ID/Information may be stored and/or accessed from your computer, tablet, mobile phone, digital media player, or other device whenever you visit or interact with the Services. Device ID/Information may include, but is not limited to:
Your IP address, mobile device identifier and other unique identifier
Device information, including device model, operating system version, device date and time, mobile network information
MAC address, type and version of browser, browser identifier, type and version of operating system, type of platform, identity of carrier, radio type (such as 4G) , domain names, device identifiers, push notification tokens, and, for the Philo Subscription Service, advertising identifiers.
Approximate location of your device, which may be collected or inferred through other data we collect, such as IP address.
How you use and interact with the Services, including your search terms, pages you visit, content you view, preferences and settings (such as preferred language), ads you interact with, application installations, referring and exit pages and URLs.
Approximate Location Data.
We may collect or infer your approximate location through data we collect, such as IP address. In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with data regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Services.
Device ID/Information may be collected through the use of the following technologies:
Cookies, Local Storage, and Local Shared Objects
.
“Cookies” are small pieces of information downloaded to your device when you visit a website or other service and are stored by your browser. Cookies are then sent back to the originating service on each subsequent visit to that Service or to another website or service that recognizes those cookies. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Our cookies enable us to facilitate access to different aspects of our Services. For example, by showing when and how you and others visit our Services, cookies help us to see which pages of the Services are popular and which are not. Cookies can also help us improve your enjoyment of the Services, for example, by remembering your session ID and other personal data used to identify you as an authorized subscriber to the Services. We may create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences. We may use cookies to personalize ads for the Services and on other web properties. We may use session cookies during the time of your visit on the Services that may be deleted when you exit, depending on your browser, and we may also use more permanent cookies so we can recognize you if you return to the Services. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable, decline, or clear cookies and local storage; please check your browser’s settings for further information. You can find more information about cookies at
www.allaboutcookies.org
.
We may use local shared objects (LSOs) such as and local storage, such as HTML5 Local Storage, to enhance user experience. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage does nothing to or with the data stored on your device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Services or, in connection with the Services, to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity may also use HTML5 to collect and store information.
Web Beacons and Pixel Tags
.
We may also use web beacons and pixel tags (also known as web bugs and clear GIFs). Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are Internet tools, such as transparent images on the Services or in emails we may send you, that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page or ad on the Services has been viewed or an email opened. For example, when you ask us to send you information, we may use web beacons to determine how many emails we sent were actually opened. A pixel tag is a type of web beacon embedded in an image on the Services. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including a banner ad on the Services, may contain a pixel tag. We may use web beacons and pixel tags to help us optimize and tailor the Services. In connection with certain Services, we may also use web beacons and pixel tags to help us track conversions and optimize and tailor advertising for you and other future visitors to the website. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.
Embedded Scripts
.
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third-party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with the Services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.
Software Development Kits (SDKs)
.
These are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps. These tools can be used to create and operate features that collect information from your device.
Data Collection from Mobile Devices
.
We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in SDKs to collect information from mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website usage behavior. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.
Session Recording Language
.
Philo may record through session replay technology your interactions with the Services, such as what pages you visit on the Services, how long you visit those pages, and any links you click or information you provide. We use this information for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve the Services and our products and services, and to address functionality issues.
In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar device and device interaction information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.
b. Data We Receive or Collect from Third Parties
Enhancement Data.
We may receive data about you from third parties, such as data aggregators and other business partners. We may also supplement the data we collect with outside records from third parties, such as public databases, publicly available social media pages, and third parties who enhance the information we have about you, in order to provide you with information, services or products you have requested, to tailor content, to provide relevant advertising, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for other purposes. The data collected and stored by third parties is subject solely to the third party’s privacy practices.
c. Data you Provide Directly
We may ask you to provide data to use when you use the Services, for example, in the following ways:
Viewed Content and VPPA Compliance.
If you stop watching a program on a particular device, the Services give you the option to pick up the program where you left off when you launch the Services on a different device. To do this, we must keep track of the content you have watched, including series titles and episode names, when you watched the content, and the point at which you stopped watching the content. We make recordings of that content, and connect that information to your Account, along with identifying all devices you use with your Account. The Services also let you pause, rewind or fast-forward content. To do this, we must make recordings of the content you are watching and connect that information with your Account. The general categories of content you view may also be used to provide you with more relevant advertising. We may also collect information about ads you have viewed on certain Services.
You acknowledge that, if you choose to post any information about your viewing history on a third-party platform, or by liking or sharing any content, the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (18 U.S.C. § 2710) (or any similar state law) does not apply. However, to the extent it does apply in any manner, you are providing your informed, written consent to the disclosure of that information pursuant to the Video Privacy Protection Act.
Live Chat.
The Services can record, use, and retain your information provided, as well as the communications within the chat, for purposes of assisting you during the conversation, provide related support for your account, to improve our products and services, and for marketing purposes. If you do not consent, please do not continue with chat assistance. If you choose to permit screen or video sharing to assist with troubleshooting, we may be able to view any data, applications, or content displayed through your device camera or present on your device screen at that time.
Sweepstakes, Contests, & Promotions.
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions, or official rules that govern the Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you (including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials). If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal data may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, as required by law, or as permitted by the Promotion’s terms or official rules (such as on a winners list).
d. Disclosure of Data to Third Parties
Philo may share non-personal data, which may include Device ID/Interaction Information, data that has been hashed or otherwise de-identified or pseudonymized, with third parties in our discretion and as allowed by law, including for targeted advertising purposes. We may share the data we have collected about you as allowed by law, as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, and in the following circumstances:
Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.
Certain companies (collectively, “
Service
Companies
”) provide services to us, our business partners or, in the case of certain Services, our advertisers. Service Companies may use data for the same purposes we do under this Privacy Policy. For example, they may assist us with our business operations; the provision of the Services, including all associated features, functions, transactions and operations; marketing; analytics; data processing or data management; security; fraud prevention; legal services; auditing; Account management; hosting; customer or technical support; delivering you the features and functionality you have requested; other services; advertising; billing and processing payments; Account management; hosting; and measurement. These Service Companies include, without limitation, companies that send text messages or emails to you, support customer service, and companies that process payment card information, support our advertising programs, provide data storage, assist with audience research, and assist with product development. Depending on the services they provide, we may share information to Service Companies or allow those Service Companies to collect information about you. For example, Service Companies that assist us with emails and texts may receive your email address or mobile phone number and the content of the message we are sending, which may include a reminder you have requested for a particular television program; companies that assist us with customer service or support may receive information necessary to access your Account, information needed to resolve the issue, and any other information you provide; and payment processors may receive order information, payment information, IP addresses and other device identifiers to process payments; marketing and advertising Service Companies may receive non-precise location information, email addresses, phone numbers, other contact information, IP addresses, advertising identifiers, and your reactions, such as clicking on an ad or making a purchase; and measurement Service Companies may receive IP addresses, advertising identifiers, and other device identifiers. Service Companies may use the personal data we provide to them consistent with our agreements with them, and those terms may, for example, authorize them to use personal data to carry out the service they are providing for us, to analyze, manage, maintain, or improve their services, to combat fraud, financial loss, and abuse, as required by law, to share personal data with their service companies, and , where permitted by law, to improve ad targeting. Additionally, we may share various information relating to our users and fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activities with our fraud prevention and similar service providers, and they will use this information to help us and their other clients prevent fraudulent and illegal transactions
Affiliated Media Content Providers.
If you use the Services to sign on to applications offered by affiliated media content providers (for example, “TV Everywhere” applications), we may share your information with them to certify to them that you may use those applications.

If, in connection with a business transaction your personal data will be processed in a materially different way, material changes will be posted on the Philo website or the Services. If you have an Account and provided your email address, we may also provide you with email notification of such material changes. By providing your information, you understand and agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent.
Digital Fingerprinting and Cross-Device Linking.
Besides the data collection and sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, some third parties may use certain technological measures and third party databases and services to engage in digital fingerprinting and cross-device linking. These technologies may passively collect information about your device to develop a digital identifier for your device, which is then stored on your device to identify the device in various online transactions. This information is combined with other information regarding your use of the Services and third party databases and may be combined with information from your Account, including personal data such as email addresses and phone numbers. The data collected by third parties may be maintained to create a history and reputation of a particular device, and may be used to connect to information on other devices you have used, to help reduce online fraud and recognize your devices in connection with the Services, analytics and personalized advertising on and within certain Services and other websites or applications you visit. To learn more about your choices to opt-out of third party advertising and analytics, please see

5. Third-Party Advertising and Analytics/Privacy Controls
We work with a variety of third party business partners (such as advertisers, ad networks, advertising servers, data exchanges, traffic measurement providers, marketing analytics providers, anti-fraud vendors, ad verification vendors, ad agencies and other providers who provide services related to advertising (“Ad Partners”) to deliver ads to you on certain Services and elsewhere online, to provide services related to advertising, and to provide services to help us market and advertise certain Services on other services. These Ad Partners may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons), and they may otherwise collect or have access to Device ID/Interaction Information and other data about you, some of which may be personal data under various state laws. You may submit data requested by interactive ads placed on certain Services or on third-party platforms. We may share this information with our Ad Partners. The Ad Partners may use various technologies to identify your non-precise location, such as city or zip code. We and our Ad Partners and their service companies may collect information about your movement within and usage of applications using one or more advertising identifiers, which is a randomly generated alphanumeric code associated with your device, to support or deliver personalized advertising. These user-resettable identifiers have different names depending on the operating system – Google Advertising ID (GAID) on Android devices and Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA) on iOS on Apple devices. Ad Partners and their service companies may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect information from or about you through the Services. These collection technologies on the Services, in your browser and within our applications may be used to (among other purposes) collect data about you when you visit the Services (such as content viewed or ads viewed or clicked on), where you go, what you do (such as making a purchase), how you use the Services, and where you go after you leave that Service, and your other activities online and may include the information described in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy (“Personal, Sensitive, and Non-Personal Data We Collect and How We Use and Disclose It ”), including without limitation, your email address and phone number. The Ad Partners may use the information on the Services and on other websites and applications you visit for purposes that include, without limitation, the following activities: to advertise to you on the Philo Services and elsewhere online based on your activities on our Services; measure ad performance and report the efficacy and performance of ad campaigns; improve advertising effectiveness, including to determine when an ad is viewable to a consumer; track conversions; generate and match audience segments for the purposes of targeting ads; limit the frequency with which you see certain ads; generate campaign insights to better understand the impact of an ad campaign or its effect on the types of audience to which it was served; link your devices, enable other enhancements, provide reporting, detect actual or potential ad fraud, conduct benchmarking, facilitate safety and security, conduct research and development, enable the Ad Partners to deliver more relevant targeted ads on and within the Services and elsewhere online, including negative targeting” (i.e., designate you as among a group of consumers not to be targeted with certain ads); comply with law, and provide the information to other Ad Partners. Besides the other uses described in this section, our Ad Partners may use your non-precise location to provide ads, offers and notices relevant to your geographic location.
We may provide log files to Ad Partners for the purposes described in this section). The log files cover activity on the Services over a period of time by all viewers of the ad and may include, without limitation, information related to the ad, times of interaction, information about your device, identifiers for you and your device, and cookie information that can be linked to your activity on other services and on other devices. We may also compile and provide reports, including in encrypted, aggregated, or de-identified forms, to Ad Partners about the effectiveness of their campaigns.

14.1 California Privacy Notice
This California Privacy Notice is updated and effective as of July 1, 2024.

This notice sets forth the disclosures and certain additional rights for California Consumers regarding their personal information, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), described below. This notice supplements the information in this Privacy Policy and applies only to California residents. All capitalized terms in this Section 14.1 that are not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy shall be defined as set forth in the CCPA, CPRA, and the associated regulations of the Attorney General, unless otherwise defined.

Philo’s California Privacy Notice – Employees, Applicants, Owners, Directors, Officers and Contractors
.
14.1.2 Data Rights
California Consumers have the right to request: (1) that we disclose to you what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell/share, including the right to request that we provide to you the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you (“
Right to Know
”) (2) that we delete the personal information we have collected from you (“
Right to Delete
”); and, (3) that we correct inaccurate personal information we hold about you (
“Right to Correct
”), (4) to opt out from the sharing of your personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e. targeted advertising) (“
Right to Opt-Out of Sharing
”), and (5) to opt-out from the sale of personal information (“
Right to Opt-Out of Sale
”), all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA and CPRA. More information on each of these rights is below.
14.1.2.1 Right to Know
California Consumers may request that we disclose the following information:
The categories of personal information we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or “selling” or “sharing” your personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we have Collected about you.
The categories of personal information we have “sold” or “shared” or disclosed about you for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom your personal information was “sold” or “shared” disclosed for a business purpose.
In order to have us provide you with specific pieces of information, we may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
14.1.2.2 Right to Delete
California Consumers may request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you (and direct our Service Providers to do the same).

14.1.2.3 Right to Correct Inaccurate Information
California Consumers have the right to request that we correct inaccurate information we hold about you.
14.1.2.4 Right to Limit The Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information

The opt out in this Section will apply to “sales” or “sharing” that occurs after the opt-out has been processed by us within the time limit required under California law.

In connection with the Services, we collect data about you directly through the Services, automatically when you visit the Services, and sometimes from third parties. Some of this data may be considered “personal information” or “personal data,” and some may further be considered “sensitive”, under various applicable laws. We consider data that identifies you as a specific, identified individual (such as your name and email address) to be personal data. We will also treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” “or personal data” where required by applicable law.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal data so that it is non-personal, such as aggregating or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as “hash”. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified and pseudonymized data as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.

a. Data We Collect Automatically
Device ID/Information.
We, our service providers, business partners, and/or other third parties may automatically collect and/or store certain information when you visit or interact with the Services (“Device ID/Information”). This Device ID/Information may be stored and/or accessed from your computer, tablet, mobile phone, digital media player, or other device whenever you visit or interact with the Services. Device ID/Information may include, but is not limited to:
Your IP address, mobile device identifier and other unique identifier
Device information, including device model, operating system version, device date and time, mobile network information
MAC address, type and version of browser, browser identifier, type and version of operating system, type of platform, identity of carrier, radio type (such as 4G) , domain names, device identifiers, push notification tokens, and, for the Philo Subscription Service, advertising identifiers.
Approximate location of your device, which may be collected or inferred through other data we collect, such as IP address.
How you use and interact with the Services, including your search terms, pages you visit, content you view, preferences and settings (such as preferred language), ads you interact with, application installations, referring and exit pages and URLs.
Approximate Location Data.
We may collect or infer your approximate location through data we collect, such as IP address. In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with data regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Services.
Device ID/Information may be collected through the use of the following technologies:
Cookies, Local Storage, and Local Shared Objects
.
“Cookies” are small pieces of information downloaded to your device when you visit a website or other service and are stored by your browser. Cookies are then sent back to the originating service on each subsequent visit to that Service or to another website or service that recognizes those cookies. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Our cookies enable us to facilitate access to different aspects of our Services. For example, by showing when and how you and others visit our Services, cookies help us to see which pages of the Services are popular and which are not. Cookies can also help us improve your enjoyment of the Services, for example, by remembering your session ID and other personal data used to identify you as an authorized subscriber to the Services. We may create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences. We may use cookies to personalize ads for the Services and on other web properties. We may use session cookies during the time of your visit on the Services that may be deleted when you exit, depending on your browser, and we may also use more permanent cookies so we can recognize you if you return to the Services. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable, decline, or clear cookies and local storage; please check your browser’s settings for further information. You can find more information about cookies at
www.allaboutcookies.org
.
We may use local shared objects (LSOs) such as and local storage, such as HTML5 Local Storage, to enhance user experience. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage does nothing to or with the data stored on your device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Services or, in connection with the Services, to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity may also use HTML5 to collect and store information.
Web Beacons and Pixel Tags
.
We may also use web beacons and pixel tags (also known as web bugs and clear GIFs). Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are Internet tools, such as transparent images on the Services or in emails we may send you, that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page or ad on the Services has been viewed or an email opened. For example, when you ask us to send you information, we may use web beacons to determine how many emails we sent were actually opened. A pixel tag is a type of web beacon embedded in an image on the Services. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including a banner ad on the Services, may contain a pixel tag. We may use web beacons and pixel tags to help us optimize and tailor the Services. In connection with certain Services, we may also use web beacons and pixel tags to help us track conversions and optimize and tailor advertising for you and other future visitors to the website. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.
Embedded Scripts
.
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third-party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with the Services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.
Software Development Kits (SDKs)
.
These are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps. These tools can be used to create and operate features that collect information from your device.
Data Collection from Mobile Devices
.
We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in SDKs to collect information from mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website usage behavior. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.
Session Recording Language
.
Philo may record through session replay technology your interactions with the Services, such as what pages you visit on the Services, how long you visit those pages, and any links you click or information you provide. We use this information for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve the Services and our products and services, and to address functionality issues.
In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar device and device interaction information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.
b. Data We Receive or Collect from Third Parties
Enhancement Data.
We may receive data about you from third parties, such as data aggregators and other business partners. We may also supplement the data we collect with outside records from third parties, such as public databases, publicly available social media pages, and third parties who enhance the information we have about you, in order to provide you with information, services or products you have requested, to tailor content, to provide relevant advertising, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for other purposes. The data collected and stored by third parties is subject solely to the third party’s privacy practices.
c. Data you Provide Directly
We may ask you to provide data to use when you use the Services, for example, in the following ways:
Viewed Content and VPPA Compliance.
If you stop watching a program on a particular device, the Services give you the option to pick up the program where you left off when you launch the Services on a different device. To do this, we must keep track of the content you have watched, including series titles and episode names, when you watched the content, and the point at which you stopped watching the content. We make recordings of that content, and connect that information to your Account, along with identifying all devices you use with your Account. The Services also let you pause, rewind or fast-forward content. To do this, we must make recordings of the content you are watching and connect that information with your Account. The general categories of content you view may also be used to provide you with more relevant advertising. We may also collect information about ads you have viewed on certain Services.
You acknowledge that, if you choose to post any information about your viewing history on a third-party platform, or by liking or sharing any content, the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (18 U.S.C. § 2710) (or any similar state law) does not apply. However, to the extent it does apply in any manner, you are providing your informed, written consent to the disclosure of that information pursuant to the Video Privacy Protection Act.
Live Chat.
The Services can record, use, and retain your information provided, as well as the communications within the chat, for purposes of assisting you during the conversation, provide related support for your account, to improve our products and services, and for marketing purposes. If you do not consent, please do not continue with chat assistance. If you choose to permit screen or video sharing to assist with troubleshooting, we may be able to view any data, applications, or content displayed through your device camera or present on your device screen at that time.
Sweepstakes, Contests, & Promotions.
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions, or official rules that govern the Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you (including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials). If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal data may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, as required by law, or as permitted by the Promotion’s terms or official rules (such as on a winners list).
d. Disclosure of Data to Third Parties
Philo may share non-personal data, which may include Device ID/Interaction Information, data that has been hashed or otherwise de-identified or pseudonymized, with third parties in our discretion and as allowed by law, including for targeted advertising purposes.

Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.
Certain companies (collectively, “
Service
Companies
”) provide services to us, our business partners or, in the case of certain Services, our advertisers. Service Companies may use data for the same purposes we do under this Privacy Policy. For example, they may assist us with our business operations; the provision of the Services, including all associated features, functions, transactions and operations; marketing; analytics; data processing or data management; security; fraud prevention; legal services; auditing; Account management; hosting; customer or technical support; delivering you the features and functionality you have requested; other services; advertising; billing and processing payments; Account management; hosting; and measurement. These Service Companies include, without limitation, companies that send text messages or emails to you, support customer service, and companies that process payment card information, support our advertising programs, provide data storage, assist with audience research, and assist with product development. Depending on the services they provide, we may share information to Service Companies or allow those Service Companies to collect information about you. For example, Service Companies that assist us with emails and texts may receive your email address or mobile phone number and the content of the message we are sending, which may include a reminder you have requested for a particular television program; companies that assist us with customer service or support may receive information necessary to access your Account, information needed to resolve the issue, and any other information you provide; and payment processors may receive order information, payment information, IP addresses and other device identifiers to process payments; marketing and advertising Service Companies may receive non-precise location information, email addresses, phone numbers, other contact information, IP addresses, advertising identifiers, and your reactions, such as clicking on an ad or making a purchase; and measurement Service Companies may receive IP addresses, advertising identifiers, and other device identifiers. Service Companies may use the personal data we provide to them consistent with our agreements with them, and those terms may, for example, authorize them to use personal data to carry out the service they are providing for us, to analyze, manage, maintain, or improve their services, to combat fraud, financial loss, and abuse, as required by law, to share personal data with their service companies, and , where permitted by law, to improve ad targeting. Additionally, we may share various information relating to our users and fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activities with our fraud prevention and similar service providers, and they will use this information to help us and their other clients prevent fraudulent and illegal transactions
Affiliated Media Content Providers.
If you use the Services to sign on to applications offered by affiliated media content providers (for example, “TV Everywhere” applications), we may share your information with them to certify to them that you may use those applications.

By accessing, logging into, or connecting with certain Services using Account information from a social media network or other third-party platform, you agree that we may transmit your user information to the provider of the social media network or other third-party platform.
Business Transactions and Transfers.
If Philo sells all or part of its business or is otherwise involved in a reorganization, dissolution, merger, transfer of all or a material part of its business or other similar event, personal data and non-personal data will likely be disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction and as part of pre-transaction due diligence. If, in connection with a business transaction your personal data will be processed in a materially different way, material changes will be posted on the Philo website or the Services. If you have an Account and provided your email address, we may also provide you with email notification of such material changes. By providing your information, you understand and agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent.
Digital Fingerprinting and Cross-Device Linking.
Besides the data collection and sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, some third parties may use certain technological measures and third party databases and services to engage in digital fingerprinting and cross-device linking. These technologies may passively collect information about your device to develop a digital identifier for your device, which is then stored on your device to identify the device in various online transactions. This information is combined with other information regarding your use of the Services and third party databases and may be combined with information from your Account, including personal data such as email addresses and phone numbers. The data collected by third parties may be maintained to create a history and reputation of a particular device, and may be used to connect to information on other devices you have used, to help reduce online fraud and recognize your devices in connection with the Services, analytics and personalized advertising on and within certain Services and other websites or applications you visit. To learn more about your choices to opt-out of third party advertising and analytics, please see
Section 5
of this Privacy Policy.
5. Third-Party Advertising and Analytics/Privacy Controls
We work with a variety of third party business partners (such as advertisers, ad networks, advertising servers, data exchanges, traffic measurement providers, marketing analytics providers, anti-fraud vendors, ad verification vendors, ad agencies and other providers who provide services related to advertising (“Ad Partners”) to deliver ads to you on certain Services and elsewhere online, to provide services related to advertising, and to provide services to help us market and advertise certain Services on other services. These Ad Partners may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons), and they may otherwise collect or have access to Device ID/Interaction Information and other data about you, some of which may be personal data under various state laws. You may submit data requested by interactive ads placed on certain Services or on third-party platforms. We may share this information with our Ad Partners. The Ad Partners may use various technologies to identify your non-precise location, such as city or zip code. We and our Ad Partners and their service companies may collect information about your movement within and usage of applications using one or more advertising identifiers, which is a randomly generated alphanumeric code associated with your device, to support or deliver personalized advertising. These user-resettable identifiers have different names depending on the operating system – Google Advertising ID (GAID) on Android devices and Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA) on iOS on Apple devices. Ad Partners and their service companies may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect information from or about you through the Services. These collection technologies on the Services, in your browser and within our applications may be used to (among other purposes) collect data about you when you visit the Services (such as content viewed or ads viewed or clicked on), where you go, what you do (such as making a purchase), how you use the Services, and where you go after you leave that Service, and your other activities online and may include the information described in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy (“Personal, Sensitive, and Non-Personal Data We Collect and How We Use and Disclose It ”), including without limitation, your email address and phone number. The Ad Partners may use the information on the Services and on other websites and applications you visit for purposes that include, without limitation, the following activities: to advertise to you on the Philo Services and elsewhere online based on your activities on our Services; measure ad performance and report the efficacy and performance of ad campaigns; improve advertising effectiveness, including to determine when an ad is viewable to a consumer; track conversions; generate and match audience segments for the purposes of targeting ads; limit the frequency with which you see certain ads; generate campaign insights to better understand the impact of an ad campaign or its effect on the types of audience to which it was served; link your devices, enable other enhancements, provide reporting, detect actual or potential ad fraud, conduct benchmarking, facilitate safety and security, conduct research and development, enable the Ad Partners to deliver more relevant targeted ads on and within the Services and elsewhere online, including negative targeting” (i.e., designate you as among a group of consumers not to be targeted with certain ads); comply with law, and provide the information to other Ad Partners. Besides the other uses described in this section, our Ad Partners may use your non-precise location to provide ads, offers and notices relevant to your geographic location.
We may provide log files to Ad Partners for the purposes described in this section). The log files cover activity on the Services over a period of time by all viewers of the ad and may include, without limitation, information related to the ad, times of interaction, information about your device, identifiers for you and your device, and cookie information that can be linked to your activity on other services and on other devices. We may also compile and provide reports, including in encrypted, aggregated, or de-identified forms, to Ad Partners about the effectiveness of their campaigns.

14.1.2 Data Rights
California Consumers have the right to request: (1) that we disclose to you what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell/share, including the right to request that we provide to you the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you (“
Right to Know
”) (2) that we delete the personal information we have collected from you (“
Right to Delete
”); and, (3) that we correct inaccurate personal information we hold about you (
“Right to Correct
”), (4) to opt out from the sharing of your personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e. targeted advertising) (“
Right to Opt-Out of Sharing
”), and (5) to opt-out from the sale of personal information (“
Right to Opt-Out of Sale
”), all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA and CPRA. More information on each of these rights is below.
14.1.2.1 Right to Know
California Consumers may request that we disclose the following information:
The categories of personal information we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or “selling” or “sharing” your personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we have Collected about you.
The categories of personal information we have “sold” or “shared” or disclosed about you for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom your personal information was “sold” or “shared” disclosed for a business purpose.
In order to have us provide you with specific pieces of information, we may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
14.1.2.2 Right to Delete

2. Personal, Sensitive, and Non-Personal Data We Collect and How We Use and Disclose It
In connection with the Services, we collect data about you directly through the Services, automatically when you visit the Services, and sometimes from third parties. Some of this data may be considered “personal information” or “personal data,” and some may further be considered “sensitive”, under various applicable laws. We consider data that identifies you as a specific, identified individual (such as your name and email address) to be personal data. We will also treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” “or personal data” where required by applicable law.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal data so that it is non-personal, such as aggregating or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as “hash”. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified and pseudonymized data as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. If we combine non-personal data with personal data, then we will treat the combined information as personal data under this Privacy Policy. We may share non-personal data with third parties for any purpose in our discretion and as permitted by law, including for advertising, research and marketing purposes.

We provide in this section additional detail about the information practices listed in the Chart of key data practices linked in Section 3 above, where it would be helpful for your understanding of such practices.
a. Data We Collect Automatically
Device ID/Information.
We, our service providers, business partners, and/or other third parties may automatically collect and/or store certain information when you visit or interact with the Services (“Device ID/Information”). This Device ID/Information may be stored and/or accessed from your computer, tablet, mobile phone, digital media player, or other device whenever you visit or interact with the Services. Device ID/Information may include, but is not limited to:
Your IP address, mobile device identifier and other unique identifier
Device information, including device model, operating system version, device date and time, mobile network information
MAC address, type and version of browser, browser identifier, type and version of operating system, type of platform, identity of carrier, radio type (such as 4G) , domain names, device identifiers, push notification tokens, and, for the Philo Subscription Service, advertising identifiers.
Approximate location of your device, which may be collected or inferred through other data we collect, such as IP address.
How you use and interact with the Services, including your search terms, pages you visit, content you view, preferences and settings (such as preferred language), ads you interact with, application installations, referring and exit pages and URLs.
Approximate Location Data.
We may collect or infer your approximate location through data we collect, such as IP address. In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with data regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Services.
Device ID/Information may be collected through the use of the following technologies:
Cookies, Local Storage, and Local Shared Objects
.
“Cookies” are small pieces of information downloaded to your device when you visit a website or other service and are stored by your browser. Cookies are then sent back to the originating service on each subsequent visit to that Service or to another website or service that recognizes those cookies. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Our cookies enable us to facilitate access to different aspects of our Services. For example, by showing when and how you and others visit our Services, cookies help us to see which pages of the Services are popular and which are not. Cookies can also help us improve your enjoyment of the Services, for example, by remembering your session ID and other personal data used to identify you as an authorized subscriber to the Services. We may create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences. We may use cookies to personalize ads for the Services and on other web properties. We may use session cookies during the time of your visit on the Services that may be deleted when you exit, depending on your browser, and we may also use more permanent cookies so we can recognize you if you return to the Services. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable, decline, or clear cookies and local storage; please check your browser’s settings for further information. You can find more information about cookies at
www.allaboutcookies.org
.
We may use local shared objects (LSOs) such as and local storage, such as HTML5 Local Storage, to enhance user experience. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage does nothing to or with the data stored on your device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Services or, in connection with the Services, to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity may also use HTML5 to collect and store information.
Web Beacons and Pixel Tags
.
We may also use web beacons and pixel tags (also known as web bugs and clear GIFs). Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are Internet tools, such as transparent images on the Services or in emails we may send you, that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page or ad on the Services has been viewed or an email opened. For example, when you ask us to send you information, we may use web beacons to determine how many emails we sent were actually opened. A pixel tag is a type of web beacon embedded in an image on the Services. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including a banner ad on the Services, may contain a pixel tag. We may use web beacons and pixel tags to help us optimize and tailor the Services. In connection with certain Services, we may also use web beacons and pixel tags to help us track conversions and optimize and tailor advertising for you and other future visitors to the website. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.
Embedded Scripts
.
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third-party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with the Services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.
Software Development Kits (SDKs)
.
These are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps. These tools can be used to create and operate features that collect information from your device.
Data Collection from Mobile Devices
.
We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in SDKs to collect information from mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website usage behavior. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.
Session Recording Language
.
Philo may record through session replay technology your interactions with the Services, such as what pages you visit on the Services, how long you visit those pages, and any links you click or information you provide. We use this information for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve the Services and our products and services, and to address functionality issues.
In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar device and device interaction information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.
b. Data We Receive or Collect from Third Parties
Enhancement Data.
We may receive data about you from third parties, such as data aggregators and other business partners. We may also supplement the data we collect with outside records from third parties, such as public databases, publicly available social media pages, and third parties who enhance the information we have about you, in order to provide you with information, services or products you have requested, to tailor content, to provide relevant advertising, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for other purposes. The data collected and stored by third parties is subject solely to the third party’s privacy practices.
c. Data you Provide Directly
We may ask you to provide data to use when you use the Services, for example, in the following ways:
Viewed Content and VPPA Compliance.
If you stop watching a program on a particular device, the Services give you the option to pick up the program where you left off when you launch the Services on a different device. To do this, we must keep track of the content you have watched, including series titles and episode names, when you watched the content, and the point at which you stopped watching the content. We make recordings of that content, and connect that information to your Account, along with identifying all devices you use with your Account. The Services also let you pause, rewind or fast-forward content. To do this, we must make recordings of the content you are watching and connect that information with your Account. The general categories of content you view may also be used to provide you with more relevant advertising. We may also collect information about ads you have viewed on certain Services.
You acknowledge that, if you choose to post any information about your viewing history on a third-party platform, or by liking or sharing any content, the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (18 U.S.C. § 2710) (or any similar state law) does not apply. However, to the extent it does apply in any manner, you are providing your informed, written consent to the disclosure of that information pursuant to the Video Privacy Protection Act.
Live Chat.
The Services can record, use, and retain your information provided, as well as the communications within the chat, for purposes of assisting you during the conversation, provide related support for your account, to improve our products and services, and for marketing purposes. If you do not consent, please do not continue with chat assistance. If you choose to permit screen or video sharing to assist with troubleshooting, we may be able to view any data, applications, or content displayed through your device camera or present on your device screen at that time.
Sweepstakes, Contests, & Promotions.
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions, or official rules that govern the Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you (including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials). If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal data may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, as required by law, or as permitted by the Promotion’s terms or official rules (such as on a winners list).
d. Disclosure of Data to Third Parties
Philo may share non-personal data, which may include Device ID/Interaction Information, data that has been hashed or otherwise de-identified or pseudonymized, with third parties in our discretion and as allowed by law, including for targeted advertising purposes. We may share the data we have collected about you as allowed by law, as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, and in the following circumstances:
Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.
Certain companies (collectively, “
Service
Companies
”) provide services to us, our business partners or, in the case of certain Services, our advertisers. Service Companies may use data for the same purposes we do under this Privacy Policy. For example, they may assist us with our business operations; the provision of the Services, including all associated features, functions, transactions and operations; marketing; analytics; data processing or data management; security; fraud prevention; legal services; auditing; Account management; hosting; customer or technical support; delivering you the features and functionality you have requested; other services; advertising; billing and processing payments; Account management; hosting; and measurement. These Service Companies include, without limitation, companies that send text messages or emails to you, support customer service, and companies that process payment card information, support our advertising programs, provide data storage, assist with audience research, and assist with product development. Depending on the services they provide, we may share information to Service Companies or allow those Service Companies to collect information about you. For example, Service Companies that assist us with emails and texts may receive your email address or mobile phone number and the content of the message we are sending, which may include a reminder you have requested for a particular television program; companies that assist us with customer service or support may receive information necessary to access your Account, information needed to resolve the issue, and any other information you provide; and payment processors may receive order information, payment information, IP addresses and other device identifiers to process payments; marketing and advertising Service Companies may receive non-precise location information, email addresses, phone numbers, other contact information, IP addresses, advertising identifiers, and your reactions, such as clicking on an ad or making a purchase; and measurement Service Companies may receive IP addresses, advertising identifiers, and other device identifiers. Service Companies may use the personal data we provide to them consistent with our agreements with them, and those terms may, for example, authorize them to use personal data to carry out the service they are providing for us, to analyze, manage, maintain, or improve their services, to combat fraud, financial loss, and abuse, as required by law, to share personal data with their service companies, and , where permitted by law, to improve ad targeting. Additionally, we may share various information relating to our users and fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activities with our fraud prevention and similar service providers, and they will use this information to help us and their other clients prevent fraudulent and illegal transactions
Affiliated Media Content Providers.
If you use the Services to sign on to applications offered by affiliated media content providers (for example, “TV Everywhere” applications), we may share your information with them to certify to them that you may use those applications. We may also provide relevant information to them under this Privacy Policy. Your use of such applications is optional and is subject to separate terms of use and privacy policy(ies) provided by the media content provider.

Social Media and Other Third-Party Platforms in Connection with Services.
By accessing, logging into, or connecting with certain Services using Account information from a social media network or other third-party platform, you agree that we may transmit your user information to the provider of the social media network or other third-party platform.
Business Transactions and Transfers.
If Philo sells all or part of its business or is otherwise involved in a reorganization, dissolution, merger, transfer of all or a material part of its business or other similar event, personal data and non-personal data will likely be disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction and as part of pre-transaction due diligence. If, in connection with a business transaction your personal data will be processed in a materially different way, material changes will be posted on the Philo website or the Services. If you have an Account and provided your email address, we may also provide you with email notification of such material changes. By providing your information, you understand and agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent.
Digital Fingerprinting and Cross-Device Linking.
Besides the data collection and sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, some third parties may use certain technological measures and third party databases and services to engage in digital fingerprinting and cross-device linking. These technologies may passively collect information about your device to develop a digital identifier for your device, which is then stored on your device to identify the device in various online transactions. This information is combined with other information regarding your use of the Services and third party databases and may be combined with information from your Account, including personal data such as email addresses and phone numbers. The data collected by third parties may be maintained to create a history and reputation of a particular device, and may be used to connect to information on other devices you have used, to help reduce online fraud and recognize your devices in connection with the Services, analytics and personalized advertising on and within certain Services and other websites or applications you visit. To learn more about your choices to opt-out of third party advertising and analytics, please see
Section 5
of this Privacy Policy.
5. Third-Party Advertising and Analytics/Privacy Controls
We work with a variety of third party business partners (such as advertisers, ad networks, advertising servers, data exchanges, traffic measurement providers, marketing analytics providers, anti-fraud vendors, ad verification vendors, ad agencies and other providers who provide services related to advertising (“Ad Partners”) to deliver ads to you on certain Services and elsewhere online, to provide services related to advertising, and to provide services to help us market and advertise certain Services on other services. These Ad Partners may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons), and they may otherwise collect or have access to Device ID/Interaction Information and other data about you, some of which may be personal data under various state laws. You may submit data requested by interactive ads placed on certain Services or on third-party platforms. We may share this information with our Ad Partners. The Ad Partners may use various technologies to identify your non-precise location, such as city or zip code. We and our Ad Partners and their service companies may collect information about your movement within and usage of applications using one or more advertising identifiers, which is a randomly generated alphanumeric code associated with your device, to support or deliver personalized advertising.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

Overview
The Trade Desk offers what is known in the industry as a Demand Side Platform (“DSP” or “Platform”). We provide technology that helps advertisers and their advertising agencies manage digital advertising campaigns across many channels, such as websites, apps, audio, smart TVs, and other video. The advertising campaigns run by our clients help pay for the content you enjoy.
We, and our clients, collect and use data both to help ensure that the ads you see are relevant and to measure and report on their effectiveness.
Our Platform uses data to produce a mapping of devices that might be related to each other, meaning that they might be used by the same person or by people within the same household. This helps advertisers better target and measure their campaigns, as well as limiting the number of times the same person or household sees an ad.
Our references to our Platform in this policy only refer to the Trade Desk’s own advertising technology platform and do not include the technology or systems of clients or partners that use or integrate with us. Clients and partners are bound by our policies when they use our Platform.
The Trade Desk is a member in good standing of the
Network Advertising Initiative
(NAI). The Trade Desk also follows the industry self-regulatory guidelines of the
Digital Advertising Alliance
, the
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
, and the
European Digital Advertising Alliance
.
The Trade Desk also implements and adheres to the specifications and policies of the IAB EU Transparency & Consent Framework as part of our compliance with EU data protection law. The Trade Desk’s identification number within the Framework is 21. See

if we think it is required by law
In addition, much of the data collected on the Platform belongs to our clients and partners.

We maintain generally accepted security methods to protect data on the Platform.
We retain pseudonymous data up to 18 months before we aggregate it or remove pseudonymous identifers.
Your rights and choices:
You have rights and choices with respect to the personal data on the Platform. More detailed information is available below.
Full Privacy Policy
Below, we explain in detail the type of data we collect, how we collect it, how we use it, and how we disclose it, as well as the choices available to you. If, after reading this policy, you still have questions, please feel free to contact us.
THE PLATFORM
The Platform allows advertisers and advertising agencies to manage digital advertising campaigns. We operate as a Demand Side Platform; this means we represent the demand side of the digital advertising marketplace, in which advertisers and agencies with ads to display are the “demand” and publishers with space for such ads on web pages, apps, smart TVs and other digital properties are the “supply”.
Digital advertising uses identifiers and associated data to make ads more effective and to measure their effectiveness. Without identifiers, our advertiser clients wouldn’t know, for example, if a 100 ad views were the result of 100 different users that each saw an ad, or if one user saw the same ad 100 times. This information is crucial to advertisers. Without information like this, advertisers would pay publishers much less, forcing publishers to either show more ads or make users pay for their content.
Advertisers and their agencies collect and use data on the Platform in different ways. They may bring their own data to the Platform, collect data using the Platform, or remove their data from the Platform.
THE DATA THE PLATFORM COLLECTS AND PROCESSES
The Platform collects and processes pseudonymous data about users, households, devices, and ads and where they’re shown. This includes:
unique cookie identifiers
device advertising identifiers
Pseudonymous identifiers derived from email address or phone numbers, or device and connection information
IP addresses
Interest and demographic information stored and/​or used on the Platform by clients and partners
Interest and demographic information we create or infer
other information about browsers and devices, such as type, version and settings
location information based on IP address or other types of information that may include precise geolocation information (i.e., latitude/​longitude coordinates), if provided to us
information about ads that are shown, such as which ads are shown to a device or user, where (which web page or app) they are shown, and at what time
hashed email addresses and other identifying information (or information derived from such)
HOW THE PLATFORM COLLECTS DATA
The Platform receives data in several ways, including the following:
Advertisers and agencies may bring or collect their own information to our Platform (for example, that they collect on their own websites through the use of Platform technology) that we then store and use on their behalf to enhance their advertising campaigns.
Bid requests, which are sets of information that describe an ad space that is available to be filled. We get these requests from the “supply” side of the advertising ecosystem, meaning websites, apps, smart TVs, and others, as well as their agents. The requests contain information about the ad space, the device, and sometimes the user, including location information. They also usually have an ID (or IDs) that enables us to match the request with information we may already have.
Third-party suppliers of information used to target, optimize or measure advertising campaigns.
Purveyors of connected TV devices and apps can send us information about the video content viewed on the device or app.
Pixels and cookies, which allow us to recognize web browsers across sites and over time, and therefore to record information about them over time.
Mobile device IDs, which are made available through the device operating systems, like Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, for purposes of allowing mobile apps and their advertising partners to recognize a device over time. We use these IDs in a similar way to the way we use cookies.
Mobile SDKs are bits of code that some of our partners enable to be placed in mobile apps. This enables our partners to send us data about the mobile app and device in association with the mobile device ID.
After an ad serves, our servers receive a network request from the device on which the ad was shown in order to confirm that the ad was delivered and provide information for us to measure the ad.
COOKIES
Cookies help us by enabling our ability to distinguish between, recognize, and store data about unique web browsers and devices, and to store data on our servers for the advertising purposes described here. Our cookie domain is adsrvr​.org. The Trade Desk ID (TDID) is used to recognize web-browser profiles over time across sites. The TDID has a lifespan of 1 year from the time you last received an ad powered by Platform. This lifespan may be updated each time your browser encounters our Platform.
In order to be able to transmit requests for ads and other data about users or devices between sellers and buyers, and to help show you ads that match your likely interests, we engage in cookie syncing, meaning that we match our TDID to clients’ and partners’ cookie IDs. We also use a cookie to store a related opt-out choice, when users opt out of cookie based targeted advertising.
THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE PLATFORM PROCESSES DATA
The Platform processes data both on our own behalf and on behalf of clients and partners for purposes related to targeting, delivering, measuring and reporting on advertising.
Personalizing ads: We use data to increase advertising relevancy and effectiveness.
Ad delivery: We use data to enable the technical delivery of an ad and measure success of delivery.
Frequency and other reporting: We use a pseudonymous identifier to keep track of how many times an ad was shown, as well as where and when.
Measurement and analytics: We use an identifier to measure how well ads perform, such as whether users clicked on the ad or went to a client’s store after their ad campaign was shown.
Reporting: We may use a pseudonymous identifier to measure, attribute, and report on the performance and success of campaigns. This includes transaction reporting and verification.
Clicks and conversions: We may use a pseudonymous identifier to measure actions taken by a user with respect to a particular ad, i.e., a click on an ad, or a download of an app.
Attribution: We may use data to match particular ad views to subsequent actions taken by a user. For example, a clothing advertiser might be able to see that someone who saw an ad for gloves subsequently purchased the gloves. This would be done by stitching together the identifiers from the sites where the ad was served and where the online purchase was made.
Cross device graphing: We may use data and algorithms to associate pseudonymous identifiers that might be related to each other. Such a graph might link various identifiers present on a single device, various identifiers associated with an individual who has multiple devices or multiple device/​individuals within the same household.
Detection of malicious or invalid activity: We process information in an attempt to prevent malicious activity or invalid ad traffic. This may include identifying and preventing purveyors of malware or bots that try to take advertising dollars for ads that aren’t shown to real users or that try to harm users’ devices.
TARGETED ADVERTISING
Our Platform helps power ad targeting and delivery across many sites and apps with which users interact every day. Many of the activities described in the section above, such as personalizing ads, ad delivery, and cross-device graphing may involve The Trade Desk and our clients and partners processing data for purposes of “targeted advertising,” or engaging “sales,” or “sharing” of personal data under certain state privacy laws. See Your Rights and Choices below to learn how to express a choice related to these activities, or visit our
opt-out page
.
PERSONALISATION AND INTERESTS
Personalised profiles.
As part of our Platform, we may create and use user profiles associated with pseudonymous identifiers. This means that we look at the information associated with the IDs and with the requests for ads, such as the content in which the ad is shown, the time, the geographic location, and the type of device. Sometimes we use information about whether or how users responded to ads to find other users who would respond to ads. We apply various computational methods on this information to find groupings of IDs that may have certain common interests or characteristics, such as “clothing,” “sports,” “travel,” “male,” “25−54,” and so on. Our Platform also enables data suppliers to bring data to the Platform that our clients can use on the Platform to improve their ad campaigns.
Clients can bring their own data to the Platform for their own personalisation. Their sources and methods for acquiring this data vary and are subject to our clients’ own policies and legal obligations. We contractually prohibit certain types of data from being introduced onto the Platform, such as certain sensitive data. Our contracts prohibit clients and partners from using data on the Platform that is from or about users that they know are children.
Interests for groups.
We also create and use information that allows advertisers to understand what will be of interest to a group. We create a group of IP addresses in the same region of a country. We note what content we think is likely to be of interest to that group (as above, such as “clothing”, “sports” etc.) based on the sites users in those groups have visited. Advertisers may use this information to decide to show an ad to one of the IP addresses for the group. Identifiers for the group do not contain any personal data: the information only shows the types of content likely to be of interest to the group; we don’t create any individual profiles through this interest grouping mechanism. We keep these interests for groups segments for seven days.
DISCLOSURE AND TRANSFER
We will disclose your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this policy.
Some of the personal data processed on the Platform belongs to our clients. When this is the case, our clients can take this data, such as records of advertising impressions, off of the Platform. We also may disclose this personal data to other parties on the clients’ behalf and pursuant to their instructions.
We disclose mappings of pseudonymous IDs with clients and partners that use our device graphs.
We disclose cookie values to other advertising technology platforms so that they may match their value to our value.
Some of our clients and partners receive bid request data through the Platform for advertising purposes.
We may disclose personal data in order to investigate or prevent reasonably suspected malicious activity, fake traffic, or other activity that may be harmful to us or our clients.
We may disclose personal data to our service providers that store or process the personal data in furtherance of the services we offer on the Platform on our behalf.
We may transfer personal data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
We may disclose aggregated data that does not include individual-level records to any party or publicly.
We may disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES
Privacy rights.
Depending upon where you live, you may have certain legal rights with respect to personal data The Trade Desk collects and processes. These rights may include the right to request “access,” “deletion,” and “correction” of personal data, and the right to opt out of activities that constitute “sales,” “sharing,” and processing personal data for purposes of “targeted advertising,” as well as use of “sensitive data” for advertising purposes, as such terms are defined under applicable privacy laws. These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person or infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information that we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interest in keeping. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under applicable law.
Opting out of sales, sharing and targeted advertising.
As described in the Targeted Advertising section above, we process data to personalize and deliver ads, and for other ads-related purposes, including measurement reporting, and building our cross-device graph.

EUROPEAN UNION CONTROLLER/PROCESSOR DESIGNATION AND LEGAL BASES
If you are based in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom or Switzerland, The UK Trade Desk Ltd. is responsible for processing your personal data. Under the definitions of “Controller” and “Processor” in EU law, this processing is in some cases as a Controller of personal data and in some cases as a Processor. The Trade Desk is a Controller, for example, of personalised user interest segments that we create for our Platform, when we have appropriate permissions to do so.
When we collect personal data for personalisation from requests for ads that we receive as described above, under EU law, we will use consent as our legal basis for doing so. When we create identifiers for interests for groups, we use consent or legitimate interest as our legal basis. This depends on how we collect the personal data. We process personal data for other purposes when we have a legitimate interest in doing so and that interest is not outweighed by the rights or freedoms of individual data subjects.

UPDATED AND EFFECTIVE DATE: September 5, 2023
This notice (“
Notice
”) applies to you if you are a California resident who is a job applicant to, employee of, director of, officer of, or individual contractor of Philo (collectively “
you
”). It informs you about (1) the categories of Personal Information that we may collect about you, (2) the sources from which we collect Personal Information, (3) the purposes for which we may use that Personal Information, and (4) the third parties to whom Personal Information may be disclosed. “Personal Information” has the definition in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“
CCPA
”) and as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“
CPRA
”).
1. Your Privacy Rights
You have the right to request: (1) that we disclose to you what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell/share, including the right to request that we provide to you the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you (“
Right to Know
”) (2) that we delete the Personal Information we have collected from you (“
Right to Delete
”); (3) that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you (
“Right to Correct
”), (4) to opt out from the sharing of your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e. targeted advertising) (“
Right to Opt-Out of Sharing
”), (5) to opt-out from the sale of Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information (“
Right to Opt-Out of Sale
”), and (6) that we limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information to purposes set forth in the statute, including that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average person who requests those goods or services (“
Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
”). These rights are subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA and CPRA. More information on each of these rights is below.
a. Right to Know
You may request that we disclose the following information:
The categories of Personal Information we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or “selling” or “sharing” your Personal Information.
The specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.
The categories of Personal Information we have “sold” or “shared” or disclosed about you for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom your Personal Information was “sold,” “shared,” or disclosed for a business purpose.
To provide you with specific pieces of information, we may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the individual whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.
b. Right to Delete
You may request that we delete the Personal Information we have collected from you (and direct our Service Providers to do the same).
Please note that as part of the verification process, we may follow up after you submit your request and require you to confirm that you want your information deleted.
c. Right to Correct
You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate information we hold about you.
d. Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Right to Opt-Out of Sharing
We do not sell, or share for cross-contextual behavioral advertising, the Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about you. Therefore, we do not offer an opt-out for the sale of Personal Information or sharing of Sensitive Personal Information at this time.
e. Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
Under the CPRA Regulations, a business must only provide the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information when the information  (i) is collected or processed for the purpose of inferring characteristics about an individual, or (ii) does not fall under certain statutory exceptions, pursuant to CPRA §1798.121. Since Philo’s use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information is within one or more of these exceptions, we do not offer this right at this time.
