11. Personal Information Disclosure
CyberFight will disclose to you your personal information without delay if you request disclosure. However, we may decide not to disclose all or part of your personal information in any of the following cases, and in that case we will notify you to that effect without delay:
a case in which disclosure is likely to harm your or a third party’s life, body, property, or any other right or interest held by you or a third party;

13. Discontinuance of Utilization of Personal Information
If you request CyberFight to discontinue utilizing or to erase your personal information on the grounds that your personal information is being handled in a manner that exceeds the scope of the purpose of utilization publicly announced in advance or because your personal information has been acquired through deception or any other wrongful means, we will carry out any necessary inspection on your personal information without delay and, on the basis of the results, discontinue utilizing or erase your personal information and notify you to that effect. However, this provision does not apply in any case in which it requires excessively large costs or it is otherwise difficult to discontinue utilizing or to erase your personal information and in which we take necessary alternative measures to protect your rights and interests.

If you choose to provide us with personal information from outside Japan, it will be stored in Japan. CyberFight may transfer (by any means including sending or allowing access) that information across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting the Service from regions with laws governing data collection and use (except Japan, the European Union and the United Kingdom), please note that your personal data is transferred to Japan. Japan does not have the same data protection laws as the European Union or the United Kingdom and will not afford many of the rights conferred upon data subjects in the European Union or the United Kingdom.

the use of your personal information for the purposes specified in these Guidelines;
the transfer of your personal information to Japan as indicated above; and
that the laws of Japan shall apply.
If you are visiting the Service from the European Union or the United Kingdom, please note that your personal data is transferred to Japan.
