Halo Online Technology Co., Ltd. is committed to protect your privacy. Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to operate a world-class VPN service at scale. We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don't collect, and how we collect, use, and store information. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, i.e., no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration. We designed our systems not to have sensitive data about you; even when compelled, we cannot provide data that we do not possess.
This Privacy Policy describes how Halo Online Technology Co., Ltd. and its affiliates ("we," "our" or "us") collect, use, and share information in connection with your use of our websites, services, and applications (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") does not apply to information you may process when using our Services.
We guarantees a strict no-logs policy for our Services, meaning that your internet activity while using for Services is not monitored, recorded, logged, stored, or passed to any third party. We do not store used bandwidth, traffic logs, IP addresses, or browsing data. From the moment our user connects to one of our VPN servers, their internet data becomes encrypted.
