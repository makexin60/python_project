What is a Privacy Policy?
A privacy policy is a document that outlines how a company or app collects, uses, shares, and protects user data. It informs users about their rights regarding their personal information and ensures transparency about data handling practices.
The app collects advertising ID for showing ads and shares it with third parties like AdMob or Appodeal.
An advertising ID is a unique identifier assigned to a user's device by the operating system, allowing advertisers to track user activity and deliver personalized ads. This data collection and sharing practice enables the app to display targeted advertisements to users and may involve sharing collected advertising IDs with third-party advertising networks or platforms.
The app collects crash data or log data for improving performance and fixing issues.
Crash data or log data includes information generated by the app when it encounters errors, crashes, or unexpected behaviors during usage. This data helps developers identify and diagnose software bugs, prioritize bug fixes, enhance app stability, and improve overall user experience.
The app doesn't collect any other sensitive data.
Sensitive data refers to information that could potentially identify, harm, or expose an individual if disclosed or mishandled. By explicitly stating that the app doesn't collect any other sensitive data, users are reassured about the scope of data collection and the protection of their privacy.
The app is not intended for children.
This app is designed for general audiences and is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so that we can remove the information.
This privacy policy is managed by Ashenafi Siyume at Galaxy Studio. We do not collect personal information except for the advertising ID.
