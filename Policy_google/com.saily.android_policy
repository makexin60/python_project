In other cases, we may collaborate with partners as joint controllers meaning that we jointly define the purpose and means of data processing with them.

Business customer
”), we may share certain data related to their usage of our Services with that Business customer. In this case,  Saily and the Business customer act as separate and independent data controllers. This means that each party is responsible for its own compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. Saily may collect and share data such as service plans, usage patterns, and billing information for the purpose of managing, analyzing, and optimizing the Services provided. This data will be shared in accordance with a data sharing agreement between Saily and the Business customer, ensuring compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.

Users are encouraged to review these policies directly with their employer or contracting organization for detailed information on how their data is handled.

Investigations, courts & others.
We may provide personal data to law enforcement and pre-trial investigation authorities, courts and other dispute resolution authorities, and other persons performing functions assigned by law, in accordance with the legislation of the State of Delaware, United States of America.

Physical Measures.
We control access to our facilities with access cards. We also use security alarm systems and CCTV. We store devices with personal data information only in locked rooms or cabinets. Our printers are protected by access control measures. A clean desk policy is implemented.
Technical Measures.
We use layered defense with firewalls, anti-malware protection, intrusion detection, and prevention systems. Our infrastructure is regularly updated and regular vulnerability scans are in place to detect possible vulnerabilities. We have security event and incident management solutions to correlate and investigate signals in security tools. Servers are hardened and automated configuration tools are used to manage them. All workplaces are managed from a centralized endpoint management tool. Data at rest and in transit are encrypted. Encryption protocols are used according to the newest security practices.
Organizational Measures.

We analyze the threat landscape and attack surface and constantly update our security measures. Access to databases containing personal data is granted on a need-to-know basis.
If we detect something suspicious, we will notify users immediately and guide them through steps to stay better protected.

In the course of providing such services, these third-party service providers may have access to your personal data or other information. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services to us. Third party service providers have a data processing agreement enforced by 1GLOBAL, thus cascading to them the security and privacy requirements we uphold with you.

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including to comply with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting obligations. We ensure that personal data is securely deleted or anonymized when no longer needed, in compliance with Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

If we have collected and process your personal information based on your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time; withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. These rights are not absolute and may be subject to applicable laws and our own legitimate interests. If you want to contact us about any of your rights or complain about how we use your information, please contact us at dpo@1global.com
You have the right to file a complaint at any time with the Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados (CNPD), our lead supervisory authority in Portugal, or with the relevant data protection authority in your country. If you are located in the United Kingdom, your relevant data protection authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the data protection authority, so please contact us in the first instance.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you informed of the progress, including providing an estimated timeframe for our response, in accordance with Article 12(3) GDPR.
