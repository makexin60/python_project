The Data Protection Act 2018 is the UK’s implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The following section provides additional information regarding the lawful basis and purpose for data processing and specific rights regarding your personal data.
As a resident of the EEA&UK, you should know that the purposes of our data processing activities are being conducted on the following so-called “legal grounds”:
where it is necessary for us to fulfill contractual obligations between you and us (to provide you with access to our Games)
where it is necessary based on our legitimate interests to process your data (to help improve the delivery of our services, such as how users interact with our services and products; to perform internal operations, including fraud prevention, troubleshooting bugs and operational problems, and for data analysis, testing and research; and to serve personalized advertisements to users based on their interests.)
where it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations (as required by law)
As a resident of the EEA&UK, you also have certain specific rights regarding your personal data. You are free to exercise any of these rights by contacting us or as specified herein:
Access:
You have the right to request a copy of the personal data that we process about you. However, there are exceptions to this right, so that access may be denied if, for example, making the information available to you would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another person, or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information.
Accuracy:
We aim to keep your personal data accurate and complete. We encourage you to keep us informed about changes that you would like reflected in our records.
Objecting: I
n certain circumstances, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data. You may ask us to block, erase or limit the use or other processing of your personal data.
Data Portability:
You have the right to request that some of your personal data is provided to you, or to another provider should you wish to stop using our Services in favour of another, in machine-readable format.
Erase:
You have the right to erase or request that we erase your personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or if you think it has been used unlawfully.
International Transfer
We are based in Canada and the information that we process is protected by Canadian privacy laws. The information that we collect may be transferred, stored or used in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, where some of our service providers may be located. While we protect your information by choosing appropriate service providers and have contractual safeguards in place with those vendors, the privacy laws in such jurisdictions may not be as protective as in, for example, Canada or the EEA&UK, and may be subject to access by foreign governments, with or without your knowledge.
The information collected in the EEA&UK may be transferred to countries outside of the EEA&UK for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Personal data is transferred from the EEA&UK to Canada in accordance with the GDPR adequancy standards. Any other transfers to third countries will be done using mechanisms such as the GDPR’s
Standard Contractual Clauses
.
Specific rights for residents of California, USA
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants California consumers robust data privacy rights and control over their personal information, including the right to know, the right to delete, and the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information that businesses collect, as well as additional protections for minors. As a consumer, you have the right to request, twice a year and free of charge, certain information about parties to whom we have disclosed or sold your personal information in the prior calendar year and a description of the categories of personal information shared. Additionally, upon request, twice a year and free of charge, we shall provide to you any information relating to your personal information and our processing of your personal information in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear and plain language. To make such a request, please send an email to
privacy@mistplay.com
and please include the phrase
“Personal Information Privacy Request”
in the subject line, the Service you are inquiring about, along with your name, address, and email address. You can also ask us to delete your personal data stored on our platform. If we receive a request to delete your data, we will ask you if you want your personal information to be removed entirely or if you want to be kept on a list of individuals who do not want to be contacted in the future (for a specified period or otherwise). We cannot keep a record of individuals whose personal information we have deleted so you may be contacted again by us, should we come into possession of your personal information at a later date. Requests to know and requests to delete will be honored within 45 days; if more time is needed to respond, Mistplay will notify you.
The CCPA enables California users to appoint an authorized agent to act on their behalf to submit disclosure requests and or deletion requests under the CCPA.  The authorized agent must register with the California Secretary of State.  We will honor a request from an authorized agent provided you provide written authorization to the authorized agent to act on your behalf and we can verify your identity and the agent submits proof of authorization.
The following chart contains the categories of personal information, as enumerated in CCPA Sec. 1798.140(o), of personal information we may collect, use, and disclose, the sources of the personal information and our business and commercial uses of such personal information:
