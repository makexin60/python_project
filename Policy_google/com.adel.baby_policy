Extra Information for
AI Virtual Try On - GIGI
At GIGI, we prioritize the privacy and security of our users’ data. We do not collect, store, or retain sensitive face data or biometric information. The following outlines how we handle your photos and how we protect your privacy:
1.    Face Data Retention
•    Explicit Statement on Face Data:
GIGI does not collect or store any face data or biometric information. Users upload their photos, which include their face, to create virtual try-ons. These photos are processed using AI algorithms to apply outfits to the images. After processing, the photos are stored temporarily until the user decides to delete them.
2.    Reasons for Storing Photos
•    The photos are used solely for the purpose of creating virtual try-ons. The images are temporarily stored to facilitate the processing of the virtual outfits and to allow users to review their try-ons. Users can delete their photos at any time.
3.    Length of Time Photos Are Stored
•    Temporary Storage:
Photos are stored temporarily on our servers until the user decides to delete them. Once the user deletes a photo, it is removed from our servers within one month. This retention period is due to caching mechanisms that allow the app to handle data more efficiently. After one month, all data related to the photos, including cached images, is deleted from our servers.
•    Reason for Retention Period:
The retention period allows us to clear cached data. Once the photo is deleted by the user, all related data is deleted from both the app and our servers within one month, ensuring that no photos are stored indefinitely.
4.    Sharing Photos with Third Parties
•    No Face Data Shared:
GIGI does not share face data with third parties. However, user-uploaded photos are sent to third-party APIs to apply the virtual outfits and visualizations. These third-party services process the images temporarily to create the visualizations and return the processed data (outfit visualization) to GIGI.
5.    Reasons for Sharing Photos with Third Parties
•    We share the uploaded photos with third-party APIs for the sole purpose of applying virtual outfits and visualizations to the user’s image. These third-party services are essential for processing the photos and providing the virtual try-on experience.
6.    Third-Party Storage of Photos
•    Do Third Parties Store Photos?
The third-party services we use do not retain the photos after processing. Once the outfit visualization is applied, the data is returned to GIGI, and the photos are deleted from the third-party servers. No photos are stored by these services after the processing is complete.
•    Privacy Practices of Third Parties:
The third-party services we use adhere to strict privacy standards and do not store any face data. The photos are processed temporarily, and once the virtual try-on process is complete, they are deleted. These services do not retain any user photos for future use.
​
We value your privacy and work to protect your data. GIGI ensures that no sensitive data, including face data, is collected or retained without your consent. Your photos are used solely for creating virtual try-ons, and once you delete them, they are removed from both the app and our servers as described above.
