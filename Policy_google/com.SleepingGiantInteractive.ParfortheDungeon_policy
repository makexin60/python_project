PRIVACY POLICY
Sleeping Giant Interactive Inc. (“SGI”) provides this Privacy Policy to explain how it collects, stores, and uses the information collected in connection with SGI’s software applications, and websites (collectively, “services”). SGI respects the privacy of their users and is committed to protecting the user’s information. You have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you use our services.
The types of information we collect and how we collect it
Personal Information
SGI integrates third party SDKs into our services. These SDKs are used for advertising to our users, analyzing service usage, enabling in-app purchases, or providing game services including achievements, leaderboards, and account management. We allow third party operators this collected data solely for internal operations of the service as permitted by applicable rules and laws. This could include, but is not limited to, persistent advertising identifiers, geolocation information, and IP address. We encourage you to review the policies of the third party operators listed below.
Should a user explicitly provide it to us when prompted, we will collect email addresses of our users for our mailing list(s), account recovery, or customer support purposes.
Some of our services require or allow a user to provide a screen name so they can be identified within the service.
Non-personal Information
We allow third parties to collect some information by which users cannot be identified. Non-personal information may include technical information about your device, such as your browser type, screen resolution, device type, language, type of operating system and geo location (only general location). Non-personal information is gathered by third party services while you are accessing the service. They are allowed to use this information to conduct research and analysis, but only for strictly limited purposes. We encourage you to review the policies of the third party operators listed below.
Internally, SGI also reserves the right to collect anonymous information for research and analysis. This information is generic in nature and cannot be used to individually identify a user. This information is collected each time a user runs one of our services.
Service Specific Information
We may use a user’s profile picture and username from social networks or game services, but this will stay on the device and will not be transmitted to us.
What we do with the personal information we collect
Advertisers collect data regarding advertisement performance, user’s interaction with ads, our apps and user’s interests. Collected data may include user’s personal information in order to serve users ads and for the third parties’ legitimate business interests.
When a service asks for a username, it is used to visually identify that user to other users playing the game. SGI prohibits any user under the age of 13 from providing individually identifiable information in their username or screen name. This includes, but is not limited to the user’s first name, last name, email address, and physical address.
What we do with the non-personal information we collect
Third party operators are allowed to collect and use non-personal information to conduct research and analysis, or to target advertisements, or other limited purposes. This information cannot be used to individually identify any user. We encourage you to review the policies of the third party operators listed below.
Similarly, SGI also uses non-personal information to conduct research and analysis. We do this to improve our services in future updates or to gain knowledge about how our users our interacting with the service.
What we do with service specific information we collect
If SGI collects identifiers associated with a user’s account on social networks like Facebook or Twitter, or game services like Apple Game Center, or Google Play Game Services, then it is explicitly required for some feature in that service. For example, the identifier could be saved so that a user’s connections on the social network can see their high score or progress in the game. As stated elsewhere in this policy, you can contact us to have this information deleted for yourself or your child under the age of 13.
How to opt-out of targeted advertising
If you would like to opt-out of interest-based advertising, you may do so in your mobile device’s settings. On iOS, this can be done by turning on the Limit Ad Tracking option under Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising. On Android, this can typically be found under Settings -> Google -> Ads -> Opt out of Ads Personalization, although the exact location of this setting may differ depending on your device make and Android version.

Children
We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and safety of children using our services, as outlined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under 13.
When we determine that a service is directed at children under the age of 13, we will configure all of our internal systems such that no personal information will be collected, and configure all relevant third-party integrations appropriately such that no personal information will be collected for users of that service. For additional information, please refer to the privacy policies of our third party operators to understand what they are doing to further protect your child’s privacy.
Services that are determined to be targeted at children will still receive advertisements from our third-party operators, and promotions from SGI using its internal systems. In this case the ads and promotions will not be targeted based on collected data, but will be broadcast to all users of the service.
If you are a parent of a child under 13 years of age and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us using the information below and we will delete the information from our systems.
Disclosure of Personal information
The scenarios in which we will share your personal data are as follows:
we determine that it is required by law;
we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property;
we are participating in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets;
we have your consent; and
as described above in relation to third-party operators collecting information from our services.
Under no other circumstances will SGI share, sell, rent, or release your data.
You may contact SGI to
request access, change, update or delete
your personal information at any time via email: support@sleepinggiantgames.com. You have the right to these options as well as the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these options. A small fee may be imposed for access and disclosure of your personal information, where permitted under applicable law.
Security
We follow generally accepted industry standards and internal procedures to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
Third Party Operators
Advertising Networks: SGI allows advertisements from the Third Party ad networks to be displayed in our services. SGI makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the third party ad networks are configured to comply with applicable privacy laws, and we reasonably believe this to be the case for each of them. If we determine a service to be directed at children under the age of 13, we configure each of these ad networks to be compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). For persons in European Union countries, we also configure networks to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation of 2016 (GDPR).
In-App Purchases: In order to make in-app purchases, a user must use a third party checkout option that we have integrated with our services to finalize and pay for their order. The third party operator’s privacy policy and security practices will apply to this process and the user’s information. We encourage you to read that privacy statement before providing your information.
Social Networks: Some of our services integrate a third-party social network such as Facebook or Twitter to allow sharing progress with friends, or allowing them to be invited to use our service. The privacy policy of each social network will indicate what data is available to us and how we use it.
Game Services: Many of our services integrate either Apple Game Center, or Google Play Game Services. Each of these third-party operators offer their own privacy policy (listed below), and we encourage you to review them.
Analytics: SGI makes use of Third Party services in order to measure how users utilize our services so that we may improve them, and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.
The following is a comprehensive list of the third party operators we currently use in our services, their contact information, and links to their privacy policies. Please note that each individual service we provide will only use a subset of these operators:
