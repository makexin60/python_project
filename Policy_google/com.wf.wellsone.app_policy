This California Consumer Privacy Act Notice at Collection ("Notice") is provided by the Wells Fargo companies described below. These companies are referred to in this Notice as "we" or "us."
This Notice explains how we collect, use, retain, and disclose personal information about California residents. The Notice also explains certain rights that California residents have under the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”).
The CCPA only applies to information about residents of California. If you are a resident of a U.S. state other than California, you may submit a request and we may process it, as described in this Notice, even though the CCPA does not require us to do so. In accepting, processing, and responding to requests by individuals who are not California residents, we will apply all the same limitations and exceptions under the CCPA to those requests as apply to requests made by California residents. We reserve the right to change or stop the practice of accepting requests from U.S. residents of states other than California, except as otherwise required by law.
Under the CCPA, "personal information" is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California resident or household. This information is referred to in this Notice as "Personal Data."

Requests Under the CCPA
The CCPA defines a “sale” as the disclosure of Personal Data for monetary or other valuable consideration. Wells Fargo does not sell and has not, within the last 12 months, sold Personal Data, including Sensitive Personal Information. Furthermore, we have no actual knowledge that we sell or share (for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising) Personal Data, including Sensitive Personal Information, of minors under 16 years of age.
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request that we:
Disclose to you the following information ("Request to Know"):
The categories of Personal Data we collected about you and the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Data;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or sharing Personal Data about you;
The categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Data about you, and the categories of Personal Data disclosed;
The categories of Personal Data about you that we shared and the categories of third parties with whom we shared such Personal Data; and
The specific pieces of Personal Data we collected about you.
Delete Personal Data we collected from you ("Request to Delete").
Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you ("Request to Correct").
Opt you out of "sharing", for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, ("Request to Opt-Out of Sharing").
In addition, you have the right to be free from discrimination by a business for exercising your CCPA privacy rights, including the right as an employee, applicant, or independent contractor not to be retaliated against for exercising your CCPA privacy rights.

How to Make Requests
If you are a California resident, you can make a Request to Know, Delete, or Correct by:
Contacting us at
1-844-774-9229
; or
Submitting your request at
www.wellsfargo.com/privacycenter/
.
Wells Fargo Online
®
customers and Wells Fargo employees: you can make a request by using your existing Wells Fargo log-in credentials.
For all other individuals, we will ask you to provide the following information to identify yourself:
Name, contact information, Social Security or individual taxpayer identification number, and date of birth; and
A copy of a government-issued photo ID. We accept your driver’s license, state ID, or matricula card.
When you make a Request to Know, Delete, or Correct, we will attempt to verify that you are who you say you are. For example, we will attempt to match information that you provide in making your Request with other sources of similar information to reasonably verify identity.

.
Responding to Requests
Privacy and data protection laws, other than the CCPA, apply to much of the Personal Data that we handle. When these other laws apply, Personal Data may be exempt from, or outside the scope of, a request to Know, Delete, or Correct. For example, information subject to certain federal privacy laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability, is exempt from CCPA Requests. As a result, we may decline all or part of your Request to the extent that it relates to exempt Personal Data. This means that we may not provide, delete, correct, or opt-out some, or all, of this Personal Data when you make a CCPA Request.
As examples, our processing of, or response to, a CCPA Request may not include some or all of the following Personal Data:
Consumer Accounts.
Personal Data related to consumer accounts used for personal, family, or household purposes and applications for such accounts. We have other privacy notices providing certain information on use and sharing of this data, for example, the Wells Fargo U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice, available at
www.wellsfargo.com/privacy-security
.
The types of Personal Data described above are examples. We have not listed all types of Personal Data that may not be included when we respond to or process CCPA Requests.
In addition to the above examples, we may not include Personal Data when we respond to or process CCPA Requests when the CCPA recognizes another exception. For example, we will not provide the Personal Data about another individual when doing so would adversely affect the data privacy rights of that individual. As another example, we will not delete Personal Data when it is necessary to maintain that Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation.
We will verify and respond to your request consistent with applicable law, taking into account the type and sensitivity of the Personal Data subject to the request.
Authorized Agents
If you are a California resident, you may authorize an agent to make a request on your behalf. A California resident's authorized agent may make a request on behalf of the California resident by using the submission methods listed above under “How To Make Requests.”  As part of our verification process, we may request that you provide, as applicable:

For a company or organization ("legal entity requestor") making a request on behalf of a California resident:

Introduction and scope of policy
This Wells Fargo Digital Privacy and Cookies Policy ("Policy") applies to your interaction with Wells Fargo & Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Wells Fargo," "we," "us," "our"): (1) at any online or mobile site or application that we own and control ("Site"), unless a different online and/or mobile or other privacy policy is posted relating to a particular site, application, product, or service, or is made available to you and by its terms supplants this Policy; or (2) via a Wells Fargo advertisement, page, or account on a third party site. We may collect, retain, use, and disclose personal and other information about you in accordance with this Policy. Other privacy policies may also apply in addition to the terms of this Policy.
Additional privacy policies and notices
Certain additional Wells Fargo privacy-related policies and notices that may apply are posted on the
Privacy, Cookies, Security, and Legal
page, or provided to you at the point of collection, or at the time of obtaining a product or service, such as the Wells Fargo California Consumer Privacy Act Notice ("CCPA Notice"). The CCPA Notice explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information about California residents and how California residents can exercise rights under the CCPA.
The additional policies and notices also include the
Wells Fargo U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice (PDF)
(which applies to U.S. customers and consumers as described in that notice) and various international privacy policies (which apply to information collected by us outside of the U.S. as described in those policies). You may also receive an additional privacy notice in connection with your use of a particular product or relationship with a specific business. For example, Trust or fiduciary accounts for which Wells Fargo is the trustee or service provider, including employer-sponsored retirement accounts, are protected under special rules of confidentiality, which are addressed in the applicable privacy notices. Please note that where we have another type of presence on a site owned by a third party, such as a page or handle on a social media site, that third party’s privacy policy and terms of use will apply to the third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of data (rather than this Policy), unless specifically stated otherwise.
Agreement to policy
To the extent permitted by applicable law, by using a Site or interacting with a Wells Fargo advertisement or page or account on a third-party site, you consent to this Policy, including your consent to our use and disclosure of information about you in the manner described in this Policy.
Collecting, using, and disclosing information
Types of information
You may interact with us in a variety of ways online, including through a mobile device. We may offer sites or applications that permit browsing and do not require registration. We may also offer the ability to enroll, register, or access your accounts online. Information that we may collect about you through online interaction includes information that you input, such as your name, address, email address, and other contact information; data resulting from your activity, such as transaction information and the pages you visit on Site; geolocation information; and biometric information, such as keystroke and mouse movement patterns. We may also collect additional information, such as the type of device and browser you are using, the IP address of your device, information about your device’s operating system, and additional information associated with your device. We may also collect information through cookies, tags, and other technologies, as described further below.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that your browser stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site. When you return to a site you have visited before, your browser gives this data back to the site to help it remember your preferences and personalize your experience; enhance site performance and security; and enable interest-based advertising. When you visit our Site, we, or our service providers, may use cookies or other similar technologies to collect information on our Site.
How we use cookies
We use cookies and information collected through their use to make your experience with Wells Fargo and certain other sites richer and more personalized based on the products, services, or other interactions you have with us and other sites. Information collected through use of cookies may be used to make offers to you via online ads, email, U.S. mail, or telephone, subject to the privacy preferences you have on file with Wells Fargo. (Privacy preferences for employer-sponsored retirement accounts default to no marketing, solicitation, or sharing for marketing purposes without specific consent.) We use cookies, sometimes in conjunction with service providers, in online advertising either on our own Site or on third party sites to help determine which of our advertisements are most likely to appeal to you. We also use cookies for purposes such as maintaining continuity during an online session, collecting data about the use of our Site, monitoring online promotions, and anti-fraud and information security purposes.
Other parties that may collect information about your web browsing behavior when you use our Site are generally limited to service providers who may only use any information collected to provide services and marketing for us and not to provide services or advertising for any other party. Note, however, that we also provide certain links on our sites that allow you to interact with third parties who offer additional features, such as allowing web surfers to share information on another platform, such as a social media platform. At other times, information from a third party may be embedded on our Site, such as a map. These features often function through the use of third-party cookies utilized by the third-party site, such as a social media platform. As a result, if you use any of these features, these third parties may be able to access information about your web browsing on the pages of our Site where links to these features are in place. You may wish to review information at third party sites, such as social media platforms where you have an account, to determine how these third parties treat data that they obtain with the use of cookies.
Types of cookies we use
There are two types of cookies, session and persistent.
Session cookies
expire at the end of a web browsing session when you close your browser. They help the site remember your actions during the current website visit.
Persistent cookies
remain stored on your device between browsing sessions until a pre-set expiration period determined by us or our service providers. These types of cookies allow us to improve website experiences and place advertisements.
There are four categories of cookies we may use on our Site:
Strictly necessary:
These cookies are necessary for our site to function or to enable functionality requested by you. They’re needed to do things like securely signing on to our site, applying for a product or service, or honoring a language preference. You can set your browser to block all cookies, but some parts of our site won't work without them.
Functional:
These cookies enable an enhanced or personalized experience. They may be set by us or third-party providers whose services we have available on our site. This may include things like playing videos on our site or downloading PDF forms or seeing content personalized to you. If these cookies are blocked, then some of these services may not function.
Performance and analytical:
These cookies allow us to monitor the performance of our website, such as how many people are visiting our site and how they got there, so we can measure and improve your experience on our site. If these are blocked, we have less information available to us to continue to improve our site.
Marketing and advertising:
These cookies may be set by us or through our advertising partners. This information is used to understand your use of our site so we may show you more relevant online content and advertising. If you block or turn them off, you may still see online advertisements, but they won’t be tailored to you based on your browsing behavior.
You can manage cookies
Managing cookies is domain and browser specific. For example, you may manage our use of certain types of cookies on the wellsfargo.com domain or by using an industry accepted opt-out preference signal such as the Global Privacy Control (see more details below). Your preference applies to this domain and the browser you are currently using. It does not apply to different browsers or other Wells Fargo managed domains. If you visit this domain using a different browser or delete your browser cookies, you will need to exercise your preference again. If you visit other Wells Fargo managed domains, such as wellsfargojobs.com, click on the Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information link in the footer for that domain to manage your preference.
Global Privacy Control (GPC)
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a service that lets you opt out of sharing information for targeted advertising on nonaffiliated websites, applications, or services. You can enable this service through specific browsers or browser extensions (see which browsers are GPC-enabled at the
Global Privacy Control
Opens Dialog
website). Once you activate the GPC setting, your browser will automatically send participating websites (like ours) a “do not sell or share my personal information” signal.
Industry standards are currently evolving, and we may not separately respond to or take any action with respect to a "do not track" configuration set in your internet browser.
Additional options to manage cookies
If you receive an ad delivered on a third-party site in part based on information collected through the use of cookies, you may opt out of receiving such ads by visiting the
Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out link
Opens Dialog
or the
Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out link
Opens Dialog
and learn how to opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising from companies that participate in those programs. This opt-out works via cookies set on a particular browser, so if you delete cookies from your browser, or use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out again.
For mobile devices, you can
turn off personal ads on iOS devices
Opens Dialog
or
opt out of ads personalization on Android devices
Opens Dialog
.
Additional technologies
We may also use additional technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, SDKs, and clear GIFs, and may permit our third-party service providers to use these technologies. We use these technologies for purposes such as measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements or other communications, determining viewing and response rates, and determining which offers to present to you on our own or on third party sites. By using the Site, you consent to the use of analytics and monitoring tools to collect user interaction with our products, unless prohibited by law. These interactions are collected using cookies and technical log files. We use the data for purposes that include interaction monitoring and visual replay for fraud, customer service, product improvement, and other purposes allowed by law.
Using information
In addition to the uses described above, we use information for purposes as allowed by law such as: servicing; communicating with you; improving our Site, products, or services; legal compliance; risk control; information security; anti-fraud purposes; marketing or personalizing the presentation of our products and services to you; or tracking email access or website usage, such as number of hits, pages visited, and the length of user sessions in order to evaluate the usefulness of our sites.
Disclosing information
We may disclose information to service providers with whom we work, such as data processors and companies that help us market products and services to you. When permitted or required by law, we may disclose information to additional third parties for purposes including response to legal process. As applicable, please see the additional privacy policies referenced above, such as the
Wells Fargo U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice (PDF)
, for more information on how we may share information with affiliates and third parties.
Children’s privacy
Our Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from such children.
Policy updates and effective date
If we make updates to this Policy, we will update the Policy with the changes and revise the "date of most recent update" posted at the top of this Policy. Any updates to the Policy become effective when we post the updates on the Site. To the extent permitted by applicable law, your use of the Site following the update to the Policy means that you accept the updated Policy.
