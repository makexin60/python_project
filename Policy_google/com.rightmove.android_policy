Who collects and uses your information?
The Nationwide Group
Under data protection law, an organisation that decides how the personal information it collects and holds is used is called a ‘data controller’. We call this use of personal information ‘processing’. If you’re a member or customer of Nationwide Building Society, the data controller of your personal information is Nationwide Building Society.
Nationwide Building Society has a number of subsidiary companies and overseas branches and is a member of various limited liability partnerships. These include Virgin Money (UK) plc, Nationwide Covered Bonds LLP, The Mortgage Works (UK) plc, E-Mex Home Funding Ltd and Derbyshire Home Loans Lts.
In some cases, one of these companies or partnerships will be the data controller.
When we say ‘Nationwide’, ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’, we mean the Nationwide business that is the data controller of your personal information.
What information does Nationwide collect and hold?
The information we collect and hold
The information we might collect and hold about you includes:
Personal information to identify and contact you, such as your name, address, contact details and date of birth.

Other information that you supply to us or that we obtain from our relationship with you. For example, information relevant to an insurance claim you make or about your marketing preferences. This could include sensitive information (e.g. something you tell us about your health – we call this '
special category data
'.
When we talk about ‘information’ throughout this page, we’re referring to all of these items.

In certain situations, we may use information that you've made public such as tweets or social media content too (e.g. when you interact with our social media profiles, like @AskNationwide on X).

If someone acting on your behalf provides this information, we'll record what's been provided and who gave it to us.

When we can use your information
We’re able to use your information for the purposes outlined above, where one of the following applies:
We use the information to carry out our obligations to you, as part of an agreement between you and Nationwide.
We must use the information to comply with the law or in the public interest.
We use the information to carry out our legitimate business interests.
You have given us consent to use the information.
We use your information to protect your vital interests (e.g. in very exceptional circumstances when we believe it’s in your best interests).
You can find out more about how we use your information in the next sections.
Checking your identity and confirming it is you
We collect and use your personal information to check your identity when you open an account, product or service with us, and from time to time throughout our relationship. When you use the banking app this this could include some biometric information, which may be held by our trusted third parties, with your consent.
How do we use your information in this way?
We use your information to check that it's you when you open an account. To do this, we collect and share your information with databases held by credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. This is so that we can verify your identity.
Why do we use your information in this way?
It's all about keeping your money and personal details safe. We check your identity to:
Make it harder for criminals to use false names and addresses, steal the identities of innocent people and access financial products and systems by pretending to be you.
Help prevent fraud and stop money laundering.
Uphold our legal obligations and complete necessary due diligence checks to make sure we know our customers.
You can find out more on why we check your identity and the types of documents we'll need to do this on our
proving your identity
page.
We may also check your identity for our legitimate business interests. For example, to follow guidance and best practice set by our regulators. However, we'll always make sure that the way we process your information is not unfair to you.
In certain circumstances, you have the right to object to us processing your personal information. Discover more about this, and your other rights, in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
Helping to manage your accounts and relationship with us
We need to use your personal information to keep in touch with you, take care of your accounts, products and services, and look after your membership. We'll collect and use your details to:
Process your application for a product or service with us, either directly with us or through an intermediary.
Provide services based on your relationship with us e.g. issuing cards, administering payments on a current account or paying interest on a savings product.
Provide members with access to additional, secure ways to pay or bank.
Manage your membership with Nationwide and keep in touch with you.
Send you communications to service your accounts, products and services.
Manage any queries and complaints you might have.
Make sure the data we hold about you is correct and up to date.
To assess and accommodate our service to meet your needs.
In managing your accounts and relationship with us, we may use information we already hold about you (e.g. your address and contact details). This is so we provide you with the best experience (e.g. by pre-populating sections on certain application forms, so you don't have to) and ensure that we hold consistent and correct information about you across our systems.
How do we use your information in this way?
We'll process your information in this way when it's required as part of the terms and conditions agreed between us, and also when you ask us to carry out activities that need your authorisation (e.g. when you ask us to make a payment).
We may also need to use profiling (where we use your information to categorise groups of members and customers together based on their behaviours and interactions). This helps us make sure that we're being fair and consistent in the way we treat our members and customers.
We may need to use your information when it's necessary for our legitimate business interests. This will mainly be so that we can uphold our commitment as a responsible lender, follow guidance from our regulators and protect our member's financial security. We'll always ensure the way we process your information is safe and not unfair to you.

You have the right to object to us using your information for legitimate interests. Find out more about this in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
Checking your credit reference and making sure products and services are affordable
Sometimes, we'll need to share your personal information with a credit reference agency to check that a product or service is right for you.
We do this to:
Assess your creditworthiness, once you are over 18, and consider whether we believe you can afford to take out a product or service.
Check the information you've provided to us is accurate.
Prevent criminal activity and financial crime including fraud and money laundering.
Manage your ongoing relationship with us (e.g. managing your arranged overdraft limit, once you are over 18).
Trace and recover debts.
Make sure any offers we propose are appropriate (when we have the right to do so).
Four things you need to know about credit referencing:
When we ask a credit reference agency to do a search on our behalf, this may leave a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. This happens whether or not you, or Nationwide, choose to proceed with the application.
The number of searches carried out may have an impact on credit decisions made by us and other lenders.
If you're making a joint application, your credit records will be linked together. This creates what's known as a ‘financial association' at credit reference agencies. So, you should always discuss and agree this with other applicants before disclosing their information to check that they're happy to proceed.
Information about any financial associations will be shared with other lenders if either of you make a credit application in the future – whether it's in just your name or together with someone else. Nationwide may receive and use information about your existing financial associations as part of our decision-making process.
Why do we share your information with credit reference agencies?
We'll share your information with a credit reference agency when it's necessary in line with the terms and conditions agreed between us. This could be when you're applying for a product or as part of our ongoing relationship with you.
We also collect and use your information to help us improve our credit risk systems and policies to make sure we meet the needs of our customers. Discover more about this in the
enhancing your experience of our products and services - PDF 49KB (opens in a new window).
As a responsible lender, it's in our legitimate business interests to make sure the products we provide you are affordable and suitable for your circumstances. So, we share your information with credit reference agencies to check that we have sufficient data to make well-informed decisions about offering credit – decisions that don't put you at risk. It also helps to make sure other lenders have a clear picture of your credit history and how you manage your accounts, so they can assess the affordability of their products and services.
We believe it's in the interests of you, Nationwide and other lenders to allow fair decisions to be made when offering credit.
You have the right to object to us using your information for our legitimate interests. Find out more about this in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
More about credit reference agencies
There are three key credit reference agencies that we use. Take a look at their Credit Reference Agency Information Notices (CRAINs) to find out more about them, the data they hold (and for how long), the way they use and share your information, how they prevent fraud and your data protection rights.
The three agencies are:
TransUnion (opens in a new window)
Equifax (opens in a new window)
Experian (opens in a new window)
Verifying your income and employment through Experian’s Work Report service
If we use the Experian Work Report Service, we’ll supply your personal information to Experian (name, address, date of birth, email address, employer name and National Insurance Number).
Experian will provide us with confirmation that you are employed by who you have told us, how long you’ve been employed by them and your pay information (which includes the information you see on your payslip). We will use that information to verify your income and employment.
Experian collects this information from your employer through their payroll or benefits provider or from your tax agent .
For more information on the Experian Work Report Service and what will happen to your information, please read the Experian privacy notice at
www.experian.co.uk/WRPP (opens in a new window)
.
By submitting your application to us, you agree that Experian can access and share your income and employment information with us.
Three things you need to know about Experian’s Work Report service:
The income verification check does not leave a search footprint on your credit file and does not affect your credit score.
Other lenders won’t be able to see this check.
Your employer is not notified of this check.
Preventing financial crime
At Nationwide, our members' and customers' safety is our number one priority. And that's exactly why we collect and use your information to confirm that you are who you say you are, and to help stop financial crime including fraud and money laundering.
How do we use your information in this way?
We share your personal information with fraud prevention agencies to help prevent financial crime. If required for fraud or criminal investigation reasons, we (and the fraud prevention agencies) may also allow law enforcement agencies to access and use your information.
What information do we share?
The personal information we might need to share in this way includes your:
name
address
date of birth
financial information
employment details
Identifying information (such as your IP address).
We'll share your information in this way when it's necessary as part of the terms and conditions agreed between us, either when you're applying for a product or as part of our ongoing relationship.
Why do we share your information in this way?
We have a legitimate business interest to check people's identity, and identify and prevent financial crime including fraud and money laundering. Sharing your information in this way, when necessary, allows us to protect your financial security as well as that of our other members and customers. It also makes sure that we're complying with the law.
You have the right to object to us processing your information in line with our legitimate interests. Find out more about this in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
A little bit about automated decisions
Sometimes when processing people's personal information, we might use technology that makes automated decisions about our members and customers. This means that we may automatically decide that someone poses a financial crime risk if:
The information processed reveals behaviour that indicates financial crime.
The information provided is different to information previously given.
Someone appears to have deliberately hidden their true identity.
You have rights related to automated decision making. You can find out more about these by taking a look at the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
What happens if a financial crime risk is detected?
We take financial crime seriously. And if we, or a fraud prevention agency, believe that someone poses a financial crime risk then we may refuse to provide the services that they've asked for. We can also stop providing services they already have with us.
If they apply for a job with us, and financial crime is detected, we may not employ them. Or, if they work for us already, we may stop their employment.
A record of any fraud risk will be kept by the fraud prevention agencies and this could mean that other providers refuse to offer services, finances or employment. Fraud prevention agencies can hold onto someone's personal data for different periods of time, depending on the situation. If someone is considered a fraud risk, their data can be held for up to six years.
Fraud prevention agencies such as Cifas may transfer your personal information outside of the UK, this may be to a country where the UK Government has decided that your information will be protected to UK standards. If it is any other country, fraud prevention agencies will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to continue to protect your personal information.
Any questions?
If you have any questions about financial crime prevention, and how we use your information in this way, don't hesitate to

.
Providing products and services from our partners
Sometimes, we might need to collect and use your information to provide, introduce or distribute products and services from our partners (e.g. an investment product). This could also apply to benefits that come as part of your account (e.g. travel insurance).
How do we use your information in this way?
We'll share necessary information with our partners when:
You hold, or are applying for, an insurance policy or investment product underwritten and managed by one of our partners (e.g. our Home Insurance and Investment Funds).
We need to let them know that you're a Nationwide member with a packaged account (e.g. FlexPlus) and you need to receive insurance cover (subject to eligibility).
Discussing any claims, queries or complaints that may arise.
To help them provide products and services to us.
We need to update them about a change to your address or contact details.
Our partners will also collect and use your information to manage the products and services that you have with them. As this then makes them the ‘data controller', they'll provide more details on how they process your information at the time when it's collected by them or shared by Nationwide.
When selecting our partners, we take appropriate steps to make sure that they have adequate protection in place and that they follow data protection legislation.
Why do we need to use your information for this?
We'll use your personal information to meet the promises we've made in the terms and conditions of your product or service. We also use your information to understand your needs so that we can accurately advise on the products and services that are right for you.
We may also use it for our legitimate business interests. For example, when we need to make sure that the terms you've agreed to will be upheld, or to follow best practice from regulators.
We'll always keep your best interests at heart and make sure that the way we process your information isn't unfair to you.
You have the right to object to us using your information for our legitimate interests. Find out more about this in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
We may also need to ask for 'special category data' (such as information about your health) from time to time, to check whether certain products and services are suitable. You'll find out more about this in our
special category data
section.
Helping in challenging times with debt recovery
We collect and use your personal information to:
Assess the likelihood that your circumstances have changed.
Work with you through challenging times, by understanding and supporting your needs.
Recover any outstanding money owed to us (this could include trying to locate you).
Help us decide on any further action we may need to take in order to recover money owed (e.g. whether we need to consider legal action or using a debt recovery agent).
How do we use your information in this way?
We'll process your information in this way when it's necessary to meet the promises we've made in the terms and conditions of your product or service, and also when you ask us to carry out activities that need your authorisation (e.g. when you've requested for someone to act on your behalf or if you choose to give us information about your health or any criminal convictions).
When necessary, we'll share your information with individuals and organisations that you've asked to act on your behalf (e.g. Citizens Advice and Step Change) as well as credit reference agencies, solicitors, tracing and debt collection agents, home visit agents and debt purchasers.
To carry out these activities, we may need to use profiling (where we use your information to categorise groups of members and customers together based on their behaviours and interactions). This helps us make sure that we're being fair and consistent in the way we treat our members and customers and also to support those who may be experiencing financial difficulty.
We may also use your information for our legitimate business interests. Rest assured, we'll always ensure that the way we process your information is safe and not unfair to you.

'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
Information about defaults
We'll always look to work with you if you get into financial difficulty, so please do get in touch with us first if you're struggling to make repayments.
If we fail to reach an agreement to repay the debt, we'll issue a notice that gives you 28 days to bring your payments up to date. If you don't bring your payment up to date by then, we'll record a default with credit reference agencies and this will remain on their records for up to 6 years.
Sharing relevant marketing about products and services
How do we use your information in this way?
We want you to get the most out of your relationship with Nationwide. One of the ways we might help you do this is by using the contact details you’ve supplied us to send you marketing information about products or services we think you'll find interesting. For example, it might be a monthly e-newsletter keeping you updated on what’s happening with your Building Society. Or it could be info about a new type of savings account designed to help your nest-egg grow quicker.
We also collect and use your information to help us plan and tailor the delivery of our marketing campaigns.  Discover more about this in our
enhancing your experience of our products and services - PDF 49KB (opens in a new window).
Your marketing preferences, your choice
When it comes to receiving marketing, you're in control. And you’re free to choose if you want to hear from us at all and how – whether that’s by post, phone, email or through messages on our Internet Bank or Banking app. It’s also fine if you change your mind. As a member, you can update your marketing preferences at any time.
Update your details:
In the Internet Bank.
On the Banking app under My Details & Settings.

In branch
By writing to us at Freepost SCE 7125, Swindon, SN38 9LY.
Our marketing on websites and social media
We want you to get the most out of your relationship with Nationwide. So we use social media companies and website publishers to let you know about the products and services we offer that might be of interest to you.
One of the ways we do this is by matching the personal details we hold about you, such as your email address, with the details social media companies or website publishers hold about you. This is done in a controlled way so your identity is never revealed.
By doing this, social media companies and website publishers can share tailored marketing messages with you about our products and services.
We have strict processes in place to keep your personal information safe and we won't use it in a way that's unfair to you.
We do this by:
Never sharing any other personal information about you with social media companies or website publishers.
Making sure your information doesn’t give your identity away by making it anonymous in a secure and controlled environment.
Using carefully selected social media companies and website publishers, such as Reach PLC. We take steps to make sure your information will not be used for any reason other than showing you marketing messages from us that we think you’ll be interested in.
Never agreeing to your information being sold to third parties.
Making sure that your information is securely deleted.
You have the right to object to us using your information for legitimate interests. You can find out more about this, and your other rights, in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section. Just so you know, if you do submit a ‘right to object request’ we will stop sending you marketing messages tailored to you. However, you might still see some general marketing messages from us, but these won’t be targeted to you.
If you want to control the adverts you see on social media platforms and websites, you can often manage your marketing preferences through their settings page. In some cases, you can opt out of receiving targeted marketing messages. You’ll still see adverts, but these won’t be tailored to you.
Managing your marketing preferences if you are a commercial customer
We want you and your business to get the most out of your relationship with Nationwide – no matter what type of commercial account you have with us. So if we have your name down as a contact or associated party (e.g. an authorised signatory), we may send you marketing information from time to time about products or services we think could be of interest – or that could help you grow your business.
We have a legitimate business interest to use your information in this way due to the relationship you have with us as someone associated with one of our commercial products.  We ‘ll only use this information in a way which is fair to you and you can update your marketing preferences at any time by writing to us at FREEPOST SCE 7125, Swindon SN38 9LY.
Important note:  If you have a personal account too (e.g. a personal savings account), just bear in mind that you’ll need to check and update these marketing preferences separately. You can do this any time in the Internet Bank (under My Details), on the Banking app (in Details & Settings), or by going into your local branch.
And don’t worry, even if you’d rather not get marketing messages, we’ll still make sure you always receive important information about your accounts (for example, when your online statements are available).
We’ll never pass on your details to anyone else for their marketing purposes either.
Meeting our legal and regulatory obligations
At Nationwide, we're required to collect and use your personal information in a number of circumstances to meet our legal and regulatory obligations.
These include using your personal information to carry out a range of activities that ensure we comply with the requirements set out by our regulators (e.g. Financial Conduct Authority – FCA – and Prudential Regulation Authority – PRA) and in relevant legislation (e.g. Data Protection Legislation and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations).  We also disclose information to HMRC and other government bodies when we are required or permitted to do so.
How do we use your information in this way?
Sometimes, we’re required by law to produce reports or statistical modelling that we disclose to regulators or government bodies (e.g. when we need to report our complaints statistics to the FCA or liquidity modelling for Banking Authorities). To produce these reports, we may need to use profiling (where we categorise your behaviours, interactions and/or characteristics alongside other members and customers).  This helps us make sure that our reporting is accurate.
In certain circumstances, we’ll process your personal information in this way for our legitimate business interests. This is when we have legal obligations to process your information but flexibility in how we do this. For example: when data protection legislations govern that we need security controls in place to make sure your information is not disclosed to the wrong person. To comply with this obligation, we have stringent identification and verification processes in place when you open a product, together with numerous security controls (e.g. our authentication process to identify you when you use our products and services).
You have the right to object to us using your information for legitimate interests. Find out more about this in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
Enhancing your experience of our products and services
We're constantly looking to improve how we do things – and understanding more about you helps us do exactly that.
We collect and use your personal information to help us make our business better, improve products and services and enhance how we engage with members and customers. This includes:
Enhancing your experience in branch, online and on the phone, so we can provide the best possible service now and in the future.

Understanding our members' diverse backgrounds to help inform our strategy.
Planning and tailoring how we communicate and provide relevant content to you.
Developing our business and understanding how we're performing as a Building Society.
How do we use your information for this?
We look at you and how you engage with us (e.g. how long you've been a member or whether you open our emails), your transactions and how you use our products and services (e.g. the types of accounts you have and how you use our Internet Bank and Banking app). Sometimes, we'll collect information about you from organisations carrying out market research on our behalf to make sure you had a positive experience in our branch network or call centre, or to ask your opinion on our products and services, or trends in our industry.
Then, we structure and analyse this information to consider how you might use our products and services in the future. We may also use your information to categorise groups of members who interact and engage with us in similar ways.
We'll also use information we have collected from credit reference agencies and other organisations to profile your information (e.g. where we categorise behaviours, interactions and/or characteristics, both now and in the future). We'll do this whether or not you, or Nationwide, choose to proceed with the application.  This is part of what we call 'statistical modelling', helping us to review our risk appetite when making lending decisions.
Why do we use your information in this way?
We might use your information in this way when it is in our legitimate business interests. Your information and views help us understand the ever-changing needs of our members and customers, putting you at the heart of decisions we make about our products and services. By doing this, we can keep evolving what we offer and growing as a society.
Profiling your information alongside other members and customers also helps us to ensure that we're providing a consistent service and giving people the best products and advice at the right times. Read and download
full details on how we use profiling - PDF 49KB (opens in a new window)
.
We'll always make sure the way we process your information is safe and not unfair to you. Where possible, we'll keep your details anonymous and use your information only to produce statistical reports.
You have the right to object to us processing your information for our legitimate interests. You can find out more about this, and your other rights, in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
Testing and improving products, services and systems
We’re constantly looking to improve our products, services and systems. And, when it’s essential, we may use your personal information for testing so that we can make them even better.
How do we use your information in this way?
We have stringent processes in place to keep your personal information safe and we won’t use it in a way that’s unfair to you. When we use your information for testing, we:
Always do this in a secure and controlled environment.
Only use the minimum amount of data necessary for the testing.
Only use carefully selected specialist service providers, where necessary.
Only hold your information in this way for as long as needed to carry out testing.
Why do we use your information in this way?
Using your information for testing is necessary for our legitimate business interests as it allows us to maintain and improve the security, integrity and performance of our systems. Also, being able to develop systems with members in mind enhances the experiences you have with Nationwide.
You have the right to object to us processing your information in this way. For more details on this, and your other rights, take a look in the

To withdraw your consent
Where we are relying on your consent to process any of your information, you have a right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect any use we have made of the information before you withdrew your consent.
If you're a member and you’ve consented to marketing, you can
change your marketing preferences
at any time on the Internet Bank, Banking app, by post, phone or by popping into branch.
Updating your personal information
Why it's important to keep your personal information up to date
We need you to keep your personal details up-to-date so that we can get in touch with you about the account, product or service you have with us.
If you change your name, address, phone number or email address, please let us know straight away. You can
update your contact details
at any time in the Internet Bank.
Alternatively, you can call us on or pop in to your
local branch
.
Managing different addresses
We know that sometimes you might need to have certain accounts registered to different addresses.
To accommodate this, we’re able to hold:
Account level postal addresses. These addresses are typically used for individual account statements and communications to do with these accounts.
One customer level postal address. This is your primary postal address and is, typically, used to contact you about general communications that are not specific to a particular account. For example, marketing information and mail about your AGM voting or your Annual Savings Statement.
Important
If you let us know about a change of postal address, we will update all of your addresses unless you tell us otherwise, or unless our change of address process has asked you to tell us which accounts you want us to change your address on.
If you have recently taken out a mortgage with us, please make sure we have the most up-to-date postal address for any other accounts you hold with us.
If you’re unsure about the address we have on record for you,
get in touch
.
Your email addresses and phone number
We only hold one email address, one home number and one mobile number per customer and these apply to all accounts and policies you have with us.
If you change your email address or phone number at any time, the new contact details you provide will replace all existing ones. This includes when you open a new account or product with us.
Managing your contact details with our partners
If you’ve opened an account or a policy with one of our partners but through us (e.g. an investment or insurance product), and you notify us about a change to your contact details, we’d recommend getting in touch with them directly to confirm any changes. Likewise, if you have advised our insurance partners of a change to your contact details please get in touch with Nationwide to confirm any changes.
Other important information
Collecting ‘special category’ and sensitive personal information
From time to time, we may need to ask for personal details that might seem sensitive. For example, a question about your health or whether you have any previous criminal convictions. This is known as 'special category data' and covers information about your health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sexual orientation or biometric or genetic data.
We’ll only ask for this information when we absolutely need to, and we use it to:
Understand and accommodate any additional needs you might have. For example, if you could benefit from the services of our Specialist Support team to help with any issues around your health, memory, caring responsibilities or any challenges you're facing in life.
Understand any details about your health that we need to know for the purpose of insurance policies or investment products.
Provide you with products or services that you might wish to use biometric information for (e.g. your fingerprint for gaining access to our Banking app).
Detect and prevent financial crime. For example, when collecting special category data known as ‘behavioural biometrics’.
Carry out any searches, as part of regulatory obligations that require us to identify if someone has or might have a criminal conviction.

How do we collect your information in this way?
In almost all cases, we'll ask for your consent when collecting special category data. However, if you write to us or send a secure message (when signed into the Internet Bank) containing this type of information, then we'll assume that you're happy for us to record it – unless you tell us not to. If someone acting on your behalf provides this information, we'll record what's been provided and who gave it to us.
You have the right to withdraw your consent to us recording special category data at any time. Find out more about how to do this, and your other rights, in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section. This will not affect any use we have made of the information before you withdrew your consent.
Also, we collect and use behavioural biometrics for fraud prevention purposes. We don't ask for your consent when doing this, because it is in yours, Nationwide's and other banks and building societies' interests to use new technologies to support us in protecting everyone's economic well-being and stop financial crime. This data is not directly linked with your name or contact details, and it will never be used for any other purposes.
Automated decision making
At Nationwide, we sometimes use advanced technology to make automated decisions about our members and customers. This could be when you’re applying to open a product, service or account with us, or as part of our ongoing relationship.
When do we use automated decision making?
To assess your application and check if we can approve you for credit, to make sure that we’re lending responsibility.
To assess if we can offer you a financial product and work out the level of interest that you’ll pay. This helps us make sure that we’re fair and consistent in our product offerings.
To check if someone’s making a fraudulent application or if there’s activity on your account that needs further review. This is so we can protect your money and protect you from financial crime.
To decide if you are, or continue to be, eligible for the product or service you’ve chosen. For example, seeing if you’re eligible for a preferential interest rate on a savings product.
What information do we use to make these decisions?
For automated decision making, we use information that we’ve collected or hold about you from your applications. Sometimes,
we might also use information
from other sources such as credit reference or fraud prevention agencies – but we check this against the information you give us.
Profiling
Profiling is used to make automated decisions. This is where we combine your information with information about others so that we can:
Understand trends in traits and behaviours.
Make predictions about how you might use our products and services in the future.
Analyse data to improve our service and generate alerts (e.g. where we suspect that you may be the victim of financial crime).
Why do we use your information in this way?
We use automated decision making to check that we can enter into an agreement with you, and also carry out our legal and regulatory obligations. Sometimes, it’s required by law (e.g. when complying with UK money laundering regulations).
In certain circumstances, you have the right to ask for a decision to be reviewed by a person. For more information on this, take a look at the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.

Using your information when you’re not a Nationwide customer
From time to time, we might need to collect or use personal information from individuals who aren’t customers or members of Nationwide. This could be when they:
have a Power of Attorney or a third party mandate to act on a member’s behalf.
are the Personal Representative registering the death of a member or customer.
are acting as the guarantor on a member’s mortgage.
are acting as the donor for the deposit on a member’s mortgage.

are a child with an account opened on their behalf by an adult.
are paid money by a Nationwide member. We collect information so our member can confirm that the name they have matches the name on the account they wish to pay.
How do we collect or use this information?
In most cases, we’ll collect this information from the individuals directly. But there might be times when our members or customers provide their details (e.g. when our member is setting up a payment to the individual). If you’re providing information about another individual, we'll assume that you have told them that you are sharing their details and where they can find more information on how we may process their details.
These individuals also have certain rights regarding their personal information.  For more information on this, take a look at the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
Sending your information outside the UK
We may transfer personal information to countries outside the UK when:
You request for us to do so.
We’re required or permitted to by law.
We’re sharing data with a third party to support us in managing your account and running Nationwide.
When working with our suppliers and/or transferring information to countries outside the UK, we take appropriate steps to ensure that there is adequate protection in place and that data protection legislation is followed.
This could be by:
Ensuring that we transfer information to countries that we believe have comparable data protection legislation to the UK.
Putting suitable clauses in our contracts so that organisations take appropriate steps to comply with UK data protection law.
If you would like more information on this, please
contact us

When we use CCTV
For the safety of our customers and team members, we use CCTV (comprising static cameras and body-worn video (BMV)) throughout our branch network, data centres, admin centres and hubs. Where used, BMV will capture audio as well as video imagery. .
How do we use your personal information in this way?
When we collect your information using CCTV, we:
Only use carefully selected specialist service providers, where necessary.
Will only hold your information in this way for as long as is needed.
Will only share it in very limited circumstances, such as when we’re permitted or required to comply with a legal or statutory requirement e.g. from the Police or Department of Work and Pensions.
Why do we use your information for this?
Using CCTV in our branches, data centres, admin centres and hubs is necessary for our legitimate business interests. It helps us provide a safe and secure environment for people who visit us or carry out business in our premises. It also supports us in detecting and deterring any criminal activity.
You have the right to object to us processing your information in this way. For more details on this, and your other rights, take a look in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
section.
Unacceptable Behaviour
Nationwide defines Unacceptable Behaviour as any act in which a person is abused, threatened, intimidated, harassed or assaulted while doing their job.  Unacceptable Behaviour of any kind towards our staff, members or visitors to our branches won’t be tolerated.
In the event of any incident of Unacceptable Behaviour, we will use the personal data we hold to identify you and report the incident to our central team. This may include:
reviewing CCTV or body-warn video footage
identifying you through your account information, including your card details if you used an ATM machine
speaking to other members of staff to identify you
using the telephone number you used to call us to trace your member profile
collecting witness statements
What happens if a report is made?
The central team will assess the circumstances and severity of the incident and take appropriate action. This may include:
Monitoring your future interactions with our staff members
A written or verbal warning
Closing or restricting your accounts with us
Placing an alert on our internal systems
Making a report to the police or the appropriate statutory body, e.g., if we have a safeguarding concern
Provided there are no further incident of a similar nature, we will hold details of the Unacceptable Behaviour incident for a period of 6 years, after which the file will be deleted.
Why do we use your information for this?
Protecting our staff, members and any visitors to our branches is necessary for our legitimate business interests and to ensure that we are meeting our legal obligations to provide a safe and secure working environment.
Where we are relying on our legitimate business interests, you have the right to object to us processing your personal data in this way. You can find out more about this, and your other rights, in the
'What are your rights around personal information?'
