Information Obtained by Automated Means Through Our Services
We also may obtain certain information through our Services by automated means, such as cookies (including HTTP, HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of our Services. The information we obtain in this manner may include IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Services, and dates, times and locations you access or use the Services. In connection with our Services, we also may obtain your phone number and details about your mobile carrier.
A "cookie" is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web beacon" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain "clickstream data," which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored. We also may use similar automated means to obtain and store information regarding your actions while using our mobile apps.
We may link certain data elements obtained through automated means, such as your browser or device information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may have seen on our Services or on third-party websites and apps. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash
Website Storage Settings Panel
and
Global Storage Settings Panel
. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Services, and location services must be enabled through your mobile operating system for certain location-based elements of the Services to operate. Your device settings also may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with app developers of apps such as Checkout 51.
The Checkout 51 mobile app incorporates software from, and interacts with, Foursquare Labs, Inc. in order for the app to provide certain location services and exchange data with Foursquare for those users that enable location based services.  Users can elect at any time to turn off location services in connection with the Checkout 51 mobile app through your mobile operating system. Foursquare may collect and use information that may personally identify you, such as your device type, advertising identifier on your device, and device usage information (for example, a date/time stamp and your location when the App communicates with Foursquare). Such information is used to provide services to Checkout 51 and by Foursquare for internal purposes for its own benefit and may be shared by Foursquare with third parties if aggregated and anonymized.  All information collected by Foursquare may be used in accordance with Foursquare’s privacy policy (available at https://foursquare.com/legal/privacy), as updated from time to time.
In addition, if you register for the Services through or connect your Checkout 51 account to a third-party social media network or service (such as Google, Facebook or Twitter), we may obtain certain information about you from the relevant social media network or service, such as your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media network or service, the information contained in your public profile on the social media network and friends lists. The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media network or service.
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets, plug-ins and application programming interfaces (APIs) on our Services, such as social media sharing tools and location-based services, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with or use of these features. This information may be collected directly by the providers of those features or shared by us with such providers and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. Neptune is not responsible for those providers’ information practices.
How We Use the Information We Obtain
We may use the information collected from and about you to:
Provide our products and services, such as coupon delivery services and offers based on your location;
Create and manage online accounts;
Send promotional materials, alerts regarding available offers and other communications, including communications through the Services and outside of the Services, such as via mail, email and through third-party websites and apps;
Communicate about, and administer participation in, special events, promotions, programs, offers, surveys, contests and market research;
Respond to inquiries from you and other third-parties, including inquiries from law enforcement agencies;
Anonymize personal information to provide third parties with aggregated data reports showing anonymized information and other non-personal information;
Supplement your personal information collected from you with additional information from publicly and commercially available sources, and/or information from Neptune affiliates and our business partners;
Associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use for the purpose of providing relevant and easier access to content, advertising across browsers and devices, and other operational/business purposes;

We may use third-party analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, web server logs and similar technologies to help us analyze your use of the Services.

We engage third-party advertising networks to help us target our messaging to visitors through interest-based and contextual means. Through these ad networks , we can track your online activities over time and across third-party websites and apps by obtaining information through automated means, as described above. The networks use this information to show you advertisements on our Services or other third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may obtain on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites and use of apps that serve Neptune advertisements, such as the pages or ads you view and the actions you take on the websites or apps.

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.
Transfers of Information
The Services may be hosted in and managed from a country outside the country in which you initially provided the information, including the United States. We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to the United States and/or another country, which may not be deemed to have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When your personal information is in such countries, it may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in accordance with applicable law. If you are a user located outside the United States or the country to which your information may be transferred, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States and/or such country. Your consent includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above. When we transfer your information, we will protect that information as described in this Notice.
