All prices and discounts available on the Service may be withdrawn or revised at any time. While we strive for accuracy, there may be errors in the information displayed. The applicable price at the time of payment is the effective price. If the price is incorrect, we reserve the right to cancel your order and refund the amount paid, regardless of how the error occurred.
5.2. Goods. In-App Purchases grant you access to certain additional in-app content, including (a) special features to enhance performance and user experience, and (b) virtual diamonds that can be exchanged for other in-app features ("Goods").
