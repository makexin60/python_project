Welcome to Super Planet! We develop and publish games for mobile devices.
By clicking or tapping the button indicating the acceptance of these Terms, or by using the Game Services, you will be agreed to the processing of the Data (including Personal Information) with the terms of this Terms of Use Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, store, use, and disclose the information, including personal information, and data that our users provide or we collect in connection with any Super Planet games provided on a mobile platform. Additionally, this policy describes your rights and choices concerning your information. Please note that this private policy may be modified or be updated.
Information and Data We Collect from You
We collect information you choose to provide or give us in any manner. You don’t have to share information when we ask you for it, but if you decline, you might not be able to access certain Super Planet services, or take advantage of their full functionality.

We may obtain information from third parties to use along with the information we collect. We can receive information from third-party platforms (ex. Google Play, App Store, Facebook) if you download the Super Planet games or link your game account to your demanded platform.
We may partner with third parties such as payment gateway companies, platform service companies, and analytic companies to gather advertising and analytics information to help support our marketing initiatives, improve Super Planet services, and better manage our ad campaigns. We may share your Personal Information with these third party service providers so that they may provide their services to us.
If you don’t want to take advantage of the services that the third-party analytics and advertising companies provide on the Super Planet services, you may be able to opt-out of some of them by visiting

Instead, the ads you do receive won’t be interest-based any longer and therefore might be less relevant to your interests.

Please do not send any data about yourself, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
