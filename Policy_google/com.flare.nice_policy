        Photos you upload (including private photos) may reveal your identity and can be accessed by authorized users.
4. Information from Third Parties
We may also collect information from third-party sources, including linked accounts like Facebook, depending on
        your privacy settings on these platforms.
Use and Sharing of Information
1. Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We use Non-PII to personalize your experience, make your profile searchable, and deliver relevant ads. We may
        share Non-PII with third parties, including advertisers and consultants, for research and service improvement
        purposes.

Your credit card information is processed through third-party services (e.g., Apple iTunes or Google Play). In

Flare may display third-party advertisements. Clicking these ads may redirect you to other websites, which are
        not under our privacy control. We may also access certain information from social sites (like Facebook) based on
        your privacy settings on those platforms. We encourage you to review and adjust these settings as necessary.

We may disclose your PII if required by law, court order, or to protect the safety and property of our users or
        the public. This includes scenarios where you provide false information or impersonate someone else.
5. Sale or Merger
