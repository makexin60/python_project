Privacy Policy
Please note that the Privacy Policy was last revised on February 24, 2025
General
At Duolingo, we care about your personal information, so we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and share it. This Privacy Policy applies to Duolingo websites, mobile apps, and related services (“Service”). By using the Service, you agree with Duolingo’s collection, use, and sharing of your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Certain Duolingo services are subject to additional or different terms. For example, when you register for or take the Duolingo English Test, you are also subject to the
Supplemental Privacy Terms for the Duolingo English Test
.
Please note that Duolingo is constantly testing and improving our product features. Any features discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be available to all users or in all jurisdictions.
Information We Collect
When you use the Service, Duolingo may collect the following personal information about you.
a. Account Registration
To register for a Duolingo account, you may provide us with your age and email address. In some countries, you may also provide us with your phone number.
You may also register for a Duolingo account using certain social logins, such as Google and Facebook. If you register for Duolingo using a social login, Duolingo may receive information about you from your social login provider, including your email address and contacts.
You can manage your Duolingo account and social logins from your
Settings
.
b. Profile Page & User-Generated Content
After you register for your Duolingo account, a profile page will be created for you (“Profile”). Your Profile will be populated by information you submit, such as your name, username, bio, and profile picture (“User-Generated Content”). Your age, phone number, and email address are not included in your public Profile and are not considered User-Generated Content under this Privacy Policy. Other Duolingo users may be able to search for your Profile using your name, username, email address, or phone number.
Your Profile will also include information about your learning progress, such as the languages you are learning, your learning statistics, and your achievements. Moreover, your Profile will show a list of your followers and other users you follow.
By default, your Profile is public, and visible to other Duolingo users and anyone else on the Internet. In addition, your User-Generated Content may be publicly visible. If your Profile is public, third-party websites or web scrapers may be able to read, collect, and use your public information for their own purposes. However, you can set your Profile to private in your
Settings
.
You may be able to submit comments that will supplement other users’ Profiles and other users may be able to submit comments that will supplement your Profile. Any comments you submit are considered User-Generated Content under this Privacy Policy. You can delete comments you submit or comments that other users submit to your Profile.
Duolingo may scan or review any User-Generated Content, or share your User-Generated Content with a third-party content moderation service provider, to ensure compliance with our
Community Guidelines
. Duolingo may restrict or delete User-Generated Content if it violates our Community Guidelines or for any other reason.
c. Duolingo Max
If you subscribe to Duolingo Max, you may interact with Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) features, including Explain My Answer, which provides you with AI-powered feedback on your answers, and Roleplay, which allows you to send text or audio messages to an AI chat companion in an open-ended conversational format.
When you interact with AI features, your information may be shared with AI vendors such as OpenAI, which may keep a copy of your text or audio responses for their own purposes. Please do not submit any personal or confidential information when using AI features.
d. Speaking Activities
Some activities involve you speaking into the Duolingo app. To recognize speech, your audio may be sent to a third-party provider such as Google, Apple, or Amazon Web Services. Additionally, Duolingo may collect and analyze your speech to help us understand the effectiveness of our lessons and to improve the product. You may skip speaking activities.
Duolingo may also collect and analyze your speech to help us understand the effectiveness of our lessons and to improve the product. You may choose not to share your audio with us for product improvement purposes in your
Settings
. Any audio you agree to send to Duolingo is anonymized when it reaches our servers to ensure that no trace of your personal information remains attached to the audio.
e. Contact Sync Feature
Duolingo has a Contact Sync feature, which allows you to find your contacts who also use Duolingo. If you use Contact Sync, you will give the Duolingo app permission to access the contacts stored on your phone for the purpose of identifying your contacts who also use Duolingo. If Duolingo identifies a user with the same phone number as someone in your contacts, we will recommend that user as someone you may wish to follow.
If you use the Contact Sync feature, Duolingo will not store your contacts’ phone numbers, but only an encrypted “hash” of them. This hash is an alternative code to the actual phone number and can be used only to uniquely identify the number. The hashing process securely strips away the real phone number, so Duolingo cannot use the hashes to identify your contacts’ real phone number, contact your contacts, or share their information with anyone else. This hashing process applies only to your contacts’ phone numbers and not yours.
If you have submitted your phone number to Duolingo, whether through Contact Sync or some other way (such as adding the phone number to your profile, using it to register, or using it to activate other product features), other Duolingo users who have your phone number in their contacts may be able to locate your Profile using Contact Sync.
f. Activity Data & IP Addresses
When you use the Service, we may generate data about your use of the Service, which may include your browser and device data, log data, and IP address. We will also generate data regarding your engagement in educational activities on the Service.
We may recommend other Duolingo users for you to follow, and for other users to follow you, based on a shared IP address, such as other users on the same WiFi network. We may also use your IP address to display a location on your profile, which you may disable at any time. We will retain your IP address for no more than thirty (30) days, unless exceptional circumstances require longer retention.
g. FullStory
When you use Duolingo in our app or on our website, some of your activity will be logged by a service called FullStory. FullStory captures and analyzes your activity and provides us with data and a video session replay of your activity to help us make the Duolingo experience better. FullStory does not record usernames, names, profile images, email addresses, profile locations or bios, or passwords. However, FullStory records usage patterns (e.g., clicks, mouse movements, scrolling, and typing), tech specs (e.g., browser, device type, operating system, viewfinder size, script errors, and IP address), navigation (e.g., pages visited, referrers, URL parameters, and session duration), and learning activity (e.g., session progress and answers). You can disable FullStory activity recording by using the opt-out function on
FullStory’s website
. FullStory is disabled for known Child Users.
h. Cookies
When you access the Duolingo website, we store certain data from your browser using cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to data about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. If you do not want your data to be collected by cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature. However, cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features available on the website (e.g., customized information). You can find more information about cookies and how to manage them
here
.
You can see a list of all cookies used at Duolingo on our
Cookie List
page and manage your cookies in the
Privacy Preference Center
. Please note that our cookies include Targeting Cookies from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other companies, which these companies may use to track your activities across multiple websites to deliver personalized advertising to you.
i. Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with our website. Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions, as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our site. These reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google’s browser add-on available
here
.
How We Process Your Information
Duolingo may process your personal information according to the following legal bases: to provide products or services you request, to promote Duolingo’s legitimate interests, to comply with legal obligations, and with your consent. In particular, Duolingo may process and share your personal information in the following ways:
a. Providing and improving the Service
Duolingo will process your personal information to provide and improve the Service. For example, we will use the information you provide to maintain your Profile and learning progress, display your Profile to other users (unless you make it private), personalize learning content, detect and fix bugs, perform research, and provide customer service to you.
Duolingo may share personal information with third parties that help us provide or improve the Service, including hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services, search engine providers such as Google, analytics providers such as Crashlytics, support providers such as ZenDesk, and payment processors such as Stripe.

Duolingo may share personal information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to assist law enforcement, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents, or government agencies.
d. Personalized advertising
Duolingo may process and share your personal information for the purpose of providing you with personalized advertising. To provide personalized advertising, we work with a variety of third-party advertising networks, marketing analytics service providers, and website analysis firms, such as Google, Facebook, Oath, and Unity. These third-party advertising service providers collect and use personal information about your visits to and use of the Service, as well as other websites, in order to serve you with advertisements and content tailored to meet your preferences and likely interests, and better understand ad effectiveness. Aggregate demographic and interest data will also be used for market research purposes.
You can opt out of receiving personalized advertising in your
Settings
. You may also be able to opt out of receiving personalized ads from advertisers and ad networks that are members of the
Network Advertising Initiative
or who follow the
DAA Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising
using their respective opt-out tools hyperlinked above. In addition, your mobile devices may offer settings that let you make choices about the collection, use, and transfer of mobile app information for personalized ads (for example, Apple iOS’ Advertising ID and Google Android’s Advertising ID). Users in certain jurisdictions (including the European Union and United Kingdom) are opted out of personalized advertising by default, but may opt in.
Please note that opting out of personalized advertising does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you. Certain Duolingo subscriptions may offer an ad-free experience.
e. Anonymous information
Duolingo may process aggregated, de-identified, or otherwise anonymous or anonymized information for any purpose. Such information is not considered personal information.

You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority. Here is a list of
EEA Supervisory Authorities
, and a link to the
UK Supervisory Authority

Data Retention
Duolingo will generally retain your personal information until your account is deleted. However, Duolingo may retain certain information longer if necessary to provide our Service, defend our legitimate interests or those of third parties, comply with legal requirements, resolve or defend ourselves in disputes, investigate misuse or disruption of the Service, or perform agreements. We may also retain anonymous data indefinitely.
Child Users
We know that children deserve extra privacy protection. That’s why we treat Child Users (meaning users under the age of 13 in the United States or another age of digital consent in their country) differently to ensure their parents are in control and we only collect the bare minimum information we need to make Duolingo work.
Child Users are permitted to create a Duolingo account, but we ask them to provide their parent’s email address instead of their own, and to register using a username that is not tied to their real name.
After a Child User registers, we will send an email to the parent’s email address about Duolingo’s privacy practices regarding Child Users, including what personal information we collect and how we use, share, and protect that personal information. The email also explains how parents can request to access, change, or delete information about their child.
All Child Users receive the following special treatment when using Duolingo (“Age Restrictions”):
Lessons are made age-appropriate by removing mature words.
Advertisements are non-personalized and set to family-safe content.
Child Users cannot submit their real name or any pictures to their Profile, but are represented only by a letter avatar or cartoon avatar they can create from preset options.
The Contact Sync feature is disabled.
Promotional emails are disabled.
Child Users’ speech data is not shared with Duolingo for product improvement purposes.
Child Users in certain jurisdictions (including the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan) are subject to these additional Age Restrictions:
Child Users may not submit User-Generated Content to Duolingo.
Child Users may not provide Duolingo with their real name, profile picture, location, contact information, or other personal information.
Child Users cannot link their Duolingo account to their contact information or to their accounts on other online services.
Child Users’ Profiles contain no personal information that could be used to publicly identify or contact the child, but only the Child User’s username, an avatar created from preset options, list of friends on Duolingo, and information about their learning progress on Duolingo.
Child Users may join paid Duolingo Family Plans. If a Child User joins a paid Duolingo Family Plan, their profile will be visible to other members of the same Duolingo Family Plan.
We have activated limited social features for some Child Users. Child Users with these features active can only participate in social features on a limited basis as follows:
Child Users can only search for other users, or be searched for by other users, using an exact username or a referral link.
Your Child User may see other Child Users in friends suggestions, but only if the other Child User follows your Child User or has mutual followers with your Child User. Child Users will not see or be seen by non-Child Users in friends suggestions.
Child Users’ Profiles will be visible from their friends’ profiles.
Child Users can only send or receive canned “Kudos” to or from mutual followers; they cannot cannot send or receive user-written messages.
Child Users can participate in the “Friends Quest” feature with mutual followers.
You can block or unfollow other users on your Child User’s behalf.
You can disable social features for your Child User under
Settings
at any time.
Child Users will have access to leaderboards but will receive the following special treatment:
The Child User’s username will be anonymized to all other users in the leaderboard. For example, the Child User could appear as “John Smith” instead of their real username to other users.
Other leaderboard users will not be able to view the Child User’s Profile or follow the Child User from leaderboards.
Child Users will only see avatars instead of profile pictures in their leaderboard.
Child Users will see sanitized usernames on their leaderboard; usernames that have profane or obscene words will be replaced with a fake username for Child Users.
You can disable Leaderboards for your Child User under
Settings
in your child’s Profile at any time.
Parents may remove their child’s Age Restrictions. Additionally, parents can report any abuse to us at
abuse@duolingo.com
.
In addition, all users under the age of 16 receive the following special treatment:
Advertisements are set to non-personalised.
Third-party behavioral tracking is disabled.
Third-party analytics are disabled.
With regards to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, Duolingo collects personal information from children under the age of 13 for the sole purpose of performing internal operations of the Service. If we discover that we have unknowingly collected additional personal information from these children, we will delete it. If you believe this to be the case, please contact us at
privacy@duolingo.com
.
Duolingo ABC
Duolingo ABC is designed to be set up by parents and will ask you to provide your child’s age. This information is kept anonymously for research purposes and not tied to your or your child’s personal information in any way. Duolingo ABC does not collect any personal information from children.
You can choose whether to enable speaking exercises for your child on Duolingo ABC. Duolingo ABC speech data is stored on your phone and uses Apple’s speech recognition service to convert voice into text. No speech data is shared with Duolingo.
As a parent, you also have the option of providing your email address so that Duolingo may send you information about product updates and ask you about participating in product research. If you do provide your email address, you can unsubscribe any time by emailing
literacy-feedback@duolingo.com
or by clicking the unsubscribe link in any Duolingo ABC emails. Your Duolingo ABC data is backed up into Apple’s iCloud, which allows you to synchronize and restore the data onto another Apple device.
Duolingo for Schools
Duolingo for Schools allows learners to join virtual classrooms where fellow users act as teachers to manage their students’ accounts, assign XP targets and track assignment progress. If you give your email address to a teacher they may send you an invitation to their classroom. You’ll see the teacher’s name and their classroom name on the invitation. If you accept an invitation to join a classroom, teachers can see your name and email address, can reset your password, can send you login links, and can log in as you to help manage your account. Be sure to only join classrooms of teachers you know.
Teachers can email you learning assignments, and can see your learning progress, such as what languages you studied, how long you spent on a lesson and how many XP you earned. To remove all teacher control and their access to your data you can leave a classroom at any time by accessing the Duolingo for Schools section in your Settings in the app.

help center

The Service is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals sent by some browsers.

Duolingo is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites, including any personal or financial information collected by third-party payment processors.

www.duolingo.com/privacy
. When you register for or take the DET, you agree and will be subject to these DET Privacy Terms and the Duolingo Privacy Policy. To the extent there are any conflicts between the DET Privacy Terms and the Duolingo Privacy Policy, the DET Privacy Terms will take precedence with respect to the data of DET takers.
DET Data
When you take the DET, we may collect the following types of data from you (“DET Data”):
i. Information You Provide
When you register for the DET, you may provide us with personal information, including:
Your name
Your email address (or your parent’s email address)
Your age
Your date of birth
Your gender
Your native language
Your secondary school
A photograph of your current, valid driver’s license, passport, or other government-issued identification
A photograph of your face
Your payment transaction information (if you pay for the DET)
Additionally, you may voluntarily provide us with information for research purposes and to improve the DET, including your feedback and your test scores, score reports, or other data from other exams.
Testing Video
When you take the DET, you must provide access to your computer’s webcam and microphone. We will use them to record you and your screen during the entire examination period (“Testing Video”).
Your Answers
When you take the DET, you will submit answers to test questions (“Answers”). These Answers may include open-ended written responses, as well as recorded audio and video responses. Duolingo will record your Answers, including audio and video recordings.
The DET may include test questions that involve interacting with Artificial Intelligence (“AI”). Answers that you give to such questions may be shared with AI vendors for purposes of administering those test questions, but Duolingo’s agreements with AI vendors prohibit those vendors from using your Answers to train their own AI models or other purposes unrelated to the DET.
Please do not include any sensitive or confidential information in your Answers.
Biometric Information
When you take the DET, we may collect biometric information from you and extract biometric signals from your typing patterns, identification cards, photographs, and Testing Video, including your voice and face geometry (“Biometric Information”).
Duolingo will share your Biometric Information and other DET Data, including your identification cards, photographs, and Testing Video, with our identification verification vendor, Sum and Substance Ltd. d/b/a Sumsub (“Sumsub”), for purposes of identity verification and cheating prevention by Duolingo. Sumsub may extract biometric signals from this data, including your face geometry, and perform a liveness detection check on the same. Sumsub will process your personal data only for purposes defined by Duolingo relating to the DET. Sumsub will retain these signals and your other personal data following Duolingo instructions only for as long as needed to verify your identity and prevent future fraud or cheating, but no more than three (3) years in any event. You may review Sumsub’s Privacy Policy here:
https://sumsub.com/privacy-notice-service/
.
Duolingo and Sumsub may process your Biometric Information solely for the purpose of anti-fraud, preventing cheating and protecting the integrity of the DET, including sharing this data with third parties that are assisting Duolingo in protecting examination integrity.
Duolingo shall store any “biometric identifiers” as defined by the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) only for as long as needed to verify your identity and prevent future fraud or cheating, but no more than three (3) years in any event. Please note that writing samples and photographs are not considered “biometric identifiers” under BIPA. Duolingo shall store your other Biometric Information in accordance with the “DET Data Retention and Deletion” provision of these DET Privacy Terms.
By taking the DET, you expressly consent to the collection and processing of your Biometric Information as stated herein.
Computer Monitoring Data
When you take the DET, Duolingo will collect the following data about your computer usage while you take the DET (“Computer Monitoring Data”):
What additional applications or processes are running on your computer. Duolingo will not open any applications or individual files. Please close any other applications aside from the DET testing software by exiting them completely prior to starting your test.
What peripherals (external devices attached to your computer) are used during your test. Duolingo will not have control or access to these peripherals. Please remove any peripherals before testing if you do not wish to have their presence known.
Your network usage statistics and the volume of network traffic. Duolingo will not open network packets.
Duolingo may process your non-anonymized Computer Monitoring Data solely for the purpose of preventing cheating and protecting the integrity of the DET, including sharing this data with third parties that are assisting Duolingo in protecting examination integrity.
Duolingo may process anonymized Computer Monitoring Data for research purposes, including to validate and improve the examination and any anti-cheating systems.
Processing and Sharing DET Data
Duolingo may process your DET Data and share your DET Data with third parties for the following purposes:
To provide and verify accurate testing results
Duolingo may share your full name, date of birth, email address, photos you provide, test scores and subscores, a video of the interview section of your test, and your written responses to certain parts of the test (“Test Results”) with institutions seeking to evaluate your DET score, such as universities, government authorities, or other institutions that accept the DET.
You may share your Test Results with participating institutions through the DET website. However, Duolingo may limit such sharing if it determines in its sole discretion that the sharing would be abusive or has been requested for an improper purpose. If you registered for the DET with a voucher or coupon sponsored by an institution, that institution may receive your Test Results. Furthermore, institutions that have been approved by Duolingo to use the DET score verification system may use your Certificate ID and date of birth to verify your Test Results. Therefore, if you make public or share your Certificate ID and date of birth with a third party, approved institutions will be able to use that information to verify your Test Results.
If an institution requests additional DET Data for purposes of investigating cheating on the DET, Duolingo may share additional DET Data with that institution.
If you link your account or test results to an agent or counselor who is a member of the DET’s Global Counselor Network, Duolingo may share your DET Data with that agent or counselor.
Duolingo may also share your DET Data if required by law or government order.
To prevent cheating and protect examination integrity
Duolingo may use your DET Data, including Biometric Information and Computer Monitoring Data, to prevent cheating and protect examination integrity. For example, Duolingo may:
Use your identification, photograph, Testing Video, and Biometric Information to verify that the person who registered for the examination is the same person who took the examination.
Use your Testing Video and Computer Monitoring Data to validate that you took the examination without improper assistance.
Duolingo may share your DET Data with third parties as needed to prevent cheating and protect examination integrity.
For research and improving the DET
Duolingo may use your DET Data internally for research purposes, such as validating and improving the DET, and improving our ability to understand the spoken language.
Duolingo may process your DET Data as needed to create de-identified datasets for research.
Duolingo may share anonymized, pseudonymized, de-identified, or aggregated DET Data with third parties for research purposes. Duolingo may also share audio recordings of Answers with third parties for research purposes.
Restriction on Data Subject Rights for DET Data
Duolingo may reject or limit your request to exercise your data subject rights with respect to your DET Data if Duolingo determines, in its sole discretion, that the exercise of such rights would interfere with the integrity or administration of the DET. For example, we may refuse your access to DET Data that would leak test items, or to DET Data that is being used to investigate possible violations of DET rules.
DET Data Retention and Deletion
Your Test Results and DET Data will be deleted from your Duolingo account after seven (7) years have passed from the date you upload your test.
You may also request that your Test Results and DET Data be deleted. However, Duolingo may reject or limit your deletion request if your Test Results or DET Data are needed to protect the integrity or administration of the DET. For example, we may refuse to delete DET Data that is being used to investigate possible violations of DET rules.
Notwithstanding the above, Duolingo may keep anonymized, pseudonymized, de-identified, or aggregated DET Data and Test Results, as well as your Testing Video, indefinitely, to improve the examination, and for research and analysis.
Emails
Duolingo may provide you with emails relating to the DET or other Duolingo services, including for purposes of marketing and requesting feedback, at the email address you provide. Duolingo will not sell your email address to any third party.
Artificial Intelligence & Automated Decision-Making
Duolingo and its service providers may use partially or fully automated processes to score items, detect cheating and other rules violations, and protect the integrity of the Duolingo English Test. However, a human proctor will have the final decision to invalidate any exam.
Duolingo may use your DET Data and Answers for internal research purposes and to improve systems used for scoring and detecting cheating or other rules violations. However, Duolingo does not allow third parties to use DET Data and Answers to train AI models outside of Duolingo’s control.
Duolingo is committed to using AI for good, and we have established a set of Responsible AI Standards to guide our use of AI in connection with the DET. You may review our Responsible AI Standards at
https://go.duolingo.com/ResponsibleAI
and we welcome your feedback and comments on these standards at
