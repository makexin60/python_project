- User language set
- Operating system used
- Referrer URL
- Host name of the accessing client
- Time of server request
- IP address
There is no merge of this data with other data sources.
The basis for data processing is Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual measures.
Registration form and profile data
You must register for the use of the Boulder Challenge App to use the services offered. We only use the data entered for the purpose of using the respective offer or service. The mandatory information requested during registration must be given in full. Otherwise we will reject the registration.
For important changes, for example, in the scope of the offer or in case of technical changes, we use the email address given during registration to inform you in this way.
The processing of the data entered during registration takes place on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke your consent at any time. The deletion of your user account within the Boulder Challenge App is sufficient. The legality of the already completed data processing remains untouched by the revocation.
The data collected during registration will be stored by us as long as you are registered for the Boulder Challenge App and will be deleted afterwards. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.

We only collect, process and use personal data on the use of the Boulder Challenge App (usage data) insofar as this is necessary in order to enable or charge the user for the use of the service.
The collected customer data will be deleted after termination of the business relationship. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.
Submit contract for services and digital content
We transfer personal data to third parties only if this is necessary in the context of the contract.
A further transmission of the data does not take place or only if you have expressly consented to the transmission. A transfer of your data to third parties without explicit consent, such as for advertising purposes, does not occur.
The basis for data processing is Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO, which allows the processing of data for the performance of a contract or precontractual measures.
