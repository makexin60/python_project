Privacy Policy
At Bearbit Studios, we value your comments, suggestions and feedback. Our Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use and disclose “personal information” and other “non personal information” we have gathered about you.
What is Personal Information and why do we collect it from you?
‘Personal Information’ is information or an opinion that identifies you as an individual. We collect and store your email, where you nominate to specifically allow our games to collect your email. If you contact us directly for any reason, we may also keep a copy of that correspondence. Your email is collected only to keep you informed of new Bearbit Studios products and changes to our existing products.
Sensitive Information
Sensitive information is defined in the US Privacy Act (1974) to include information or opinion about such things as an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional body, criminal records or health information.
Bearbit Studios will not attempt to obtain nor record any sensitive information.
Disclosure of Personal Information
We will not sell, trade, rent or disclose any of the personal information you provide to us for any reason, without your prior consent. Otherwise, your Personal Information will only be disclosed where required or allowable by law.
