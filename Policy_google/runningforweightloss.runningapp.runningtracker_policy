Thank you for selecting Running App - Lose Weight App (referred to as “Service” or “Application”). We take the privacy and protection of your personal information very seriously. This policy outlines how we collect, utilize, and safeguard your information，and how you can control your information within the app.
It should be emphasized that this information is only stored locally on your device and we do not obtain any Personal data. Prior to using our App, we kindly ask you to thoroughly review this policy. By using our app, you agree and accept our privacy policy.
This Privacy Policy is applicable to the Running App - Lose Weight App Application provided by Leap Fitness Group (referred to as "We" or "Developer"). Throughout this policy, we will clarify the following:

Information Collection and Utilization
The Information You Provide
To make certain features function properly, some information and permissions are required. For example, you need to provide some basic information such as gender, height, weight and turn on physical activity permissions. These are designed to record your exercise data and give you a better idea of your training progress and calories burned. You can update this information at any time in our app settings to ensure your exercise records are more accurate. This information is only stored locally on your device, and we do not have access to it.
When you use our app, you can turn on notifications so you can easily track your daily steps and calories, and you can set exercise reminders. If you want to see your movement tracks on the map, you need to enable location permission so that our app can display your walking and running activity paths based on your location information. These are optional for you. If you choose not to turn on the relevant permissions, it will not affect the main functions of the app, but it may slightly reduce the quality of your experience.
All interactive actions within our app are referred to as "Your Activities," including your settings within the app (such as preferred language), your operation information and the time you spend in the app interface (which helps us improve the features you frequently visit). We use your activities to offer you more personalized services while continuously improving our app.
Feedback Information
You can improve your experience with the app by sending us feedback. Feedback information may include your usage data, such as app version, system version, screen size, country/region, app language, device, time zone, network status and whether you have subscribed. The decision to send feedback is entirely voluntary, and we regularly delete this feedback data, once a month.
The Way We Share the information
We do not collect any personal data, and we NEVER share the information you provide in our app with any third parties.
We may display personalized ads in our app to support and enhance our services. Currently, our advertising partner is Google, and for advertising, analysis, and fraud prevention purposes, Google may collect certain personal data, such as online identifiers and IP addresses.
Before collecting this data, Google will seek your consent.
Google is obligated not to disclose this information and not to use it for other purposes.
You can choose not to receive personalized ads. However, after doing so, you will still see ads, but the relevance of the ads to your interests and preferences will be reduced.
