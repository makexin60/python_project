you're eligible for our borrowing products;
we complete initial assessments for disputed transactions you raise through the app; and
our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.

Other Monzo Group companies
We may share details about you with other Monzo companies for reasons explained in the ‚ÄòOur reasons for using your information‚Äô section. We may share your details with people or companies if we change the structure of our group of companies, merge with another company, or get bought by another company.
How long we keep your information üìÅ
We‚Äôll keep your information for 6 years in case we need to respond to a legal claim. In some circumstances, like cases of anti-money laundering or fraud, we may keep data longer if we need to (that‚Äôs in our legitimate interest) and/or the law says we have to.
To work out how long we keep different categories of data, we consider why we hold it, how sensitive it is, how long the law says we need to keep it for, and what the risks are.

We need to use your data for our legitimate interest, or those of a third party. This means using data in a way that you might expect us to, for a reason which is in your and/or our (or a third party‚Äôs) interest and which doesn‚Äôt involve overriding your privacy rights.
Product development and marketing
We:
tell you about products and services through our app or other channels, like social media companies, based on how your use our products and services and other information we hold about you
may also exclude ads on this basis. We do this so we can make sure our marketing is useful. That includes instructing platforms to show or not show Monzo adverts to existing customers
share limited information about you with social media companies, other communication platforms, and analytics and search engineer providers
improve our products and services based on how you respond to ads we show you

Automated decisions & Artificial Intelligence
We sometimes make decisions without a human. We do this to decide if:
we can give you a Monzo account based on your age, residency, nationality, financial position and other circumstances, like the results of anti-money laundering and sanctions checks;
we can give you an arranged overdraft, loan, or offer you Monzo Flex based on information we hold about you, and information we get from credit reference agencies. This includes details on whether you've kept up-to-date with payments on any credit accounts, and if you've been to court;
we need to take action, like freezing a transaction or account because we suspect fraud or money-laundering against Monzo or a customer. We decide this based on patterns in our data, like an account or policy being used in a way that fraudsters work;
you're eligible for our borrowing products;
we complete initial assessments for disputed transactions you raise through the app; and
our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.
We'll tell you in the app once we've made these decisions. You can ask us to review a decision through in-app chat.
Who we share your data with ü§ù
Here we mean companies that help us provide services you use, and need to process details about you for this reason.
We share as little information as we can and encrypt and/or make it impossible for the recipient to identify you where possible (for example, by using a User ID rather than your name). These are:

analytical, Know Your Customer (KYC) and cyber security service providers that help us with identity verification or fraud checks;
cloud computing power, storage and software providers;
our business intelligence and analytics platform provider;

companies that help us with fraud prevention;

companies that print written statements and notices; and
companies that manage our CCTV and security if you visit our offices.

verify your identity and make sure what you've told us is true;
help detect and prevent fraud and money laundering;
assess whether you can afford to make repayments if you borrow;

Automated decisions & Artificial Intelligence
We sometimes make decisions without a human. We do this to decide if:
we need to take action, like freezing a transaction or account because we suspect fraud or money-laundering against Monzo or a customer. We decide this based on patterns in our data, like an account or policy being used in a way that fraudsters work;
we complete initial assessments for disputed transactions you raise; and
our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.
You can ask for a member of the team to review a decision by emailing us at the contact details above.

To work out how long we keep different categories of data, we consider why we hold it, how sensitive it is, how long the law says we need to keep it for, and what the risks are.

we complete initial assessments for disputed transactions you raise through the app; and
our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.

In this section we explain which lawful basis we rely on to use your special category data in a certain way.

Automated decisions & Artificial Intelligence
We sometimes make decisions without a human. We do this to decide if:
we need to take action, like freezing a transaction or account because we suspect fraud or money-laundering against Monzo or a customer. We decide this based on patterns in our data, like an account or policy being used in a way that fraudsters work;
we complete initial assessments for disputed transactions you raise; and
our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.
You can ask for a member of the team to review a decision by emailing us at the contact details above.

How long we keep your information üìÅ
