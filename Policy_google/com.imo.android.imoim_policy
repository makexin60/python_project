            of the ways that we may collect personal information include information that you provide us directly;
            information about you that we automatically collect from log data, IP addresses, and aggregated user data;
            cookies and similar technologies; information that you give us about your friends; and etc..
Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
Because we have a necessary and legitimate interest in doing so to provide the Service you have
                requested, or to comply with your instructions or other contractual obligations between you and us.
Because our legitimate interests, or those of a third-party recipient of your personal information, make
                the processing necessary, provided those interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental
                rights and freedoms.
To comply with our legal obligations as well as to keep records of our compliance processes.
Because you have chosen to publish or display your personal information on a public area of the Service.
Because it is necessary to protect your vital interests.
Because it is necessary in the public interest.
Because you have expressly given us your consent to process your personal information in a particular
                manner.
We do not use your personal information for making any automated decisions affecting or creating profiles
            other than as described herein. Please note that the examples below include types of personal data we may
            have concerning you, and not necessarily information that we have received about you.
i. Registration Information and Device Access Permissions
Registration Information.
This includes information you give us when you register an account. When you
            register for the Service, you provide us with your mobile phone number, which we use as your account
            identifier. You also have the option of providing your first and last name, and/or a username during
            registration of your profile. Some features of the Service (e.g. Public Service Account) only available to
            users in certain jurisdictions and may require additional information for registration such as your
            company’s certificate of incorporation.
Camera and Video Access Permissions.
This device access permission allows the Service to access your
            device’s camera and to otherwise capture images/video from the device, including photos stored on your
            device. If this access permission is granted, the Service can save photos and videos on your device and
            access photos and videos already stored on your device. Many features of our Service require us to collect
            images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to send or
            upload photos from your camera unless you have granted us permission to access your camera and photos.
Phone Access Permissions.
This device access permission allows the Service to access telephony
            features. It allows, for instance, read-only access to your mobile phone state, including the phone number
            of the device, the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any
            phone accounts registered on the device. This allows the Service to play audio and be muted when a phone
            call is incoming.
Address Book Access Permissions.
When you use the Service, you may grant us permission to collect
            contact information from your mobile address book in order to help us to connect you to your friends and
            other users on the Service. If you grant this device access permission to the Service, we will collect
            contact information from your device’s address book to connect you to your friends on the Service.
Speech Recognition.
This device access permission allows the Service to recognize spoken words in
            recorded or live audio, and we use it to recognize verbal commands and to handle text dictation. The speech
            recognition process involves capturing audio of the user’s voice and sending that data to servers for
            processing and analysis. Depending on your device’s operating system, these servers are operated by Apple or
            Android. The first time the Service requests authorization to use speech recognition, it will prompt you to
            accept or deny the request. The system records the user’s selection so that subsequent requests do not
            prompt the user again. This permission may be modified in the settings on your device.
iCloud Access.
This device access permission allows the iOS version of the Service to access your
            iCloud account and the files stored in your iCloud Drive. This device access permission enables you to share
            files via the Service from your iCloud account. This device access permission may be modified in the
            settings on your iOS mobile device.
Siri Integration.
This device access permission allows the iOS version of the Service to integrate
            with Siri. Siri allows you to command the Service with your voice such as opening the application and
            sending messages to your imo friends. The first time the Service requests authorization to integrate with
            Siri, it will prompt you to accept or deny the request. The system records the user’s selection so that
            subsequent requests do not prompt the user again. This device access permission may be modified in the
            settings on your iOS mobile device.
Push Notifications.
When you use the Service, you may grant us permission to send you push
            notifications on your device. You may at any time opt out of receiving these types of communications by
            changing the settings on your mobile device.

            combined with personally identifiable information, which shall be segregated from in a commercially
            reasonable manner intended to prevent re-identification.
For example, we may collect aggregate statistical information for audience and performance-related purposes,
            such as calculating the percentage of users who live in a particular region or determining which website or
            mobile application pages are visited most frequently.
How do we use Anonymous and Aggregated Data?
We use aggregated data from your data to build language models which help us improve the Service for
                your better experience.
We used aggregated data for research or statistical purpose to help us better understand our users’
                interests, to analyze trends, to improve the Service, and to customize the user experience.
ix. Special Categories of Personal Data
We do not intentionally collect any special categories of personal information about you. However, during
            your use of the Service, you may share certain special categories of personal data. Special categories of
            personal data include data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
            beliefs, or trade union membership; genetic data; biometric data; data concerning health; and data
            concerning your sex life or sexual orientation. If you publicly share special categories of personal
            information during your use of the Service, such as when you are exchanging messages with other users in
            public chats, using our live streaming feature, or when you upload that information on to your profile,
            etc., we will process such special categories of personal information in order to provide the Service,
            comply with your requests, and enforce our Terms of Service. If we collect special categories of personal
            information from you, we will obtain your affirmative consent before collection and will only process such
            information for the purposes for which it was collected and when permitted by law. If you do not consent to
            our processing of special categories of personal information, you must not use the Service. You should only
            share special categories of personal information with trusted sources while using the Service, and imo is
            not liable for any harm occurring as a result of your sharing such special categories of personal
            information with third parties via the Service.
4. Cookies
We use cookies and/or other similar technologies to distinguish you from other users of the Service and the
            distribution platform (App Store and Play Store) and to remember your preferences. This helps us to provide
            you with a good experience when you use the Service and also allows us to improve the Service. If you choose
            to disable cookies and/or similar technologies, some areas and features of our Service may not work
            properly.
You can read our

5. Information We Share with Third Parties
We will not share any of your personal data to any third parties except as explicitly provided in this Policy
            or where we have your consent or are permitted to do so by law. In particular, we may share your personal
            data with third parties in the following contexts:
Legal and Law Enforcement. We may disclose your personal data in response to subpoenas, warrants,
                    court orders or other legal process, or to comply with relevant laws or regulatory investigations
                    when we believe in good faith that applicable law requires it.
We may also share your personal data in order to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend
                    against a legal claim; and to investigate, prevent, enforce, or take other action regarding possible
                    illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to the safety of person or property, or a violation of
                    our Terms of Service or our other policies or agreements.
Employees, business affiliates, and intermediaries. We disclose your personal information to our
                    affiliates, subsidiaries, or divisions and their respective officers, directors, employees,
                    accountants, attorneys, and agents, or with our business partners, all of whom are bound by all of
                    the confidentiality and other data processing protections and practices described in this Policy,
                    use your information strictly to carry out their job duties on a need-to-know basis, and only do so
                    as required by law and as required by our legitimate interests.
Our Vendors. Our Service is developed and supported by third party vendors, who may, in the course of
                    performing such services for us (such as hosting, developing, or updating our Service), have access
                    to your personal information. Among other things, Service Providers may help us administer the
                    Service, support our provision of products and services requested by you, provide technical support,
                    send marketing and promotions to you, communicate with you about our products and services, assist
                    with payment processing and related issues, and assist with other legitimate purposes permitted by
                    law. We contractually require such vendors to maintain the confidentiality of your information and
                    to take appropriate measures to keep it secure. We prohibit such vendors from using or sharing your
                    information for any purpose other than in performing specific services for us required to maintain
                    and update our Service. Our vendors may periodically access our web server and/or employ analytics
                    technologies during the course of their work that may automatically collect and store the following
                    general information about you: the originating name of the domain from which you access the
                    Internet; the date and time you access the Services; the pages you visit; the Internet address of
                    the website from which you linked directly to the Service; and the type of device, device ID, and
                    browser you use to access the Service. This information is used to help us improve the Service by
                    tabulating statistics about your use of our Service (such as error incidence and origin of
                    referrers) that allow us to make them more useful to you.
We may also receive and disclose personal data about you from third parties who are bound to
                    obligations of confidentiality and are required to perform processing with us or on our behalf, for
                    as long as is required by their role and their contract or business relationship with us. The types
                    of personal data and third parties involved in these activities include: contact, financial, and
                    transaction data with providers of technical, payment and delivery services; usage data with service
                    providers who provide additional IT and system administration services; and business information and
                    transaction data with professional advisers including, but limited to, lawyers and accountants who
                    provide us with legal and accounting services.
Other imo users. We may disclose your personal data in response to your request to share photos,
                    videos, stories, or posts. For example, if you decide to share such content with “friends of
                    friends,” your posts will be shared with “friends of friends” and possibly other imo users depending
                    on reshares and likes. Stories are available in the Service for 24 hours. If you decide to use imo’s
                    live streaming feature, your live audio feed will be available to other imo users.
Unaffiliated third parties. We may ask if you would like us to share your personal information with
                    other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this Policy. We will only
                    disclose your personal information in this context with your specific and express consent.
Third Party Support. If you provide us with feedback, contact us for support, or ask us questions via
                    web form, telephone, email, or other method allowed by our Service, we will collect and may disclose
                    your name, email address, other contact information and other information to third parties as needed
                    to respond to your feedback, request for support, or answer your question.
Corporate Change. We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection
                    with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, without your
                    permission. In such an event, your personal information may among the assets transferred.
Aggregated Data. We disclose aggregated information about the Service and imo users to third parties
                    (including, without limitation, advertisers, media, and actual or potential partners or investors)
                    for informational purposes, new product development, marketing, and/or promotional purposes, without
                    seeking additional consent from you, when such aggregated information does not identify you or any
                    specific individual, as is the case with groupings of demographic data and customer preferences.
Advertisers. We allow third-party advertising partners to collect the advertising identifier and IP
                    address from your mobile device and to set tracking tools on your browser (e.g., cookies) in order
                    to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, the pages visited, and the
                    corresponding time of day). We also share de-identified information, as well as selected personal
                    information (e.g., device information, device identifier) we have collected, with third-party
                    advertising partners. These advertising partners use this information (and similar information
                    collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you
                    visit non-imo related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as
                    “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.” We may allow access to other data
                    collected by the Service to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant,
                    valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your personal
                    information with third-party advertising partners, you may opt out of such sharing by following the
                    instructions in Section 6 below. Third parties that provide advertising or other functionality on
                    our Service may collect the same information about your mobile device that we automatically collect,
                    as described above.
6. Opting Out of Receiving Communications
You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your personal information, as discussed
            below.
Emails and Text Messages.
We will only send you direct marketing communications by email or text if we
            have your consent or when permitted by law. If you decide that you do not want to receive marketing email
            from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future
            marketing emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.
In contrast, we also use email or in-app messaging to respond to customer service requests from you, to
            provide certain transaction-related communications regarding products or services you have requested, and to
            communicate certain non-promotional issues regarding imo and our Service (e.g., communications regarding
            updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy). You cannot opt out of these communications without
            deactivating your account, and you will continue to receive these communications from us even if you opt out
            of receiving marketing communications from us.
Push Notifications on Mobile devices.
imo may occasionally send you push notifications through our
            Service. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings
            on your mobile device.
Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers
            and devices. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain
            information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please
            note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
Interest-based advertising technologies.
As noted above, you may limit advertising tracking via
            advertising identifiers through your mobile device’s privacy settings. The online advertising industry also
            provides websites through which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our
            other advertising partners that participate in the self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also
            learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at

7. Rights of access, rectification, erasure, and restriction
Absent exceptional circumstances, we offer you reasonable access to and control over your personal data at
            any time, at no charge. Please inform yourself of your rights by reviewing the list below. You may use the
            “Contact Us” details at the end of this Policy to exercise your rights and choices.
For those users in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), we generally consider
            ourselves to be the “controller” of the “personal data” we collect and process, and we do so in compliance
            with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, 2016/679 (GDPR).
We try to respond to all legitimate requests regarding your personal information within one month.
            Occasionally, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have
            made a number of requests. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated. The timeframes described
            here do not apply to our response times for addressing ordinary customer service and support requests
            unrelated to the exercise of personal information access rights.
Although imo uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal
            information and to respond to their requests, there may be circumstances in which imo needs to ask you for
            more information in order to identify your account, and we may ask you to demonstrate your identity. If you
            cannot demonstrate your identity, imo may be unable to provide access. This may occur (a) when the
            information contains legal privilege; (b) when complying with the request would compromise others’ privacy
            or other legitimate rights; (c) when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to
            the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question; or (d) where the information is commercially
            proprietary. If imo determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide
            you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further
            inquiries. To protect your privacy, imo will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity
            before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.
Request of access.
You have the right to request a copy of the personal data that we hold about
                you, as well as to inquire about the origin, recipients, and purposes of that data. There are certain
                exceptions to this right, however, so we may deny access to you as required by law or to protect the
                legal rights of others. You can request a download of your account information in the Service. To
                request a download, navigate to the “Request Account Info” button inside the Settings section of the
                Service.
Request correction.
You have the right to request correction of the personal data that we hold
                about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data that we hold about you corrected,
                though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Our goal is to keep your
                personal information accurate, current, and complete. Please contact us if you believe that your
                information is not accurate or if your information changes. You may edit your account information via
                the Service.
Right to Erasure and Deletion of Your Personal Information.
You may have a legal right
(for
                instance, if you are located in the EU or EEA under the GDPR)
to request that we delete your personal
                information when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when, among
                other things, your personal information has been unlawfully processed. You may delete your entire imo
                account, by selecting the “Delete imo account” option in the settings. And you may otherwise invoke your
                right to erasure by contacting us at our email address indicated down below this policy. We also may
                decide to delete your personal information if we believe it is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our
                continued storage of your personal information is contrary to our legal obligations or business
                objectives. When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active servers and
                databases and our Service, but it may remain in our archives when it is not practical or possible to
                delete it. We may also retain your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations,
                to resolve disputes, or to enforce any agreements, such as limited information about your mobile device
                that may be retained for the purposes of fraud detection and enforcement of our Terms of Service.
Right to Object.
In certain circumstances, as permitted under applicable law, you have the right
                to object to processing of your personal information and to ask us to erase or restrict our use of your
                personal information. If you would like us to stop using your personal information, please contact us
                and we will let you know if are able to agree to your request.
Right to Portability.
You have the right to request that some of your personal data be provided
                to you or an authorized third party in a commonly-used, machine-readable format. You can request a
                download of your account information in the Service. To request a download, navigate to the “Request
                Account Info” button inside the Settings section of the Service. If you require the direct transfer of
                data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
Right to Withdraw Consent.
If you have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and
                transfer of your personal information, you have the right to fully or partially withdraw your consent.
                We attempt to comply with all reasonable and legitimate requests. As discussed above, you may modify the
                permissions and settings on your mobile device and the Service in order to limit access to certain
                information. To withdraw your consent with respect to emails and other communications from us, please
                notify us or follow the opt-out links available in the communications sent to you. Once we have received
                notice that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the
                purpose(s) to which you originally consented, unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further
                processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or
                defense of legal claims. Withdrawal of consent to receive marketing communications will not affect the
                processing of personal information for the provision of our Service. However, changing the permissions
                and settings on your mobile device or within the Service may cause certain features of the Service to
                stop functioning.
Updating Your Personal Information.
If any of the personal information you have provided to us
                changes, please let us know. For instance, if your email changes, you wish to cancel any request you
                have made of us, or if you become aware of inaccurate personal information about you, please contact us
                to update your information. You may edit your account information via the Service.
We are not responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete
            personal data that you provide to us.
8. Data Retention
We will retain your personal data for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected
            and to provide the Service to you. As a result, data retention periods may depend upon the feature of the
            Service for which the data was provided. However, we cannot guarantee that other users won’t record live
            feeds or other information you share with them, and another user may have a copy of information even if
            deleted by you and us.
We also will retain and use your personal data as long as necessary to comply with our business requirements
            and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to protect our assets, to provide our services, and to enforce
            our agreements. For example, we may collect aggregated data from your messages that is used to build
            language models which help us improve the Service. This data helps us to better understand our users’
            interests, analyze trends, and customize the user experience.
When we no longer have a purpose for retaining your personal data, we will use commercially reasonable
            efforts to securely destroy your personal data in accordance with applicable law and our policies.
9. Data Security
We maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent your personal information under our
            control from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized manner, altered or disclosed
            during collection, storage, and processing. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure,
            limited-access servers behind firewalls. Access to your account, personal data, and information is
            restricted within our organization to those employees and trusted partners that need access to your personal
            information in order to correspond with you and provide the products and/or services that you requested from
            us. Your personal data and information is also password-protected so that only you can log in to your
            account. Any additional safeguards used to protect personal information will depend on the sensitivity of
            the personal information; the amount, distribution and format of the information; and the method of storage.
While our security measures seek to protect your personal information in our possession, no security system
            is perfect and we cannot guarantee that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all
            circumstances or that any privacy settings or security measures used in connection with the Service cannot
            be circumvented. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to
            circumvent those measures or other safeguards in use, or access and/or use your personal information for
            improper purposes.
Most communications on our Service, including any submissions through available forms, are sent through the
            standard HTTP protocol and completed forms may be delivered using regular e-mail. Information sent over HTTP
            and email is not encrypted; and, while these are convenient communication mechanisms, use of these unsecure
            communication methods presents privacy and security risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of
            communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.). Any transmission of information that you make to us
            or through our Service is at your own risk.
The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where you use a password for access
            to restricted parts of the Service, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential. Do not share
            your password with anyone else. Restricted areas of the Service include social networking, chat room, or
            forum features. Please ensure that, when using these features, you do not submit any personal data that you
            do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.
If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice
            within the Service. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Service or systems that
            compromises your data, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are required to do so by
            applicable law.
10. International Transfer
Our company headquarters are located in California, United States.
We store and process your personal data
            and information on servers in
the United States,
Asia, and other countries outside
of the EU, EEA or
your
            home country. Be aware that your personal data and information is transferred to, stored in, and processed
            in these third countries which may not have the same adequate level of data protection as in your home
            country.
However, all transfers of personal data will be performed in accordance with the requirements of applicable
            law.
For example, we apply appropriate safeguards such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses for EU/EEA users’
            personal information.
If you do not agree to the transfer of personal data outside
of the EU/EEA or
your home country, you must not

3. Information We Collect and How We Use It
We must collect some of your personal information to provide, support, improve, and market the Service. Some
            of the ways that we may collect personal information include information that you provide us directly;
            information about you that we automatically collect from log data, IP addresses, and aggregated user data;
            cookies and similar technologies; information that you give us about your friends; and etc..
Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
Because we have a necessary and legitimate interest in doing so to provide the Service you have
                requested, or to comply with your instructions or other contractual obligations between you and us.
Because our legitimate interests, or those of a third-party recipient of your personal information, make
                the processing necessary, provided those interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental
                rights and freedoms.
To comply with our legal obligations as well as to keep records of our compliance processes.
Because you have chosen to publish or display your personal information on a public area of the Service.
Because it is necessary to protect your vital interests.
Because it is necessary in the public interest.
Because you have expressly given us your consent to process your personal information in a particular
                manner.
We do not use your personal information for making any automated decisions affecting or creating profiles
            other than as described herein. Please note that the examples below include types of personal data we may
            have concerning you, and not necessarily information that we have received about you.
i. Registration Information and Device Access Permissions
Registration Information.
This includes information you give us when you register an account. When you
            register for the Service, you provide us with your mobile phone number, which we use as your account
            identifier. You also have the option of providing your first and last name, and/or a username during
            registration of your profile. Some features of the Service (e.g. Public Service Account) only available to
            users in certain jurisdictions and may require additional information for registration such as your
            company’s certificate of incorporation.
Camera and Video Access Permissions.
This device access permission allows the Service to access your
            device’s camera and to otherwise capture images/video from the device, including photos stored on your
            device. If this access permission is granted, the Service can save photos and videos on your device and
            access photos and videos already stored on your device. Many features of our Service require us to collect
            images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to send or
            upload photos from your camera unless you have granted us permission to access your camera and photos.
Phone Access Permissions.
This device access permission allows the Service to access telephony
            features. It allows, for instance, read-only access to your mobile phone state, including the phone number
            of the device, the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any
            phone accounts registered on the device. This allows the Service to play audio and be muted when a phone
            call is incoming.
Address Book Access Permissions.
When you use the Service, you may grant us permission to collect
            contact information from your mobile address book in order to help us to connect you to your friends and
            other users on the Service. If you grant this device access permission to the Service, we will collect
            contact information from your device’s address book to connect you to your friends on the Service.
Speech Recognition.
This device access permission allows the Service to recognize spoken words in
            recorded or live audio, and we use it to recognize verbal commands and to handle text dictation. The speech
            recognition process involves capturing audio of the user’s voice and sending that data to servers for
            processing and analysis. Depending on your device’s operating system, these servers are operated by Apple or
            Android. The first time the Service requests authorization to use speech recognition, it will prompt you to
            accept or deny the request. The system records the user’s selection so that subsequent requests do not
            prompt the user again. This permission may be modified in the settings on your device.
iCloud Access.
This device access permission allows the iOS version of the Service to access your
            iCloud account and the files stored in your iCloud Drive. This device access permission enables you to share
            files via the Service from your iCloud account. This device access permission may be modified in the
            settings on your iOS mobile device.
Siri Integration.
This device access permission allows the iOS version of the Service to integrate
            with Siri. Siri allows you to command the Service with your voice such as opening the application and
            sending messages to your imo friends. The first time the Service requests authorization to integrate with
            Siri, it will prompt you to accept or deny the request. The system records the user’s selection so that
            subsequent requests do not prompt the user again. This device access permission may be modified in the
            settings on your iOS mobile device.
Push Notifications.
When you use the Service, you may grant us permission to send you push
            notifications on your device. You may at any time opt out of receiving these types of communications by
            changing the settings on your mobile device.
Contacts Access Permission.
To use the backup feature, we request access to your contacts. This allows us to include your contact information in the backup, ensuring you can quickly restore chat histories with your contacts. We'll only use this data with your consent and solely for backup purposes.
Google Account Access Permission.
When you choose to backup using your Google account, we require certain permissions to store your data securely in the cloud. This includes accessing your account details to verify your identity and protect your information from unauthorized access.
How do we use Registration Information and Device Access Permissions?

                services that may be of interest, including new content or Service, including tailoring content,
                advertisements, and offers, and to notify you of offers, products and services that may be of interest
                to you, for other purposes disclosed at the time that you provide your information, or otherwise with
                your consent.
To improve and personalize our Service and to target features that may be more relevant to you.

                your consent, or for which we have a legitimate interest.

            towers to which the device is connected or near. If you enable location services on your device, we also
            collect and store information about your location by (1) converting your IP address into rough geo-location
            data, and (2) accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location. You may opt-out of this
            collection by changing the settings in the Service or by changing the device access permissions on your

            data with third parties in the following contexts:
Legal and Law Enforcement. We may disclose your personal data in response to subpoenas, warrants,
                    court orders or other legal process, or to comply with relevant laws or regulatory investigations
                    when we believe in good faith that applicable law requires it.

                    against a legal claim; and to investigate, prevent, enforce, or take other action regarding possible

                    accountants, attorneys, and agents, or with our business partners, all of whom are bound by all of
                    the confidentiality and other data processing protections and practices described in this Policy,
                    use your information strictly to carry out their job duties on a need-to-know basis, and only do so
                    as required by law and as required by our legitimate interests.
Our Vendors. Our Service is developed and supported by third party vendors, who may, in the course of
                    performing such services for us (such as hosting, developing, or updating our Service), have access
                    to your personal information. Among other things, Service Providers may help us administer the
                    Service, support our provision of products and services requested by you, provide technical support,
                    send marketing and promotions to you, communicate with you about our products and services, assist
                    with payment processing and related issues, and assist with other legitimate purposes permitted by
                    law. We contractually require such vendors to maintain the confidentiality of your information and
                    to take appropriate measures to keep it secure. We prohibit such vendors from using or sharing your
                    information for any purpose other than in performing specific services for us required to maintain
                    and update our Service. Our vendors may periodically access our web server and/or employ analytics
                    technologies during the course of their work that may automatically collect and store the following
                    general information about you: the originating name of the domain from which you access the
                    Internet; the date and time you access the Services; the pages you visit; the Internet address of
                    the website from which you linked directly to the Service; and the type of device, device ID, and
                    browser you use to access the Service. This information is used to help us improve the Service by
                    tabulating statistics about your use of our Service (such as error incidence and origin of
                    referrers) that allow us to make them more useful to you.
We may also receive and disclose personal data about you from third parties who are bound to
                    obligations of confidentiality and are required to perform processing with us or on our behalf, for
                    as long as is required by their role and their contract or business relationship with us. The types
                    of personal data and third parties involved in these activities include: contact, financial, and
                    transaction data with providers of technical, payment and delivery services; usage data with service
                    providers who provide additional IT and system administration services; and business information and
                    transaction data with professional advisers including, but limited to, lawyers and accountants who
                    provide us with legal and accounting services.
Other imo users. We may disclose your personal data in response to your request to share photos,
                    videos, stories, or posts. For example, if you decide to share such content with “friends of
                    friends,” your posts will be shared with “friends of friends” and possibly other imo users depending
                    on reshares and likes. Stories are available in the Service for 24 hours. If you decide to use imo’s
                    live streaming feature, your live audio feed will be available to other imo users.
Unaffiliated third parties. We may ask if you would like us to share your personal information with
                    other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this Policy. We will only
                    disclose your personal information in this context with your specific and express consent.
Third Party Support. If you provide us with feedback, contact us for support, or ask us questions via
                    web form, telephone, email, or other method allowed by our Service, we will collect and may disclose
                    your name, email address, other contact information and other information to third parties as needed
                    to respond to your feedback, request for support, or answer your question.
Corporate Change. We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection
                    with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, without your
                    permission. In such an event, your personal information may among the assets transferred.
Aggregated Data. We disclose aggregated information about the Service and imo users to third parties
                    (including, without limitation, advertisers, media, and actual or potential partners or investors)
                    for informational purposes, new product development, marketing, and/or promotional purposes, without
                    seeking additional consent from you, when such aggregated information does not identify you or any
                    specific individual, as is the case with groupings of demographic data and customer preferences.
Advertisers. We allow third-party advertising partners to collect the advertising identifier and IP
                    address from your mobile device and to set tracking tools on your browser (e.g., cookies) in order
                    to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, the pages visited, and the
                    corresponding time of day). We also share de-identified information, as well as selected personal
                    information (e.g., device information, device identifier) we have collected, with third-party
                    advertising partners. These advertising partners use this information (and similar information
                    collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you
                    visit non-imo related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as
                    “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.” We may allow access to other data
                    collected by the Service to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant,
                    valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your personal
                    information with third-party advertising partners, you may opt out of such sharing by following the
                    instructions in Section 6 below. Third parties that provide advertising or other functionality on
                    our Service may collect the same information about your mobile device that we automatically collect,
                    as described above.
6. Opting Out of Receiving Communications
You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your personal information, as discussed
            below.
Emails and Text Messages.
We will only send you direct marketing communications by email or text if we
            have your consent or when permitted by law. If you decide that you do not want to receive marketing email
            from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future
            marketing emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.
In contrast, we also use email or in-app messaging to respond to customer service requests from you, to
            provide certain transaction-related communications regarding products or services you have requested, and to
            communicate certain non-promotional issues regarding imo and our Service (e.g., communications regarding
            updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy). You cannot opt out of these communications without
            deactivating your account, and you will continue to receive these communications from us even if you opt out
            of receiving marketing communications from us.
Push Notifications on Mobile devices.
imo may occasionally send you push notifications through our
            Service. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings
            on your mobile device.
Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers
            and devices. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain
            information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please
            note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
Interest-based advertising technologies.
As noted above, you may limit advertising tracking via
            advertising identifiers through your mobile device’s privacy settings. The online advertising industry also
            provides websites through which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our
            other advertising partners that participate in the self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also
            learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at

7. Rights of access, rectification, erasure, and restriction
Absent exceptional circumstances, we offer you reasonable access to and control over your personal data at
            any time, at no charge. Please inform yourself of your rights by reviewing the list below. You may use the
            “Contact Us” details at the end of this Policy to exercise your rights and choices.
For those users in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), we generally consider
            ourselves to be the “controller” of the “personal data” we collect and process, and we do so in compliance
            with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, 2016/679 (GDPR).
We try to respond to all legitimate requests regarding your personal information within one month.
            Occasionally, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have
            made a number of requests. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated. The timeframes described
            here do not apply to our response times for addressing ordinary customer service and support requests
            unrelated to the exercise of personal information access rights.
Although imo uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal
            information and to respond to their requests, there may be circumstances in which imo needs to ask you for
            more information in order to identify your account, and we may ask you to demonstrate your identity. If you
            cannot demonstrate your identity, imo may be unable to provide access. This may occur (a) when the
            information contains legal privilege; (b) when complying with the request would compromise others’ privacy
            or other legitimate rights; (c) when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to
            the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question; or (d) where the information is commercially
            proprietary. If imo determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide
            you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further
            inquiries. To protect your privacy, imo will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity
            before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.
Request of access.
You have the right to request a copy of the personal data that we hold about
                you, as well as to inquire about the origin, recipients, and purposes of that data. There are certain
                exceptions to this right, however, so we may deny access to you as required by law or to protect the
                legal rights of others. You can request a download of your account information in the Service. To
                request a download, navigate to the “Request Account Info” button inside the Settings section of the
                Service.
Request correction.
You have the right to request correction of the personal data that we hold
                about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data that we hold about you corrected,
                though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Our goal is to keep your
                personal information accurate, current, and complete. Please contact us if you believe that your
                information is not accurate or if your information changes. You may edit your account information via
                the Service.
Right to Erasure and Deletion of Your Personal Information.
You may have a legal right
(for
                instance, if you are located in the EU or EEA under the GDPR)
to request that we delete your personal
                information when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when, among
                other things, your personal information has been unlawfully processed. You may delete your entire imo
                account, by selecting the “Delete imo account” option in the settings. And you may otherwise invoke your
                right to erasure by contacting us at our email address indicated down below this policy. We also may
                decide to delete your personal information if we believe it is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our
                continued storage of your personal information is contrary to our legal obligations or business
                objectives. When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active servers and
                databases and our Service, but it may remain in our archives when it is not practical or possible to
                delete it. We may also retain your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations,
                to resolve disputes, or to enforce any agreements, such as limited information about your mobile device
                that may be retained for the purposes of fraud detection and enforcement of our Terms of Service.
Right to Object.
In certain circumstances, as permitted under applicable law, you have the right
                to object to processing of your personal information and to ask us to erase or restrict our use of your
                personal information. If you would like us to stop using your personal information, please contact us
                and we will let you know if are able to agree to your request.
Right to Portability.
You have the right to request that some of your personal data be provided
                to you or an authorized third party in a commonly-used, machine-readable format. You can request a
                download of your account information in the Service. To request a download, navigate to the “Request
                Account Info” button inside the Settings section of the Service. If you require the direct transfer of
                data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
Right to Withdraw Consent.
If you have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and
                transfer of your personal information, you have the right to fully or partially withdraw your consent.
                We attempt to comply with all reasonable and legitimate requests. As discussed above, you may modify the
                permissions and settings on your mobile device and the Service in order to limit access to certain
                information. To withdraw your consent with respect to emails and other communications from us, please
                notify us or follow the opt-out links available in the communications sent to you. Once we have received
                notice that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the
                purpose(s) to which you originally consented, unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further
                processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or
                defense of legal claims. Withdrawal of consent to receive marketing communications will not affect the
                processing of personal information for the provision of our Service. However, changing the permissions
                and settings on your mobile device or within the Service may cause certain features of the Service to
                stop functioning.
Updating Your Personal Information.
If any of the personal information you have provided to us
                changes, please let us know. For instance, if your email changes, you wish to cancel any request you
                have made of us, or if you become aware of inaccurate personal information about you, please contact us
                to update your information. You may edit your account information via the Service.
We are not responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete
            personal data that you provide to us.
8. Data Retention
We will retain your personal data for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected
            and to provide the Service to you. As a result, data retention periods may depend upon the feature of the
            Service for which the data was provided. However, we cannot guarantee that other users won’t record live
            feeds or other information you share with them, and another user may have a copy of information even if
            deleted by you and us.
We also will retain and use your personal data as long as necessary to comply with our business requirements
            and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to protect our assets, to provide our services, and to enforce

            limited-access servers behind firewalls. Access to your account, personal data, and information is
            restricted within our organization to those employees and trusted partners that need access to your personal
            information in order to correspond with you and provide the products and/or services that you requested from
            us. Your personal data and information is also password-protected so that only you can log in to your
            account. Any additional safeguards used to protect personal information will depend on the sensitivity of
            the personal information; the amount, distribution and format of the information; and the method of storage.
While our security measures seek to protect your personal information in our possession, no security system
            is perfect and we cannot guarantee that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all
            circumstances or that any privacy settings or security measures used in connection with the Service cannot
            be circumvented. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to
            circumvent those measures or other safeguards in use, or access and/or use your personal information for
            improper purposes.
Most communications on our Service, including any submissions through available forms, are sent through the
            standard HTTP protocol and completed forms may be delivered using regular e-mail. Information sent over HTTP
            and email is not encrypted; and, while these are convenient communication mechanisms, use of these unsecure
            communication methods presents privacy and security risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of
            communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.). Any transmission of information that you make to us
            or through our Service is at your own risk.
The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where you use a password for access
            to restricted parts of the Service, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential. Do not share
            your password with anyone else. Restricted areas of the Service include social networking, chat room, or
            forum features. Please ensure that, when using these features, you do not submit any personal data that you
            do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.
If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice
            within the Service. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Service or systems that
            compromises your data, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are required to do so by
            applicable law.
10. International Transfer
Our company headquarters are located in California, United States.
We store and process your personal data
            and information on servers in
the United States,
Asia, and other countries outside
of the EU, EEA or
your
            home country. Be aware that your personal data and information is transferred to, stored in, and processed
            in these third countries which may not have the same adequate level of data protection as in your home
            country.
However, all transfers of personal data will be performed in accordance with the requirements of applicable
            law.
For example, we apply appropriate safeguards such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses for EU/EEA users’
            personal information.
If you do not agree to the transfer of personal data outside
of the EU/EEA or
your home country, you must not
            use the Service.
While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States and other jurisdictions might not be
            as comprehensive as those in your country, we take steps to protect the security and privacy of your
            personal information as set forth above.
11. Children’s Privacy
The Service is not directed to and imo does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years of age (or such greater age required in your country or territory for you to register for and use our Services without parental approval). If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information
            without your consent, you may delete your child’s entire account, by selecting the “Delete imo account”
            option in your child’s imo app settings or report to us at privacy@imo.im (for more details, you may check Section 11 of our Terms of Service). If we learn that we have collected
            any personal information from a child, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate
            the child’s account. This section supersedes any age limitations that may be listed in connection with the
            ratings listed in an application store.
12. Redress and Accountability
If you have any questions about our privacy practices or this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at
            privacy@imo.im or via the methods listed below. We will address your concerns and attempt to resolve any
            privacy issues in a timely manner.
13. Changes to our Privacy Policy

            Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post the new Policy on this

            Policy, please stop using our Service.

Our Vendors. Our Service is developed and supported by third party vendors, who may, in the course of performing such services for us (such as hosting, developing, or updating our Service), have access to your personal information. Among other things, Service Providers may help us administer the Service, support our provision of products and services requested by you, provide technical support, send marketing and promotions to you, communicate with you about our products and services, assist with payment processing and related issues, and assist with other legitimate purposes permitted by law.

6. Opting Out of Receiving Communications
You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your personal information, as discussed below.

If you decide that you do not want to receive marketing email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future marketing emails.  We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.

Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
Interest-based advertising technologies.
As noted above, you may limit advertising tracking via advertising identifiers through your mobile device’s privacy settings.  The online advertising industry also provides websites through which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in the self-regulatory programs.

7. Rights of access, rectification, erasure, and restriction
Absent exceptional circumstances, we offer you reasonable access to and control over your personal data at any time, at no charge. Please inform yourself of your rights by reviewing the list below. You may use the “Contact Us” details at the end of this Policy to exercise your rights and choices.
For those users in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), we generally consider ourselves to be the “controller” of the “personal data” we collect and process, and we do so in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, 2016/679 (GDPR).
We try to respond to all legitimate requests regarding your personal information within one month. Occasionally, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated. The timeframes described here do not apply to our response times for addressing ordinary customer service and support requests unrelated to the exercise of personal information access rights.
Although imo uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal information and to respond to their requests, there may be circumstances in which imo needs to ask you for more information in order to identify your account, and we may ask you to demonstrate your identity. If you cannot demonstrate your identity, imo may be unable to provide access. This may occur (a) when the information contains legal privilege; (b) when complying with the request would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights; (c) when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question; or (d) where the information is commercially proprietary. If imo determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, imo will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.
Request of access.
You have the right to request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you, as well as to inquire about the origin, recipients, and purposes of that data. There are certain exceptions to this right, however, so we may deny access to you as required by law or to protect the legal rights of others. You can request a download of your account information in the Service. To request a download, navigate to the “Request Account Info” button inside the Settings section of the Service.
Request correction.
You have the right to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data that we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Our goal is to keep your personal information accurate, current, and complete.  Please contact us  if you believe that your information is not accurate or if your information changes.  You may edit your account information via the Service.
Right to Erasure and Deletion of Your Personal Information.
You may have a legal right (for instance, if you are located in the EU or EEA under the GDPR) to request that we delete your personal information when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when, among other things, your personal information has been unlawfully processed.  You may delete your chat history stored on imo’s servers, for any reason, by selecting the “Delete chat history” option in the settings of the Service. You may delete your entire imo account, by selecting the “Delete imo account” option in the settings. We also may decide to delete your personal information if we believe it is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our continued storage of your personal information is contrary to our legal obligations or business objectives.  When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active servers and databases and our Service, but it may remain in our archives when it is not practical or possible to delete it.  We may also retain your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, or to enforce any agreements, such as limited information about your mobile device that may be retained for the purposes of fraud detection and enforcement of our Terms of Service.
Right to Object.
In certain circumstances, as permitted under applicable law, you have the right to object to processing of your personal information and to ask us to erase or restrict our use of your personal information.  If you would like us to stop using your personal information, please contact us  and we will let you know if are able to agree to your request.
Right to Portability.
You have the right to request that some of your personal data be provided to you or an authorized third party in a commonly-used, machine-readable format. You can request a download of your account information in the Service. To request a download, navigate to the “Request Account Info” button inside the Settings section of the Service.  If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
Right to Withdraw Consent.
If you have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and transfer of your personal information, you have the right to fully or partially withdraw your consent. We attempt to comply with all reasonable and legitimate requests.  As discussed above, you may modify the permissions and settings on your mobile device and the Service in order to limit access to certain information. To withdraw your consent with respect to emails and other communications from us, please notify us or follow the opt-out links available in the communications sent to you.  Once we have received notice that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented, unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.  Withdrawal of consent to receive marketing communications will not affect the processing of personal information for the provision of our Service.  However, changing the permissions and settings on your mobile device or within the Service may cause certain features of the Service to stop functioning.
Updating Your Personal Information.
If any of the personal information you have provided to us changes, please let us know.  For instance, if your email changes, you wish to cancel any request you have made of us, or if you become aware of inaccurate personal information about you, please contact us to update your information.  You may edit your account information via the Service.
We are not responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete personal data that you provide to us.
8. Data Retention
We will retain your personal data for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to provide the Service to you.  As a result, data retention periods may depend upon the feature of the Service for which the data was provided.
We also will retain and use your personal data as long as necessary to comply with our business requirements and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to protect our assets, to provide our services, and to enforce our agreements.  For example, we may collect aggregated data from your chat history that is used to build language models which help us improve the Service. This data helps us to better understand our users’ interests, analyze trends, and customize the user experience.
When we no longer have a purpose for retaining your personal data, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to securely destroy your personal data in accordance with applicable law and our policies.
9. Data Destruction
Personal information, which has fulfilled the purpose for which it was collected or used, and has reached the period of time during which personal information was to be possessed, will be destroyed in an irreversible way. Personal information stored in electronic files will be automatically deleted in an irreversible way by using technical methods, and printed information will be destroyed by shredding or incinerating such information.
10. Data Security
We maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent your personal information under our control from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized manner, altered or disclosed during collection, storage, and processing.  All information you provide to us is stored on our secure, limited-access servers behind firewalls. Access to your account, personal data, and information is restricted within our organization to those employees and trusted partners that need access to your personal information in order to correspond with you and provide the products and/or services that you requested from us.  Your personal data and information is also password-protected so that only you can log in to your account.  Any additional safeguards used to protect personal information will depend on the sensitivity of the personal information; the amount, distribution and format of the information; and the method of storage.
While our security measures seek to protect your personal information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot guarantee that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances or that any privacy settings or security measures used in connection with the Service cannot be circumvented.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to circumvent those measures or other safeguards in use, or access and/or use your personal information for improper purposes.
Most communications on our Service, including any submissions through available forms, are sent through the standard HTTP protocol and completed forms may be delivered using regular e-mail.  Information sent over HTTP and email is not encrypted; and, while these are convenient communication mechanisms, use of these unsecure communication methods presents privacy and security risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.).  Any transmission of information that you make to us or through our Service is at your own risk.
The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where you use a password for access to restricted parts of the Service, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential.  Do not share your password with anyone else.  Restricted areas of the Service include social networking, chat room, or forum features. Please ensure that, when using these features, you do not submit any personal data that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.
If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice within the Service. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Service or systems that compromises your data, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are required to do so by applicable law.
11. International Transfer
Our company headquarters are located in California, United States. We store and process your personal data and information on servers in the United States, Asia, and other countries outside of the EU, EEA or your home country. Be aware that your personal data and information is transferred to, stored in, and processed in these third countries which may not have the same adequate level of data protection as in your home country. However, all transfers of personal data will be performed in accordance with the requirements of applicable law. For example, we apply appropriate safeguards such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses for EU/EEA users’ personal information.
You may contact us at privacy@imo.im if you do not agree to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU/EEA or your home country. However, if you refuse such transfer, you may not be able to access to part of our Service to the extent such transfer is a must.
While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States and other jurisdictions might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take steps to protect the security and privacy of your personal information as set forth above.
Specifically, we might transfer your personal data to third parties overseas as follows:
