SCATT Electronics LLC built the SCATT Expert app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by SCATT Electronics LLC at no cost and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
Information Collection and Use
We do not collect your data, we do not track you, and we do not profile you. All your data is stored locally on your device. The app is not communicating with our server and we do not have a server database to store it.
The app will record and store your profile name and training data locally on your device. This data will not be sent to us or any third party. Unless you send your practice file manually to someone, all your data will stay on your device.
Service Providers and Analytics
We do not employ third-party companies and individuals to process your data, so no data is shared with vendors or analytics providers.
