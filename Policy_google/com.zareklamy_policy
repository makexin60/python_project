Access the personal information we collect about you, including the categories of data collected, purposes of use, and any third parties with whom it is shared.

Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information – Notice of Right to Opt-Out
NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS REGARDING OPT-OUT RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT (CCPA)
Welcome to Paidwork’s quick start information guide on how to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Paidwork recognizes that there are many different users of Paidwork – game players, developers, etc. This page provides important notices and directions for different users to exercise their rights under the CCPA. For more information on Paidwork’s view of data collecting and use practices, please view Paidwork’s
Privacy Policy.

to learn about your rights.

Does Paidwork actually “sell” or “share” personal information?
Paidwork does not, and will not, provide your personal information in direct exchange for money. Therefore, in the literal sense, Paidwork does not sell your information. However, the CCPA requires Paidwork to disclose if it sells personal information, and, under the CCPA’s expansive definition of “sell”, certain advertising and analytics activities may constitute a CCPA sale of information. In addition, Paidwork “shares” personal information, which the CCPA defines as providing information for the purposes of “cross-context behavioral advertising.” The following activities may constitute “selling” and “sharing” under the CCPA:
Paidwork Ads
Many games include advertisements. When you play a game that utilizes Paidwork’s Ad Network, the device you are using sends an advertising identifier (called an “Ad ID”) to Paidwork. Under the CCPA, this Ad ID is considered personal information. Why? Because it may include information on you such as your location, the device you are using, and some of the activities you’ve completed in your game. Please see Paidwork’s
Privacy Policy
for the full details on the types of information Paidwork collects and how Paidwork uses and discloses such information.
Paidwork shares the Ad ID with our advertising and publishing partners and sometimes our partners may use this Ad ID to look up information about you. This may include things like your online activities, purchases you’ve made or websites you’ve visited. This is all done to personalize future advertisements you may see. In fact, the whole point is to give the advertiser an opportunity to advertise to you – and specifically to you – with a personalized ad. For this reason, under CCPA, providing the Ad ID constitutes “sharing” under the CCPA and may be a “sale” of personal information.
If you do not see these options, the developer of the game you are playing has enabled controls to create a more privacy-protective experience or to indicate to Paidwork that the game is directed to children under the age of 13. As a result, in such games, we deliver ads to you based only on contextual data (e.g., the game you are playing), which does not constitute “sharing” or a “sale” under the CCPA.
Paidwork Analytics
If you are playing a game that uses Paidwork Analytics, then Paidwork collects personal information about you. While this is controlled on the publisher side, you have the ability to opt out of such collection. Paidwork does not believe the usage of analytics by a game developer is a “sale” of personal information, but this could be considered “sharing” under the CCPA, so we have offered the opportunity to opt-out of this service. To access your privacy settings, look for your privacy information and account services (each location will be different in each game), and, if you have trouble finding them, contact the game developer. Once you begin to exercise your privacy rights within a game, you will be pushed into a Paidwork web flow that will guide you through the process.
Website Cookies
The other activity that may constitute “selling” and/or “sharing” personal information involves cookies. Paidwork sets cookies when you visit our website, and some may be shared with certain third-party marketing partners in order for us to reach you with offers. You can get full information in our Cookie Policy here.
Ok, if I’m a game player, under CCPA, what rights do I have?
When you play a game that utilizes Paidwork’s Ad Network, the device you are using sends an advertising identifier (called an “Ad ID”) to Paidwork, which is used to personalize future ads to you. As a game player, you have the right to opt out from personalized ads (which may involve the “sale” and/or “sharing” of your personal information under the CCPA), request the deletion or correction of certain personal information, and/or request a disclosure of your personal information from Paidwork. In general, Paidwork does not have enough information about you as an individual to locate your records or verify your identity through an email or mailed request. Therefore, we have created an alternative way for you to authenticate yourself for a CCPA disclosure when you are inside of a game. You may also exercise your opt-out rights inside a game without going through the formal verification.
Please note if you do not see opt-out options in your app, your game developer has enabled controls to create a more privacy-protective experience or to indicate to Paidwork that the app is directed to children under the age of 13. When this is done, we deliver ads to you based on contextual data (e.g., the game you are playing), which does not constitute “sharing” or a “sale” under the CCPA .
How do I exercise my rights?
To exercise your opt-out rights under CCPA, you can start by clicking on the privacy settings banner or by clicking on the privacy icon in the left bottom corner of a personalized Paidwork ad. The icon looks like this:
Privacy
Once you click on this icon, you will be guided through a series of steps to make your opt-out choices and set your cookies as you prefer.
You can opt-out of personalized ads inside of the game you are playing, or, if you provide your preferred email and go through verification inside the ad, you can get a link to order a data disclosure report or opt-out of personalized ads for the game you are playing at that time. We will not use your email for any purpose other than helping you exercise your privacy rights.
To exercise any of the other rights stated above or for inquiries, please send a message to the privacy team at support@paidwork.com.
I am just visiting the Paidwork website. What rights do I have?
To opt-out of our “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information, click on the “Your Privacy Choices (Cookie Settings)” link in the website footer and select your options in the pop-up. We do not have a way yet to authenticate website visitors for disclosures of personal information. We will continue to review this from time to time and update this notice if we create a way to do this. We encourage you to visit the privacy pages of our third party partners listed in our Cookie Policy to determine if they have an ability to provide you with a disclosure of the personal information they collect about you.
