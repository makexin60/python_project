How do I file a complaint?
File a filled-out and notarized complaint assisted form6 or a verified complain together with copies of any evidence and
witnesses’ affidavit through the following:
Personally;
By registered mail;
By courier; or
By electronic mail as may be
authorized by the Commission.
Electronic documents must be digitally signed and in .PDF format (if practicable), on
page sizes compliant with the Efficient Use of Paper Rule. If submitted in this digital format, the NPC may charge fees for printing.

If submitting through a portable electronic data storage device (ex. CD’s, Thumb Drives, etc.), similar portable data storage devices containing the same files must also be given to any opposing party so named. One portable data storage device is equivalent to one copy. If the portable data storage device is infected with malware, the documents will not be considered as having been filed.
Paano ako magsasampa ng reklamo?
Maghain ng napunan at notaryadong
complaint-assisted form o isang verified

complaint kasama ng mga kopya ng
anumang ebidensya at salaysay ng mga
testigo sa pamamagitan ng sumusunod:
Personal na pagpunta sa opisina ng NPC;
Sa pamamagitan ng registered mail, sa post office;
Sa pamamagitan ng courier (kagaya ng LBC, 2Go, at iba pa); o
Sa pamamagitan ng email na pinahihintulutan ng NPC.
Ang mga elektronikong dokumento ay
dapat na digital na nilagdaan at nasa .PDF na
format (kung magagawa), at ang mga pahina
ay sumusunod sa Efficient Use of Paper Rule.
Kung isinumite sa digital format, maaaring
maningil ang NPC ng bayad para sa pag print ng mga ito.

Kung nagsumite sa pamamagitan ng portable
na electronic data storage device (halimbawa
CD, Thumb Drives, at iba pa), ang mga
katulad na portable data storage device na
naglalaman ng mga file ay dapat ding ibigay
sa kabilang partido na pinangalanan sa
reklamo. Ang isang portable data storage
device ay katumbas ng isang kopya. Kung
ang portable data storage device ay nahawaan
ng malware, ang mga dokumento ay hindi
ituturing na nai-file.
IMPORTANT REMINDERS
Exhaustion of Remedies
Those who wish to file a complaint must
comply with the exhaustion of remedies.
This means that in filing the complaint, the
complainant has informed, in writing the
respondent of the privacy violation or
personal data breach to allow respondent to
address the same and the respondent did not
take timely or appropriate action, or there is no response within fifteen (15) calendar days
from receipt of written information from the
complainant.

Proof of this must be attached to the
complaint.
Attachment of Evidence
Complaints that are not sufficient in form
and in substance may cause the outright
dismissal of the complaint.12 To avoid this,
complaints filed before the NPC must
comply with the form and contents specified
in the NPC Rules of Procedure.

Further, complaints must be accompanied
by supporting documents and affidavits as
evidence.

Complaints with insufficient evidence may
be dismissed outright.
MAHALAGANG PAALALA:
Exhaustion of Remedies
Ang mga nais magsampa ng reklamo ay
dapat sumunod sa
exhaustion of remedies.
Nangangahulugan ito na sa paghahain ng
reklamo, ipinaalam ng nagrereklamo, sa
pamamagitan ng pagsulat sa
respondent
ng
paglabag sa
privacy
o
personal data breach
upang bigyan ng pagkakataon ang
respondent
na tugunan ang reklamo at kung
ang
respondent
ay hindi gumawa ng
napapanahon o naaangkop na aksyon, o
walang tugon sa loob ng labinlimang (15)
araw mula sa pagtanggap ng nakasulat na
impormasyon mula sa nagrereklamo.

Ang patunay nito ay dapat na kalakip sa
inihaing reklamo.
Paglakip ng Ebidensya
Ang mga reklamo na hindi sapat sa anyo at
nilalaman ay maaaring maging sanhi ng
outright dismissal ng reklamo. Upang
maiwasan ito, ang mga reklamong inihain sa
harap ng NPC ay dapat sumunod sa form at
mga nilalaman na tinukoy sa NPC Rules of
Procedure.

Dagdag pa, ang mga reklamo ay dapat na
may kasamang mga sumusuportang
dokumento at salaysay ng mga testigo
bilang ebidensya.

Ang mga reklamo na may hindi sapat na
ebidensya ay maaaring i-dismiss outright.
Hearing through Video Conferencing Technology
In observance of health and safety protocols due
to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, parties may
appear remotely for hearings before the National
Privacy Commission via video conferencing

protocol
sa
kalusugan at kaligtasan dahil sa patuloy na
pandemya ng Covid-19, ang mga pagdinig
sa National Privacy Commission ay
gagawin sa pamamagitan ng
video
conferencing technology.
How does the NPC deal with complaints?
Once a complaint has been filed, an
investigating officer will conduct the
proceedings. The investigating officer shall
evaluate the complaint to determine
whether its allegations involve a violation
of the Data Privacy Act or related issuances
and if based on its allegations, there is reason to believe that there is a privacy
violation or personal data breach.

The investigating officer shall then
determine whether the complaint may be
given due course or be dismissed outright
based on the following grounds:
Insufficient in form;
Did not give the respondent an
opportunity to address the
complaint;
Does not pertain to a violation of the
DPA or does not involve a privacy
violation or personal data breach;
Insufficient information to
substantiate the allegations in the
complaint; or
The parties cannot be identified or
traced despite diligent effort to
determine the same.
Paano hinarap ng NPC ang mga reklamo?
Kapag naihain na ang reklamo, ang
investigating officer ay magsasagawa ng mga
paglilitis. Dapat suriin ng investigating officer
ang reklamo upang matukoy kung ang mga
paratang nito ay nagsasangkot ng paglabag
sa Data Privacy Act o related issuances ng
NPC, at kung batay sa mga paratang nito, may dahilan upang maniwala na mayroong
paglabag sa
privacy
o
personal data breach.
Ang
investigating officer
ay dapat magpasiya
kung ang reklamo ay maaaring bigyan ng
angkop na kurso o ganap na i-
dismiss
batay
sa mga sumusunod:
Hindi tama ang
form;
Hindi binigyan ng pagkakataon ang
respondent
na tugunan ang reklamo;
Hindi tumutukoy sa isang paglabag sa DPA o hindi nagsasangkot ng paglabag sa
privacy
o
personal data breach;
Hindi sapat na impormasyon upang
patunayan ang mga paratang sa
reklamo; o
Ang mga partido ay hindi matukoy
o matunton sa kabila ng masigasig
na pagsisikap na matukoy ang mga
ito.
What happens when my complaint is upheld?
If your complaint is upheld, the case records
will be brought to the Enforcement Division
of the Legal and Enforcement Office, NPC
for the enforcement of civil damages, fines,
and other administrative sanctions, when
appropriate.

If the NPC decides that the filing of criminal
charges is warranted against certain
individuals following the filing and
processing of a complaint, the NPC will
forward the case record to the Department
of Justice and recommend their prosecution.
Ano ang mangyayari kapag napagtibay ang aking reklamo?
Kung ang iyong reklamo ay pinagtibay, ang
mga rekord ng kaso ay dadalhin sa
Enforcement Division ng Legal and Enforcement
Office,
NPC para sa pagpapatupad ng mga
pinsalang sibil (danyos), multa, at iba pang
administratibong parusa, kung naaangkop.

Kung magpasya ang NPC na ang
pagsasampa ng mga kasong kriminal ay
may katiyakan laban sa ilang indibidwal
kasunod ng pagsasampa at pagproseso ng
isang reklamo, ipapasa ng NPC ang rekord
ng kaso sa
Department of Justice
at
irerekomenda ang kanilang pag-uusig.
What happens when my complaint is dismissed?
If your complaint is dismissed, without
prejudice, this means you can file the
complaint again with the NPC.

If the complaint is dismissed for lack of
merit, you may file a Motion for
Reconsideration. Please state the grounds
for the mistakes of fact or law that may be
present in the NPC’s decision.

In any event, any Decision made on a
complaint may be appealed by any aggrieved party by way of appeal to the
proper Court, within the prescribed period.
Ano ang mangyayari kapag na-dismiss ang
aking reklamo?
Kung ang iyong reklamo ay na-
dismiss
without prejudice,
nangangahulugan ito na
maaari mong muling ihain ang reklamo sa
NPC.

Kung ang reklamo ay na-
dismissed on lack of
merit,
maaari kang maghain ng
Motion for
Reconsideration.
Mangyaring sabihin ang
mga batayan para sa mga
mistakes of fact or
law
na maaaring nasa desisyon ng NPC.

Sa anumang pangyayari, anumang
Decision
na ginawa sa isang reklamo ay maaaring
iapela ng sinumang naagrabyado na partido
sa pamamagitan ng pag-apela sa tamang
Korte, sa loob ng itinakdang panahon.
