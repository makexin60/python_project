We, the upjers GmbH (Ltd.) seated in Hafenstraße 13, 96052 Bamberg, Germany, are a developer and publisher of games for mobile devices (our “game apps”), which are made available in app stores such as the iTunes App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon App Store and Windows Store (hereafter referred to as “distribution platforms”). We are responsible for the provision of apps and related services (such as the support, our website, contests, newsletters, advertisement, etc.) (collectively “services”) and the processing of data.
In the following data privacy statement, you'll learn what we do with your data – so called personal data – and why. We will also tell you how we protect your data, when data will be deleted, and which rights you have thanks to data privacy protection.
Up front: We adhere to the data protection laws and protect your sphere of personal privacy to the best of our abilities. But we also want to be completely honest: the internet lives off data exchange and has many security leaks.

If you visit a different website, for example, via a link on our website, please be aware that this data protection declaration will not apply to that external website.

In-app purchases
Game version (for example, v1.23.111)

Approximate location, based on device language and time zone
Date and time of gaming sessions (for example, 11:45 am on May 25, 2018) *

Hardware (for example, Intel processor)
To protect your privacy
, we delete or anonymize most technical data and identifiers in our database after each session. All other data are used exclusively for the statistical optimization of the game, displaying interest-based ads (find out more in the section “Customized Advertising”) and offering our players a customized gaming experience (e.g. adapting the game to your playing habits).
The purpose
of saving these data for a limited period of time is to establish a connection to our game servers, which is necessary for the provision of our games and services and to offer you a more personal gaming experience.
The legal basis
is the contract with you, according to Art. 6, para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
7. Mobile Apps and App Permissions
When you download our games as mobile apps or make in-app purchases via a distribution platform (e.g. the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store), this platform will receive certain information about your account, such as your name, device type, e-mail address and payment information. We have no influence over this data collection and are not responsible for it.
Some of our game features require access to certain features and services on your device. Depending on your operating system, it may be necessary to accept certain app permissions. We will now explain what these permissions mean:
a) iOS
Push-Notifications: When you select okay in the pop-up window 'Allow push-notifications', you allow the app to inform you about certain events in the game, even if the app isn't currently running. You will get a notification in form of sounds, messages and symbols (a picture or a number on the app icon).
Game Center: Game apps may offer a connection to Apple's Game Center service, which is subject to Apple's privacy statement. You can read up on them here:
https://www.apple.com/privacy
. If you use the service to get notifications about achievements, for example, the information shared by you will be visible to other users and can be read, collected and used by them. You should think about which personal information you wish to share.
b) Android
External Storage (modify or delete your external storage, read content of your external storage): These functions allow an app to temporarily store content on your device. The app will only use its own storage space – other data in the external storage will not be deleted, modified or read.
Internet Connection (retrieve internet data, full network access, show network and WiFi connections): These functions allow the app to retrieve data from the internet and determine if there is an internet connection via a WiFi network or a mobile data connection. This is meant to prevent the app from using large amounts of data, which could exhaust your data volume.
Disable Sleep Mode: This function allows the app to disable your device's sleep mode (e.g. to watch videos without the screen going dark).
To protect your privacy
, all app permissions are optional, with the exception of technical permissions necessary for running the app. You can limit them at any time (by tapping on “no” or “do not accept”). You can also withdraw them later by changing the corresponding settings on your device.
The purpose
of the request for app permissions is to make the gaming app available to you and to keep you posted when it comes to game updates, game-related news and notifications.
The legal basis
for mandatory technical permissions is the fulfillment of a contract according to Art. 6, para. 1 lit. b GDPR. The legal basis for optional permissions is your approval according to Art. 6, para. 1, lit. a GDPR.

We and our trustworthy partners collect and process the Apple Advertising ID (IDFA) on iOS devices and the Google Advertising ID on Android devices to facilitate interest-based advertising and measure the success thereof. Advertising IDs are unique, but as the same time not personalized and non-permanent identification numbers provided by your device and operating system.

a) iOS
Open the iOS application “Settings” and tap on “Privacy” > “Advertising”. If you enable the option “Limit Live Tracking” we can only make limited use of the tracker, for example to identify unique users or combat fraud. You can also delete your IDFA (“Reset Advertising Identifier”) in the same menu; this creates a new ID that will not be merged with previously collected data.

17. Assertion, Exercise and Defense of Legal Claims
Sometimes it may be necessary for us to process personal data and, if required, sensitive personal data, in accordance with local laws and regulations, relating to the exercise or defense of legal claims. Article 9 para. 1 lit. f GDPR facilitates it, if the data processing “is essential for asserting, exercising and defending legal claims or if courts act in the course of their judicial activity”.
For instance, this may be the case if we need legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are legally obliged to preserve or disclose certain information in the course of legal proceedings.

When you download our games as mobile apps or make in-app purchases via a distribution platform (e.g. the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store), this platform will receive certain information about your account, such as your name, device type, e-mail address and payment information. We have no influence over this data collection and are not responsible for it.
Some of our game features require access to certain features and services on your device. Depending on your operating system, it may be necessary to accept certain app permissions. We will now explain what these permissions mean:

You will get a notification in form of sounds, messages and symbols (a picture or a number on the app icon).

https://www.apple.com/privacy
. If you use the service to get notifications about achievements, for example, the information shared by you will be visible to other users and can be read, collected and used by them. You should think about which personal information you wish to share.
b) Android
External Storage (modify or delete your external storage, read content of your external storage): These functions allow an app to temporarily store content on your device. The app will only use its own storage space – other data in the external storage will not be deleted, modified or read.
Internet Connection (retrieve internet data, full network access, show network and WiFi connections): These functions allow the app to retrieve data from the internet and determine if there is an internet connection via a WiFi network or a mobile data connection. This is meant to prevent the app from using large amounts of data, which could exhaust your data volume.
Disable Sleep Mode: This function allows the app to disable your device's sleep mode (e.g. to watch videos without the screen going dark).
To protect your privacy
, all app permissions are optional, with the exception of technical permissions necessary for running the app. You can limit them at any time (by tapping on “no” or “do not accept”). You can also withdraw them later by changing the corresponding settings on your device.

You will get a notification in form of sounds, messages and symbols (a picture or a number on the app icon).

This is meant to prevent the app from using large amounts of data, which could exhaust your data volume.
Disable Sleep Mode: This function allows the app to disable your device's sleep mode (e.g. to watch videos without the screen going dark).
To protect your privacy
, all app permissions are optional, with the exception of technical permissions necessary for running the app. You can limit them at any time (by tapping on “no” or “do not accept”). You can also withdraw them later by changing the corresponding settings on your device.
The purpose

As
security measure
we use servers located within the EU whenever it is possible. However, it can not be excluded that data is also transferred to the USA (compare
https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/
). In order to ensure an appropriate data protection level Google provides additional guarantees in the form of EU standardized contractual terms, which we concluded with Google (compare
https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/
).
Furthermore we concluded an order processing contract with Google in accordance with Art. 28 DSGVO (compare

13. Communication Within The Games
The games run by us offer you the opportunity to communicate with us or with other players. We use automatic filter systems, which prevent the plentiful sending of messages, insulting, violence-glorifying, obscene, racist or whatever offensive statements, or news with promotional character. We record the communication channels provided for a short time for the purposes of analyses and rectification of technical errors, for the warranty of system security and system integrity, for combating abusive and/or unauthorized usage, and for the preparation of user statistics on non-personal basis. The reports created contain date and time of the message, sender and recipient, the text message, as well as the transmitted amount of data.
Without your agreement, none of our staff-members will read messages. However, if we suspect abusive and/or unauthorized usage of the communication channels (for example, because a message recipient has reported inappropriate content), we reserve the right to examine the player account in question, including any messages sent by it and – if need be – take further action.
As a
measure of protection
, the transmission of the data entered by you will take place via an encrypted connection of the corresponding platform.

When you initialize the payment process in order to purchase premium currency in a gaming app, you will have to enter additional data. The required data depends on the payment method you selected. Distribution platforms offer a variety of services for payment processing which you can choose from.
Distribution platforms often work together with external payment providers, such as PayPal, credit card companies, etc. These external payment providers are obligated by law to handle your data confidentially and securely, and they are only allowed to use your data as far as it is necessary for the fulfillment of their task.
You are free to choose which of the offered payment methods you use; in this regard we refer to the data privacy protection statements and notes on the matter on the sites of the distribution platforms and payment providers.
Once a transaction is completed successfully, the distribution platform will send feedback to upjers, which will confirm the success of the transaction.
15. (Personalized) Advertisements
If applicable we use advertising technologies in our games and exchange non-personal IDs with external advertising networks to improve personalized advertising in our games. We and our trustworthy partners collect and process the Apple Advertising ID (IDFA) on iOS devices and the Google Advertising ID on Android devices to facilitate interest-based advertising and measure the success thereof. Advertising IDs are unique, but as the same time not personalized and non-permanent identification numbers provided by your device and operating system. In the following you can find out how to enable/disable these advertising technologies within the mobile gaming apps:
a) iOS
Open the iOS application “Settings” and tap on “Privacy” > “Advertising”. If you enable the option “Limit Live Tracking” we can only make limited use of the tracker, for example to identify unique users or combat fraud. You can also delete your IDFA (“Reset Advertising Identifier”) in the same menu; this creates a new ID that will not be merged with previously collected data.
b) Android
Open the “Settings” app and tap on “Google”. Depending on your device, you might not find this option in the main menu, but you can use the search feature at the top of the settings menu to find it. Select “Ads” and enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” option to prevent profile creation and the display of interest-based advertising. You can delete your advertising ID (“Reset advertising ID”) in the same menu; this creates a new ID that will not be merged with previously collected data.
In the interest of your personal privacy
, personal data is only stored temporarily. Furthermore, users can disable interest-based advertising in the device settings as described above. We also commit to ensuring that our external service partners commit to maintaining high standards of data protection by negotiating data protection agreements. Furthermore we concluded an order-processing contract with the external advertisement networks according to Art. 28 GDPR.
The
purpose
of personalized advertising is to offer our players ads which appeal to their interests and keep our games free for a broad player base.
The
legal basis
is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR, which we be obtained before a corresponding data processing takes place.
16. Video Advertisements
Video advertisements are integrated into our games in various places. Therein our advertising partners provide selected content for users, which we will run for them. We would like to note that our free2play system also lives off our advertising partners, and we are committed to employing their services in the interest of our users. If you watch video ads as a player, you can earn premium currency or other in-game perks. If you have any questions regarding this, please contact our customer support:
https://support.upjers.com/en/start
We work together with the following providers:
a) unityAds
We work with our partner Unity Technologies (Unity Technologies, 30 3rd Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA; Unity Technologies GmbH, Ritterstrasse 11, 10969 Berlin, Germany). Unity uses technologies to display, manage and optimize ads for users.
As
measures of protection
, we only process pseudonymized usage data and offer our users an option to opt out. If you would like to opt out of the collection of anonymized information, you can do so at
https://unity3d.com/legal/cookie-policy#cookies
. Alternatively, you can adjust settings or revoke permission for data processing within the game using the link “unity Privacy.”
Furthermore we have concluded an agreement with Unity in accordance with Art. 26 GDPR, which states that both, we and Unity, are responsible for processing your data.
Therefore you can direct any questions about the data processing to us as well as unity. You can find contact information at:
https://unity3d.com/contact/addresses
To secure and defend international data transfer within its own businesses, Unity has established so-called Binding Corporate Rules (BCR). These are data privacy protection agreements with guarantee a unified level of data privacy protection for all of its corporations.
The purpose
of this data processing is to enable the playing of ads which make our free2play offer possible.
The legal basis
is your consent in accordance with Art. 6. para. 1 lit. a GDPR, which will be given in advance before the activation of the video player and the running of advertising videos by clicking on the confirmation button on the preceding site.
b) Google Admob
We use the service "Admob" by Google LLC., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, EU Branch Office:  Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Personalized advertisements can be displaying within an app by using Admob. Google specifically collects data regarding device, utilization and location of the gaming device by using a software which is integrated into the corresponding app.  Due to this data Google is able to select advertisements, which are tailored to the user’s interests, and display them. Furthermore Google uses this data to further optimize its services. Information on Google’s data processing can be gathered from its data privacy declaration:
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
In order to execute this service, Google also forwards data to advertisement networks. A listing of these networks and their data privacy declarations can be found here:
https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9012903
Due to security measures only pseudonymized utilization data is processed. You can always change the settings concerning data processing in the settings menu of the corresponding gaming app by using the link “Admob Privacy”.
Google provides the contractual terms and conditions for the utilization of the service, whereupon upjers and Google are independently of each other responsible parties regarding the data processing:
https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/
We recommend to contact Google directly concerning inquiries regarding data processing, because only Google collects personalized data in the scope of Admob.
Since Google’s registered office is in the USA and therefore in a so-called third country, further guarantees are required to assure a data privacy protection level which is appropriate for European standards.
Google got a certification in accordance with the so-called EU-US Privacy Shield and in doing so proved a corresponding data protection level:
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI
The purpose
of the utilization of Admob and Google’s data processing connected to that is the usage of advertising means to enable our free services.
The legal basis
is your consent in accordance with Art. 6. para. 1 lit. a GDPR, which will be given in advance before the activation of the video player and the running of advertising videos by clicking on the confirmation button on the preceding site.
17. Assertion, Exercise and Defense of Legal Claims
Sometimes it may be necessary for us to process personal data and, if required, sensitive personal data, in accordance with local laws and regulations, relating to the exercise or defense of legal claims. Article 9 para. 1 lit. f GDPR facilitates it, if the data processing “is essential for asserting, exercising and defending legal claims or if courts act in the course of their judicial activity”.
For instance, this may be the case if we need legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are legally obliged to preserve or disclose certain information in the course of legal proceedings.
18. Personal Data of Children
upjers is aware of the significance of safety and data protection of children on the internet. Therefore, and to comply with specific laws, we neither intentionally collect personal, individually identifiable information about children under the age of 16, nor do we offer content for children under 16.
19. Change of Data Privacy Statement
upjers reserves the right to change this data privacy statement at any time, however, upjers will always adhere to the currently applicable data security laws. upjers advises you to inform yourself about the current data privacy statement any time you visit our websites or games.

Privacy. That’s Apple.
Privacy.
That’s Apple.
Privacy is a fundamental human right. It’s also one of our core values. Which is why we design our products and services to protect it. That’s the kind of innovation we believe in.
Apple Intelligence.
Great powers come
with great privacy.
Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself, and get things done effortlessly. With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple.
On-device
processing
allows Apple Intelligence to be aware of your data without collecting your data.
On-device processing
The cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on‑device processing, which gives Apple Intelligence the ability to fulfill many of your requests without leaving your device.
Deeply integrated into your iPhone, iPad, and Mac
Powered by Apple silicon
Designed to protect your privacy at every step
Private Cloud Compute
extends the privacy of Apple devices for more complex requests.
Private Cloud Compute
Some requests require more computational power than what fits in your pocket. For these more complex requests, Apple Intelligence can draw on Private Cloud Compute and extend the privacy of your Apple devices to Apple silicon servers.
Your data is only used for your requests
Your data is never stored or made accessible to anyone
Independent experts can verify its privacy promise

Locked and Hidden Apps.
Choose
what’s
visible.
Locked and Hidden Apps
Locked apps allow you to show your screen to someone while protecting sensitive areas of your phone. For additional privacy, you can hide a locked app. This removes the hidden app’s name and icon from the Home Screen and search results, and pauses its notifications. You can access locked or hidden apps with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.
Private Browsing.
Powerfully
private.
Private Browsing
When you turn on Private Browsing, Safari won’t save the sites you visit, your searches, or any information from forms you fill out. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections help prevent websites from tracking or identifying your device. And your private browsing windows automatically lock when you’re not using them.
Passkeys.
Simple.
Secure.
So not a
password
.
Passkeys
A passkey eliminates the need for a password by using a unique digital key that only works from the site or app it was created for, so you don’t have to worry about website leaks or phishing. Passkeys are securely synced across Apple devices. Just use Touch ID or Face ID to authenticate and you’re done.
Lock Hidden Albums.
Keep Hidden
and Recently
Deleted
photos
private.
Lock Hidden Albums
Your Hidden and Recently Deleted albums in Photos are locked by default and can be unlocked using your device’s authentication method — Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.
Safety Check.
Take
control
in times of crisis.
Safety Check
Safety Check is a section in Settings that helps people in domestic or intimate partner violence situations quickly reset the access they’ve granted to others. It also helps you manage which people and apps you’ve given access to.

App Tracking Transparency.
Decide which
apps are

track

you.
App Tracking Transparency
Make more informed choices about the apps you use and the permissions you grant them. Apps are required to ask your permission when they want to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. And you can change your preference for any app or prevent apps from asking for permission entirely in Settings.
Mail Privacy Protection.
Read
Read
,
delete
,
and
reply
with peace
of mind.
Mail Privacy Protection
Mail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can’t link it to your other online activity or determine your location. And it prevents senders from seeing if and when you’ve opened their email.
Our apps mind their business. Not yours.
Safari throws trackers off your trail.
Safari
Some websites allow hundreds of different data collection companies to watch you, build a profile of you, and serve you ads as you browse the web. Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari uses on-device machine learning to help block those trackers. And you can get a snapshot of all the cross-site trackers Safari is blocking by visiting your Privacy Report in the Safari toolbar.
When you use Private Browsing, the details of your browsing aren’t saved, and the websites you visit aren’t shared with your other Apple devices. And starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Private Browsing locks your private browsing windows when you’re not using them, completely blocks known trackers from loading on pages, and removes tracking added to URLs as you browse.
View all privacy features
Health keeps your records under wraps.
Health
From your heart rate to your menstrual cycle, apps and devices for your health can give you insight into some of your most personal details. With the Health app, you’re in charge of what information you’d like to include, what not to, and who has access to it.
When you do want to securely share your health data from the Health app with your doctors, they’ll see the data you shared in a dashboard in the provider’s health records system.
All of your data is encrypted and only accessible with your passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID. So however you use the Health app, you’re always in control of your data.
Wallet and Apple Pay help hide what you buy.
Wallet and Apple Pay
When you make a purchase, Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code. So your card number is never stored on your device or on Apple servers. And when you pay, your card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants.
When you pay with a debit or credit card, Apple Pay doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you. And when you use Apple Cash, information is stored only for troubleshooting, fraud prevention, and regulatory purposes.
Maps makes your location history, history.
Maps
Where you go says a lot about you. Maps delivers a great experience without Apple knowing which stores, neighborhoods, or clinics you visit. And because Maps doesn’t include a sign-in, where you go isn’t associated with your Apple Account at all.
Personalized features, like locating your parked car, are created right on your device. Data used to improve navigation, such as routes and search terms, is not associated with your identity. Instead, that information is based on random identifiers that are constantly changing.
Photos lets you choose who has the full picture.
Photos
Your photo and video albums are full of precious moments, friends, and your favorite things. Apple devices are designed to give you control over those memories.
Photos is also designed so that the face recognition and scene and object detection — which power features like For You, Memories, Sharing Suggestions, and the People album — happen on device instead of in the cloud. In fact, the A13 Bionic and later chips perform over 100 billion operations per photo to recognize faces and places without ever leaving your device. And when apps request access to your photos, you can share just the images you want — not your entire library.
Messages are only seen by who you send them to.
Messages
From inside jokes to invitations, a lot of life happens in text and video chats. Every blue-bubble message, picture, Animoji, and video is encrypted while being sent between devices.
Smart suggestions in Messages, like pulling up photos to send based on who you’re messaging, are all done on your device.
Siri learns what you need. Not who you are.
Siri
Siri was designed from the beginning to learn your preferences without sharing your identity with Apple or anyone else. You don’t sign in with your Apple Account to use Siri, and the audio of your requests is processed entirely on your device thanks to the power of the Apple Neural Engine.
When Apple does process or store data on our servers, it’s associated with a random identifier — a long string of letters and numbers. That data is used only to improve Siri, and we never share or sell it. Apple doesn’t retain audio of your requests unless you choose to share it with us to improve Siri.
Apple News leaves what you read off the record.
Apple News
Many news sources keep track of your identity and create a profile of you. Apple News delivers personalized content without knowing who you are. The content you read is associated with a random identifier, not your Apple Account.
You get editor-curated content and a personalized newsfeed so you can stay up to date with the latest news and stories. And because Apple News uses machine learning, the more you use it, the better your app gets to know what you like — without Apple ever knowing what you’re into.
App Store shows you what’s in store for your data.
App Store
Every one of the more than 1.8 million apps on the App Store is required to follow strict privacy guidelines and report how it uses your data. And every app is rigorously reviewed by a team of experts at Apple.
When you’re checking out an app, you’ll see its Privacy Nutrition Label to help you decide if it works for you. Apps you choose to download need your permission to access information like your photos or location — and you can always change your mind about what you share. iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 or later require developers to get your permission before tracking your activity across other companies’ apps and websites for ads or data brokers.

Transfer to Third Countries
If personal data is being transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area, we only transfer it to third countries where the EU Commission has confirmed an adequate level of protection or where we can ensure the careful handling of personal data by means of contractual agreements (Standard Contract Clauses) or other suitable guarantees, such as certifications or proven compliance with international security standards. Information on this is available from us upon request.
Data Privacy Framework
Adjust Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Adjust Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, Adjust Inc. commits to cooperate and comply with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, Adjust Inc. commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF should first contact Adjust Inc. at:
privacy@adjust.com
If you are an EU individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see below) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Choice: If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Policy, Adjust will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of Personal Data should be sent to us at
privacy@adjust.com
2. Tracking Technologies on our Website
Google Analytics
We use the Google Analytics service of the provider Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland on our website.
Google Analytics is a web analytics service that allows us to collect and analyze data about the behavior of visitors to our website. Google Analytics uses cookies for this purpose, which enable an analysis of the use of our website. This involves processing of personal data in the form of online identifiers (including cookie identifiers), IP addresses, device identifiers and information about interaction with our website.
Some of this data is information that is stored in the terminal device you are using. In addition, further information is also stored on your end device via the cookies used. Such storage of information by Google Analytics or access to information that is already stored in your terminal device only takes place with your consent.
Google Ireland will process the data collected in this way on our behalf in order to evaluate the use of our website by the users, to compile reports on the activities within our website and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our website and the use of the internet. In doing so, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.
The personal data processed on our behalf to provide Google Analytics may be transferred to any country in which Google Ireland or Google Ireland's sub-processors maintain facilities. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries".
In addition to the option to reject Google Analytics in our Consent Banner, you can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google Ireland within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the IP address be transferred to Google on a server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other data. You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
We use the Google Analytics 4 variant, which allows us to track interaction data from different devices and from different sessions. This allows us to put individual user actions in context and analyze long-term relationships.
The data about user actions are stored for a period of 14 months and then automatically deleted. All other event data is stored for 2 months and are then automatically deleted. Thereby, the deletion of the data whose storage period has expired takes place automatically once a month.
Google Ads
We use the online advertising program Google Ads of Google Ireland, Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”) on our website, through which we place advertisements on the Google search engine. When you access our website via a Google ad, Google sets a cookie on your terminal device ("conversion cookie"). In the process, a different conversion cookie is assigned to each Google Ads customer, so that the cookies are not tracked across the websites of different Ads customers. The information obtained with the help of the cookie is used to create conversion statistics. This tells us the total number of users who clicked on one of our Google ads. However, we do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified. When using the service, a transfer of your data to the USA cannot be excluded. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries". You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
Google Remarketing
We also use the Google Analytics advertising features (remarketing) from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This function enables us, in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google, to display advertisements in a more targeted manner and to present users with ads that are tailored to their interests. Via the remarketing, users are shown ads and products for which interest has been identified on other websites in the Google network. The function allows us to link advertising target groups created via Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device functions of Google Ads. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to a user depending on previous usage and surfing behavior on an end device (e.g. cell phone) can also be displayed on another end device of the user (e.g. tablet or PC).
If you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history with your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be placed on every end device on which you log in with your Google account. The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based solely on your consent, which you can give or withdraw at Google. For these linked services, data is then collected via Google Analytics for advertising purposes. To support the remarketing function, Google Analytics collects users' Google-authenticated IDs, which are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data. This is used to define and create target groups for cross-device ad advertising.
Privacy policy of Google:

https://support.google.com/My-Ad-Center-Help/answer/12155451?hl=en&sjid=174251308182856932-EU
.
Google Signals
We use the Signals feature of Google Analytics, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Signals recognises individual users using different devices (so-called cross-device tracking). We only receive anonymous data in the form of a report that shows patterns in user behaviour. Google Signals helps us to better understand how visitors interact with our website and to show more meaningful and personalized ads to these visitors after leaving our website.
For this, session data is being processed and linked with website visitors that
• have a Google account;
• are logged in to their Google account when they access the corresponding website; and
• have turned on the “Ads personalization” feature in their Google account.
If you do not wish to be subject to the Signals feature, you can deactivate the “Ads personalization” feature in your Google account.
The privacy policy of Google can be found here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en
Meta Pixel (formerly known as Facebook Pixel)
We use the "visitor action pixels" from Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Meta") on our website. This allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to our website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Meta, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Meta may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with
Facebook's Data Usage Policy
. You can allow Meta and its partners to place ads on and off Facebook. A cookie may also be stored on your computer for these purposes. You can object to the collection of your data by Meta pixel, or to the use of your data for the purpose of displaying Facebook ads in your account-settings. You can find Meta's privacy policy here:
https://de-de.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?entry_point=data_policy_redirect&entry=0
.
LinkedIn Insight Tag
The LinkedIn Insight Tag is a piece of lightweight JavaScript code that we have added to our websites to enable in-depth campaign reporting and to help us unlock valuable insights about our website visitors. The LinkedIn Insight Tag is offered by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland. We use the LinkedIn Insight Tag to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and unlock additional insights about members interacting with our LinkedIn adverts. The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of metadata such as IP address information, timestamp, and events such as page views. All data is encrypted. The LinkedIn browser cookie is stored in a visitor's browser until they delete the cookie or the cookie expires. You can opt out of cookies from LinkedIn on your
LinkedIn settings page
and recommend you read their
Cookie Policy
for more information. ​​You can find LinkedIn's privacy policy here:

Marketing Cloud Account Engagement (formerly Salesforce Pardot)
Marketing Cloud Account Engagement is a B2B marketing automation tool by Salesforce, which we use to keep customers informed about upcoming events, product updates/ new features, etc. This marketing tool is embedded in our website for general marketing purposes, including e-mail, social media, digital ads, web management and analytics. For this marketing tool, we use cookies to identify you when you visit and re-visit our website. With this tool we track different data points when you are using our website in order to improve the website content we provide to you as well as to improve our marketing campaigns and make their content more relevant for you.

Microsoft Advertising
We use Universal Event Tracking (UET) on our website via the Microsoft Advertising service of Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.

1.
Data Centre & Network Security
(a)
Data Centres
.
Infrastructure
. Google maintains geographically distributed data centres. Google stores all production data in physically secure data centres.
Redundancy
. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimise the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Dual circuits, switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. The Processor Services are designed to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and corrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer's or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data centre equipment is scheduled through a standard process according to documented procedures.
Power
. The data centre electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, each with equal capacity, is provided for critical infrastructure components in the data centre. Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide transitory power to the data centre, at full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the backup generator systems take over. The backup generators are capable of automatically starting up within seconds to provide enough emergency electrical power to run the data centre at full capacity typically for a period of days.
Server Operating Systems
. Google servers use hardened operating systems which are customised for the unique server needs of the business. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms to augment data security and redundancy. Google employs a code review process to increase the security of the code used to provide the Processor Services and enhance the security products in production environments.
Business Continuity
. Google replicates data over multiple systems to help to protect against accidental destruction or loss. Google has designed and regularly plans and tests its business continuity planning/disaster recovery programs.
Encryption Technologies
. Google’s security policies mandate encryption at rest for all user data, including personal data. Data is often encrypted at multiple levels in Google’s production storage stack in data centres, including at the hardware level, without requiring any action by customers. Using multiple layers of encryption adds redundant data protection and allows Google to select the optimal approach based on application requirements. All personal data is encrypted at the storage level, generally using AES256. Google uses common cryptographic libraries which incorporate Google’s FIPS 140-2 validated module, to implement encryption consistently across the Processor Services.
(b)
Networks & Transmission
.
Data Transmission
. Data centres are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centres. Further, Google encrypts data transmitted between data centres. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during electronic transport. Google transfers data via Internet standard protocols.
External Attack Surface
. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems.
Intrusion Detection
. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google’s intrusion detection involves:
1.
Tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through preventative measures;
2.
Employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and
3.
Employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.
Incident Response
. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.
Encryption Technologies
. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as TLS connection) available. Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA and ECDSA. These perfect forward secrecy (PFS) methods help protect traffic and minimise the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough.
2.
Access and Site Controls
(a)
Site Controls
.
On-site Data Centre Security Operation
. Google’s data centres maintain an on-site security operation responsible for all physical data centre security functions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The on-site security operations personnel monitor Closed Circuit TV (“
CCTV
”) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform internal and external patrols of the data centre regularly.
Data Centre Access Procedures
. Google maintains formal access procedures for allowing physical access to the data centres. The data centres are housed in facilities that require electronic card key access, with alarms that are linked to the on-site security operation. All entrants to the data centre are required to identify themselves as well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorised employees, contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centres. Only authorised employees and contractors are permitted to request electronic card key access to these facilities. Data centre electronic card key access requests must be made in advance and in writing, and require the approval of authorised data centre personnel. All other entrants requiring temporary data centre access must: (i) obtain approval in advance from authorised data centre personnel for the specific data centre and internal areas they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an approved data centre access record identifying the individual as approved.
On-site Data Centre Security Devices
. Google’s data centres employ an electronic card key and biometric access control system that is linked to a system alarm. The access control system monitors and records each individual’s electronic card key and when they access perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas. Unauthorised activity and failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and investigated, as appropriate. Authorised access throughout the business operations and data centres is restricted based on zones and the individual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centres are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the data centres. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the data centre building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security operations personnel manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables throughout the data centres connect the CCTV equipment. Cameras record on-site via digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are retained for at least 7 days based on activity.
(b)
Access Control
.
Infrastructure Security Personnel
. Google has, and maintains, a security policy for its personnel, and requires security training as part of the training package for its personnel. Google’s infrastructure security personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the Processor Services, and responding to security incidents.
Access Control and Privilege Management
. Customer's administrators and users must authenticate themselves via a central authentication system or via a single sign on system in order to use the Processor Services.
Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy
. Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorised persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorised persons to access data they are authorised to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralised access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilising digital certificates are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimise the potential for unauthorised account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g. login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.
3.
Data
(a)
Data Storage, Isolation & Authentication
.
Google stores data in a multi-tenant environment on Google-owned servers. Data, the Processor Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple geographically dispersed data centres. Google logically isolates each customer's data. A central authentication system is used across all Processor Services to increase uniform security of data.
(b)
Decommissioned Disks and Disk Destruction Guidelines
.
Certain disks containing data may experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that lead them to be decommissioned (“
Decommissioned Disk
”). Every Decommissioned Disk is subject to a series of data destruction processes (the “
Data Destruction Guidelines
”) before leaving Google’s premises either for reuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multi-step process and verified complete by at least two independent validators. The erase results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally, the erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory for reuse and redeployment. If, due to hardware failure, the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely stored until it can be destroyed. Each facility is audited regularly to monitor compliance with the Data Destruction Guidelines.
(c)
Pseudonymous Data
.
Online advertising data are commonly associated with online identifiers which on their own are considered ’pseudonymous’ (i.e. they cannot be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional information). Google has a robust set of policies and technical and organisational controls in place to ensure the separation between pseudonymous data and personally identifiable user information (i.e. information that could be used on its own to directly identify, contact, or precisely locate an individual), such as a user’s Google account data. Google policies only allow for information flows between pseudonymous and personally identifiable data in strictly limited circumstances.
(d)
Launch reviews
.
Google conducts launch reviews for new products and features prior to launch. This includes a privacy review conducted by specially trained privacy engineers. In privacy reviews, privacy engineers ensure that all applicable Google policies and guidelines are followed, including but not limited to policies relating to pseudonymisation and data retention and deletion.
4.
Personnel Security
Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate background checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations.
Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel are provided with security training. Personnel handling Customer Personal Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role. Google’s personnel will not process Customer Personal Data without authorisation.
5.
Subprocessor Security
Before onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the security and privacy practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. Once Google has assessed the risks presented by the Subprocessor, the Subprocessor is required to enter into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms, subject to the requirements set out in Section 11.3 (Requirements for Subprocessor Engagement).

7.
Data Transfers
7.1
Restricted European Transfers
. The parties acknowledge that European Data
                    Protection Legislation does not require SCCs or an Alternative Transfer Solution in order to process
                    Customer Personal Data in or transfer it to an Adequate Country. If Customer Personal Data is transferred to
                    any other country, and European Data Protection Legislation applies to the transfers (“
Restricted
                      European Transfers
”), then:
(a)
if Google has adopted an Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted European
                      Transfers, then Google will inform Customer of the relevant solution and ensure that such Restricted
                      European Transfers are made in accordance with that solution; and/or
(b)
if Google has not adopted, or informs Customer that Google is no longer adopting an
                      Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted European Transfers, then:
(i)
if Google’s address is in an Adequate Country:
(A)
the SCCs (Processor-to-Processor, Google Exporter) will apply with respect to such
                          Restricted European Transfers from Google to Subprocessors; and
(B)
in addition, if Customer’s address is not in an Adequate Country, the SCCs
                          (Processor-to-Controller) will apply with respect to Restricted European Transfers between Google
                          and Customer (regardless of whether Customer is a controller and/or a processor); or
(ii)
if Google’s address is not in an Adequate Country, the SCCs (Controller-to-Processor)
                        and/or SCCs (Processor-to-Processor) will apply (according to whether Customer is a controller and/or
                        processor) with respect to such Restricted European Transfers between Customer and Google.
7.2
Supplementary Measures and Information
. Google will provide Customer with
                    information relevant to Restricted European Transfers, including information about supplementary measures to
                    protect Customer Personal Data, as described in Section 7.5 (Verifying Compliance), Appendix 2 (Security
                    Measures) and other materials concerning the nature of the Processor Services and the processing of Customer
                    Personal Data (for example, help centre articles).
7.3
Termination
. If Customer concludes, based on its current or intended use of
                    the Processor Services, that the Alternative Transfer Solution and/or SCCs, as applicable, do not provide
                    appropriate safeguards for Customer Personal Data, then Customer may immediately terminate the Agreement for
                    convenience by notifying Google in writing.
7.4
Alternative Transfer Solution Adoption and Certification
. Information about
                    Google and/or its Affiliates’ adoption of, or certification under, any Alternative Transfer Solutions can be
                    found at
https://business.safety.google/adsdatatransfers
.
8.
Subprocessors
. When engaging any Subprocessor, Google will ensure via a written contract that if
                  the processing of Customer Personal Data is subject to European Data Protection Legislation, the data protection
                  obligations in these Data Processing Terms (as referred to in Article 28(3) of the GDPR, if applicable) are
                  imposed on the Subprocessor.
9.
Google’s Processing Records.

(a)
collect and maintain records of certain information, including: (i) the name and contact
                    details of each processor and/or controller on behalf of which Google is acting and (if applicable) of such
                    processor’s or controller's local representative and data protection officer, and (ii) if applicable under
                    the Customer SCCs, Customer’s Supervisory Authority; and
(b)
make such information available to any Supervisory Authority. Accordingly, Customer will,
                    where requested and as applicable to Customer, provide such information to Google via the user interface of
                    the Processor Services or via such other means as may be provided by Google, and will use such user
                    interface or other means to ensure that all information provided is kept accurate and up-to-date.

3.2
Data Security
3.2.1
Customer’s Security Responsibilities and Assessment.
(a)
Customer’s Security Responsibilities.
In addition to Customer’s security
                        responsibilities under Section 7.3.1 of these Data Processing Terms, Customer agrees that, without prejudice
                        to Google’s obligations under Sections 7.1 (Google’s Security Measures and Assistance) and 7.2 (Data
                        Incidents) of these Data Processing Terms, Customer is responsible for its use of the RDP Services,
                        including: (1) making appropriate use of the RDP Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the
                        risk in respect of Customer Personal Data; and (2) securing the account authentication credentials, systems
                        and devices Customer uses to access the RDP Services.
(b)
Customer’s Audit Rights.
(i)
Customer may conduct an audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under
                          this Appendix 3B by requesting and reviewing (1) a certificate issued for security verification
                          reflecting the outcome of an audit conducted by a third party auditor (e.g., SOC 2 Type II or ISO/IEC
                          27001 certification or a comparable certification or other security certification of an audit conducted
                          by a third-party auditor agreed by Customer and Google) within 12 months as of the date of Customer’s
                          request and (2) any other information Google determines is reasonably necessary for Customer to verify
                          such compliance.
(ii)
Alternatively, Google may, at its sole discretion and in response to a request by
                          Customer, initiate a third-party audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under this
                          Appendix 3B. During such an audit, Google will make available to the third-party auditor all information
                          necessary to demonstrate such compliance. Where Customer requests such an audit, Google may charge a fee
                          (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any audit. Google will provide Customer with further details of
                          any applicable fee, and the basis of its calculation, in advance of any such audit. Customer will be
                          responsible for any fees charged by any third-party auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such
                          audit.
(iii)
Nothing in this Appendix 3B will require Google either to disclose to Customer or its
                          third-party auditor, or to allow Customer or its third-party auditor to access:
(1)
any data of any other customer of a Google Entity;
(2)
any Google Entity’s internal accounting or financial information;
(3)
any trade secret of a Google Entity;
(4)
any information that, in Google's reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise the
                            security of any Google Entity’s systems or premises; or (B) cause any Google Entity to breach its
                            obligations under the US State Privacy Laws or its security and/or privacy obligations to Customer
                            or any third party; or
(5)
any information that Customer or its third party auditor seeks to access for any
                            reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer’s obligations under the US State Privacy
                            Laws.
3.3
Data Subject Rights.
For the purposes of this Appendix 3B, Google will adhere to
                    the procedures set forth under Section 9 (Data Subject Requests) to the extent such requests, requests for
                    assistance, or rectification is applicable to the RDP Services.
3.4
Subcontractors.

Customer generally authorizes Google to engage other entities as subcontractors in
                      connection with the provision of the RDP Services. When engaging any subcontractor, Google will:
(i)
ensure via a written contract that: (A) the subcontractor only accesses and uses
                        Customer Personal Data to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it, and does
                        so in accordance with the Agreement (including this Appendix 3B); and (B) if the processing of Customer
                        Personal Data is subject to the US State Privacy Laws, ensure that the data protection obligations in
                        this Appendix 3B are imposed on the subcontractor;
(ii)
when engaging any new subcontractors, provide notice of such new subcontractors where
                        required by US State Privacy Laws, and, where required by US State Privacy Laws, further provide an
                        opportunity for Customer to object to such subcontractors; and
(iii)
remain fully liable for all obligations subcontracted to, and all acts and omissions of,
                        the subcontractor.
(b)
Customer may object to any new subcontractor by terminating the Agreement for convenience
                      immediately upon written notice to Google, on condition that Customer provides such notice within 90 days of
                      being informed of the engagement of the new subcontractor as described in paragraph 3.4(a)(ii) herein.

Controller SCCs
5.1
Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Customer.
To the extent
                    that:
(a)
Google transfers European Controller Personal Data to Customer; and
(b)
the transfer is a Restricted European Transfer, Customer as data importer will be deemed
                      to have entered into the Controller SCCs with Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End
                      Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs.
5.2
Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Customer
. To the extent that:
(a)
Google transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Customer; and
(b)
the transfer is a Restricted European Transfer,
                      Customer as data importer will be deemed to have entered into the Controller SCCs with Google LLC (the
                      applicable Google End Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Controller

                    acknowledge that to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to Google, the
                    Controller SCCs are not required because the address of Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End
                    Controller) is in an Adequate Country and such transfers are Permitted European Transfers. This does not
                    affect Google’s obligations under paragraph 4.1 (Restricted European Transfers) of this Appendix 1A.
5.4
Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google.
To the extent that
                    Customer transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Google, Customer as data exporter will be deemed to have
                    entered into the Controller SCCs with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data importer and
                    the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs, because Google LLC’s address is not in an Adequate
                    Country.

or through
                      such other means as may be provided by Google from time to time.
(b)
Customer acknowledges that Google is required under the Controller SCCs to record
                      certain information, including (i) the identity and contact details of the data importer (including any
                      contact person with responsibility for data protection); and (ii) the technical and organisational
                      measures implemented by the data importer. Accordingly, Customer will, where requested and as applicable
                      to Customer, provide such information to Google via such means as may be provided by Google, and will
                      ensure that all information provided is kept accurate and up-to-date.
5.6
Responding to Data Subject Enquiries
. The applicable data importer will be
                    responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the supervisory authority concerning the

(b)
Customer terminates the Agreement in accordance with Clause 16(c) of the Controller
                      SCCs, then for the purposes of Clause 16(d) of the Controller SCCs, Customer directs Google to delete
                      Controller Personal Data, and, unless European Laws require storage, Google will facilitate such
                      deletion as soon as is reasonably practicable, to the extent such deletion is reasonably possible
                      (taking into account that Google is an independent Controller of such data, as well as the nature and
                      functionality of the Controller Services).
6.
Liability if Controller SCCs Apply.
If Controller SCCs apply under paragraph 5 (Controller SCCs) of this Appendix 1A, then the total combined
                  liability of:
(a)
Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited towards Customer; and
(b)
Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited,
                    under or in connection with the Agreement and the Controller SCCs combined will be subject to Section 5
                    (Liability). Clause 12 of the Controller SCCs will not affect the previous sentence.
7.
Third-Party Beneficiaries
Where Google LLC and/or Google Ireland Limited are not a party to the Agreement but are a party to the
                  applicable Controller SCCs in accordance with paragraph 5 (Controller SCCs) of this Appendix 1A, Google LLC
                  and/or Google Ireland Limited (as applicable) will be a third-party beneficiary of Section 4.3 (End Controllers)
                  and paragraphs 3 (Google End Controllers), 5 (Controller SCCs) and 6 (Liability if Controller SCCs Apply) of
                  this Appendix 1A. To the extent this paragraph 7 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) conflicts or is inconsistent with
                  any other clause in the Agreement, this paragraph 7 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) will apply.

8.1
If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Controller SCCs, this Appendix 1A, the
                    remainder of these Controller Terms and/or the remainder of the Agreement, then the Controller SCCs will
                    prevail.
8.2
Additional Commercial Clauses
. Subject to the amendments in these
                    Controller Terms, the Agreement remains in full force and effect. Paragraphs 5.5 (Contacting Google) to 5.7

                    additional commercial clauses relating to the Controller SCCs as permitted by Clause 2(a) (Effect and
                    invariability of the Clauses) of the Controller SCCs.
8.3
No Modification of Controller SCCs

                        responsible for providing the Notification Email Address and ensuring that the Notification Email
                        Address is current and valid.

No Acknowledgement of Fault by Google.
Google’s notification of or response to a Data Incident under this paragraph 3.3.2
                        (Data Incidents) will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Google of any fault or liability
                        with respect to the Data Incident.
3.3.3
Customer’s Security Responsibilities and Assessment.
(a)
Customer’s Security Responsibilities.
Customer agrees that, without
                        prejudice to Google’s obligations under paragraphs 3.3.1 (Google’s Security Measures and Assistance)
                        and 3.3.2 (Data Incidents):
(i)
Customer is responsible for its use of the RDP Services, including: (1) making
                          appropriate use of the RDP Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in
                          respect of Customer Personal Data; and (2) securing the account authentication credentials,
                          systems and devices Customer uses to access the RDP Services; and
(ii)
Google has no obligation to protect Customer Personal Data that Customer elects
                          to store or transfer outside of Google’s and its subcontractors’ systems.
(b)
Customer’s Security Assessment.
Customer acknowledges and agrees
                        that the Security Measures implemented and maintained by Google as set out in paragraph 3.3.1(a)
                        (Google’s Security Measures) provide a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of
                        Customer Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and
                        the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of Customer Personal Data as well as the
                        risks to individuals.
(c)
Customer’s Audit Rights.
(i)
Customer may conduct an audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations
                          under this Appendix 1B by requesting and reviewing (1) a certificate issued for security
                          verification reflecting the outcome of an audit conducted by a third party auditor (e.g., SOC 2
                          Type II or ISO/IEC 27001 certification or a comparable certification or other security
                          certification of an audit conducted by a third-party auditor agreed by Customer and Google)
                          within 12 months as of the date of Customer’s request and (2) any other information Google
                          determines is reasonably necessary for Customer to verify such compliance.
(ii)
Alternatively, Google may, at its sole discretion and in response to a request
                          by Customer, initiate a third-party audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations
                          under this Appendix 1B. During such an audit, Google will make available to the third-party
                          auditor all information necessary to demonstrate such compliance. Where Customer requests such
                          an audit, Google may charge a fee (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any audit. Google
                          will provide Customer with further details of any applicable fee, and the basis of its
                          calculation, in advance of any such audit. Customer will be responsible for any fees charged by
                          any third-party auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such audit.
(iii)
Nothing in this Appendix 1B will require Google either to disclose to Customer
                          or its third-party auditor, or to allow Customer or its third-party auditor to access:
(1)
any data of any other customer of a Google Entity;
(2)
any Google Entity’s internal accounting or financial information;
(3)
any trade secret of a Google Entity;
(4)
any information that, in Google's reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise
                            the security of any Google Entity’s systems or premises; or (B) cause any Google Entity to
                            breach its obligations under the US State Privacy Laws or its security and/or privacy
                            obligations to Customer or any third party; or
(5)
any information that Customer or its third party auditor seeks to access for
                            any reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer’s obligations under the US
                            State Privacy Laws.
3.4
Assistance with Impact Assessments.
Google will (taking into account the
                    nature of the processing and the information available to Google) assist Customer in meeting Customer’s (or,
                    where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s) obligations relating to data protection impact
                    assessments and prior regulatory consultations to the extent required under the US State Privacy Laws by:
(a)
providing the Security Documentation;
(b)
providing the information contained in the Agreement (including this Appendix 1B); and

Data Subject Rights.
3.5.1
Responses to Data Subject Requests.
If Google receives a request from
                      a data subject in relation to Customer Personal Data, Customer authorizes Google to, and Google hereby
                      notifies Customer that it will:
(a)
respond directly to the data subject’s request in accordance with the standard
                        functionality of a tool (if any) made available by a Google Entity to data subjects that enables
                        Google to respond directly and in a standardized manner to certain requests from data subjects in
                        relation to Customer Personal Data (for example, online advertising settings or an opt-out browser
                        plugin) (“
Data Subject Tool
”) (if the request is made via a Data Subject Tool); or
(b)
advise the data subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be
                        responsible for responding to such request (if the request is not made via a Data Subject Tool).
3.5.2
Google’s Data Subject Request Assistance.
Google will assist Customer
                      in fulfilling its (or, where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s) obligations under the

                      taking into account the nature of the processing of Customer Personal Data and by:
(a)
providing the functionality of the RDP Services;
(b)
complying with the commitments set out in paragraph 3.5.1 (Responses to Data
                        Subject Requests); and
(c)
if applicable to the RDP Services, making available Data Subject Tools.
3.5.3
Rectification. If Customer becomes aware that any Customer Personal Data is
                      inaccurate or outdated, Customer will be responsible for rectifying or deleting that data if required by
                      the US State Privacy Laws, including (where available) by using the functionality of the RDP Services.
3.6
Subcontractors.
(a)
Customer generally authorizes Google to engage other entities as subcontractors in
                      connection with the provision of the RDP Services. When engaging any subcontractor, Google will:
(i)
ensure via a written contract that: (1) the subcontractor only accesses and uses
                        Customer Personal Data to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it, and
                        does so in accordance with the Agreement (including this Appendix 1B); and (2) if the processing of
                        Customer Personal Data is subject to the US State Privacy Laws, ensure that the data protection
                        obligations in this Appendix 1B are imposed on the subcontractor;
(ii)
when engaging any new subcontractors, provide notice of such new subcontractors
                        where required by US State Privacy Laws, and, where required by US State Privacy Laws, further
                        provide an opportunity for Customer to object to such subcontractors; and
(iii)
remain fully liable for all obligations subcontracted to, and all acts and
                        omissions of, the subcontractor.
(b)
Customer may object to any new subcontractor by terminating the Agreement for
                      convenience immediately upon written notice to Google, on condition that Customer provides such notice
                      within 90 days of being informed of the engagement of the new subcontractor as described in paragraph
                      3.6(a)(ii) herein.
