We will routinely review the content of this Notice and make minor adjustments and corrections as necessary. As required by law, when we make any significant changes that would have an impact on your rights and your Personal Data, we will announce these changes in advance, and make sure you are informed of these changes, which may require us to send you an email announcement.

“MARKETING” – website improvement and performance
We use “Marketing Cookies” provided by our advertising partners to make sure our advertising messages are shown to you at the right time and the right place. These Cookies are persistent but time-limited cookies. These Cookies contain a unique key to distinguish individual users’ browsing habits. We also use these Cookies to limit the number of times a user sees a particular ad on a website and to measure the effectiveness of a particular campaign. The identifier stored by these Cookies are provided by our partners. We cannot use the same identifier in our own systems.
Specifically, they allow us to do the following:
§
3rd-Party Advertising
the technology is used to share your data collected with third-party (non-adidas) advertising platforms and publishers.
For example: sharing information with our partners like facebook so that we can use the data for our ads on facebook – not so facebook can use it for other advertisers or data sellers, etc.
§
Behaviour Tracking
The technology is used to collect your device data, and related web browsing behaviour (e.g. clickstream).
§
Marketing Performance Analytics
The technology is used for tracking a consumer’s behaviour on the site or app for the purposes of improving the performance of our marketing activities.
§
Marketing Precision Analytics
The technology is used to analyse consumer behaviour and preference for more accurate targeted, personalised ads and digital messages, and other marketing ROIs. For example, Ad response rates — where the data is used exclusively for calculating response rates (click-through rates) to improve the effectiveness of advertising purchased on a site external to the destination website.
§
RTB - Real Time Bidding
The technology enables real time bidding (“RTB”).
§
Cross Device Tracking
We use Google Analytics to collect consumer device data, and related web browsing behaviour across devices (e.g. mobile phone / tablet / computer) wherever you can be identified with the same identifier (device ID or Consumer Identifier), for instance by tracking consumers who browse products on our site from a phone, and later return to complete purchases from a tablet or laptop. We do so to improve the effectiveness of our different marketing channels.

The token is valid for 20 minutes if the ‘keep me logged in’ functionality was selected. After the expiration of the token it is no longer possible to access personal information so the logged in session is over.

If this refresh token is missing (if you have not selected persistent login or cookies were cleared) the access token cannot be refreshed. Hence, your session cannot be extended, and you will not be logged in anymore.

This basic profile information will be stored for up to 30 days in the browser that was used for the login within an access token. The access token is a HTTP only cookie. The token is valid for 20 minutes if the ‘keep me logged in’ functionality was selected. After the expiration of the token it is no longer possible to access personal information so the logged in session is over. For persistent login we additionally store a refresh token in the browser which can be used to refresh the access token within a 30 days period and extend the logged in session that way. If this refresh token is missing (if you have not selected persistent login or cookies were cleared) the access token cannot be refreshed. Hence, your session cannot be extended, and you will not be logged in anymore.

We only receive information from the location services about your mobile device entering and leaving our geofences.
Android Device and Google location service

Apple Device and location service
: adidas is notified every time a user moves more than about 500m so we can re-register the regions in order of proximity to users (to get around the limit of 20 regions). We store your last known location temporarily. The information is discarded when the app is closed.

Flash Player
Last updated: May 7, 2012
The
Adobe Privacy Policy
describes the general privacy practices of most of
Adobe’s websites and applications
, including Adobe® Flash® Player software. More privacy-related information for Adobe Flash Player is provided below.
Adobe Flash Player allows you to view and interact with SWF and FLV files (files that are read by Flash Player) created and published across the Internet using your browser or mobile device.
Adobe Flash Player allows authors of SWF and FLV files and the websites hosting those files to use local shared objects (LSOs) (learn more about
LSOs
and
privacy features in Adobe Flash Player
). LSOs can be used in a similar manner as
cookies
, and can be used for a variety of purposes such as keeping track of information you provided and remembering your preferences.
Adobe does not control how content authors and websites hosting SWF or FLV files use LSOs. However, we do provide several privacy features in Flash Player. If you have Adobe Flash Player installed on your computer, Flash Player can be set to reject or delete LSOs in the System Preferences on Mac OS X, in the Flash Player Control Panel on Windows®, or with the
Flash Player management tools available on the Adobe website
so that you can make your own choices about LSOs and other privacy issues.
