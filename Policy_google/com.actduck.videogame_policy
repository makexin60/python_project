FAQs about Privacy Policies & our Privacy Policy Generator
What is a privacy policy?
A privacy policy is a legal document where you disclose what data you collect from users, how you manage the collected data and how you use that data. The important objective of a privacy policy is to inform users how you collect, use and manage the collected.
Is the privacy policy generator free to use?
The Privacy Policy Generator (privacypolicygenerator.info) is a free generator of privacy policies for websites, apps & Facebook pages/app. You can use our free generator to create the privacy policy for your business.
Why is a privacy policy important?
The most important thing to remember is that a privacy policy is required by law if you collect data from users, either directly or indirectly. For example, if you have a contact form on your website you need a privacy policy. But you will also need a privacy policy if you use analytics tools such as Google Analytics.
Where do I put my privacy policy?
Usually, you can find privacy policies in the footer of a website. We recommend that you place your privacy policy in easy to find locations on your website.
What should the privacy policy include?
A standard privacy policy should include: what data you collect from visitors, how you collect it, why you are collecting the data, how you are using the data.
Can I copy someone else's privacy policy?
We do not recommend copying someone else's privacy policy. First of all, privacy policies are copyright-protected legal documents. But most importantly, a privacy policy must be generated based on the exact data you collect. Our privacy policy generator can help you with this.

Privacy Policy FAQ
What exactly is a Privacy Policy?
A Privacy Policy, also known as a Privacy Notice, simply put is the document where the website or app owner discloses what data is being collected from users, how it's being collected and what the owner is doing with that data.
Do I need Privacy Policy for my website?
Yes, it's extremely likely that you need a Privacy Policy for your website. If you collect at least one category of personal information from visitors (let's say, email address or even IP addresses through your website server logs), then the law requires you to have and publicly post a Privacy Policy.
Is a Privacy Policy required by law?
Yes, a Privacy Policy is now a legal requirement in many countries around the world, such as all European countries (GDPR law), USA (through CCPA and CalOPPA laws) and many other countries.
What are the benefits of having a Privacy Policy?
First of all, you won't be breaking the law. A Privacy Policy is legally required for all websites or mobile apps that collect personal information from visitors either directly (ie. asking visitors to provide information) or indirectly (ie. through integration with third parties). Second, visitors will consider you to be trust-worthy as you're transparent with your policies on user information.
How can I generate a Privacy Policy using the Privacy Policy Generator?
It's simple:
Follow the wizard above
Click
Generate
It's done! Your Privacy Policy is now ready.
