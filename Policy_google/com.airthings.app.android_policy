1. The purposes of our data collection and what types of data we collect
Airthings provides Internet-enabled devices (our “Devices”) that are designed to monitor the air quality where installed (e.g., in your home, office, or commercial building). We also provide a mobile application (our “App”) and/or a web dashboard (“Dashboard”) that is designed to work in tandem with our Devices to provide you with information on the indoor air quality in the place(s) where you have installed our Devices. We provide a service through the App and/or Dashboard that is designed to provide you with air quality information and insights about air quality where our Devices are installed (our “Service”). In order to enjoy the full functionality of our Service, we require that you set up an account. In addition, our Service might include making recommendations to you for improving your air quality and making recommendations to you about who to contact to obtain help improving your indoor air.
We collect and process your personal data for various purposes depending on who you are and how we get in touch with you. We collect the following personal data for the purposes mentioned below:
Data type
Purpose
Your name, e-mail address, username, and password when you setup an account.
Administration of your user account. The processing purpose is based on contractual necessity. In other words, we need this information to identify our users and provide them access to a user account with their own credentials to provide the Service.
Device sensor data, including measurements of certain indoor contaminant levels.
As part of the Service, we collect sensor data via the Device to measure air quality and analyze such data, as well as data about the Device, to improve the Service and provide other services, such as Radon Map. All data used in this regard is anonymized and cannot be related to an individual person.
We also may receive or collect data about the Device, such as where it is located (e.g., the postal code and/or street address and/or general location if location services are enabled on the mobile device for the App), a unique ID assigned to each of our Devices, and the name and/or type of Device (e.g., the View Plus monitor). We may associate that information with your account information. We collect this information under the processing purpose of contractual necessity as it is required for us to provide the Service to you.
In addition, anonymized and/or aggregated data may be provided for research on air quality and health, where the processing is based on our or a third party’s legitimate interest for performing the research and any results from research, which we consider to not override the privacy of the data subjects.
App and Dashboard data collection.
As part of the Service, we also collect data about the App and the mobile device where our App is installed and the Dashboard and the device used to access the Dashboard. For example, we will collect the type of mobile device (e.g, iPhone) the operating system of your mobile device, the IP address, the general location if location services are enabled on the mobile device for the App, and a unique ID for your mobile device. We may associate that information with your account information.
We collect this information under the processing purpose of contractual necessity as it is required for us to provide the Service to you.
Name, telephone number, e-mail address and other personal data collected in connection with support enquiries and Service messages.
Responding to incoming enquiries  and sending Service updates through our support channel and web application feedback channel. The processing purpose is based on the legitimate commercial interest of helping you with your enquiry. For SMS Service messages, we only send those if you ask us to do so.
Your name, e-mail address, mobile phone number, username, and information about your mobile device and/or device used to access the Dashboard.
Sending out marketing materials, such as newsletters, email and SMS marketing messages, in-App marketing messaging and information regarding our activities. The processing purpose is based on either your consent (where required by law) or the legitimate commercial interest of helping you better understand how our Devices and related Services can help keep your home safe, including proposals for third-party mitigation solutions and/or contractors that might be available to you.
CV, applications references and attestations.
The recruitment of employment and consulting vacancies and positions. The processing of data is based on your given consent.
We use cookies when you visit our website to obtain information regarding the use of our web pages.

here
.  The processing of cookies is based on the commercial interest of adjusting our web pages for the benefit of users. We ensure your data protection by only using this information for statistical purposes. In these statistics it is not possible to identify you as an individual.
User behaviour on how the user interacts with our webpages and the Airthings app related to a user ID. The user ID may be connected to an identifiable person through other personal data, such as email, user account, purchases etc. As part of the processing, users will be allocated to groups (audiences) based on their behaviour, and the processing of certain data to further detail it, such as behaviour in the webshop.
The data will be used to provide customer support, for product analytics purposes, to personalize experiences, to enhance services, and to optimize communications.  We will use the data to show or exclude ads on other platforms, on social media, email promotions/newsletter content or information on air quality content the user may be interested in based on audiences (e.g. radon), communicate app updates/feature announcements, minimize data and personal data processed and handle data deletion requests more efficiently, and limit user access to sensitive user data. The processing of data is based on your given consent.
2. Disclosure of personal data to others
Airthings has reseller relationships, and if you purchase a Device from a reseller or other company, they may obtain access to the sensor data collected by the Devices. We will notify you via email when you setup your account that a reseller from whom you’ve purchased a Device may be able to view the information collected by your Device(s). We contractually require that any resellers that have access to your personal data only use that personal information to address any air quality issues detected by the Device(s), including offering products and services to you to help you remedy any identified issues and improve your indoor air quality. But please note that any data they receive regarding your Device and/or use of the Service is subject to the reseller’s privacy policy, not ours, and we strongly recommend that you carefully review their privacy policy.
Except as described above, we do not disclose your personal data to others unless there is a legal obligation for such disclosure. Examples as to the basis for disclosure could typically be a contract with you or legal basis in the law instructing us to provide the information. Airthings uses data processors to collect, store or in other ways process data on our behalf. In such cases we have concluded data processing agreements to ensure the information security in all segments of the data processing.
Your personal data might be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (third countries) in order to provide you services and where we use subcontractors. We always make sure that appropriate and suitable safeguards compliant with applicable laws are in place to protect your personal data.
Transfer to third countries will be protected by appropriate safeguards, namely the use of standard data protection clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission.
3. Storage, Retention period
We only store your personal data for as long as necessary for the purpose the data was collected for.
This means that personal data collection based on your consent will be deleted if you withdraw your consent unless we are required to retain all or part of the data under applicable law. Data processed for the purpose of our newsletter will for instance be deleted after withdrawal of your consent.
Personal data we process in the performance of a contract with you will be deleted when the contract is implemented and all obligations pursuant to the contract have been implemented. Personal data related to your user account, including location data, is retained until you delete your account, after such time the data is aggregated and may be stored for up to five years. Personal data related to shipment of packages is deleted after 2 years of last shipping date and then aggregated and stored for up to five years.
