Privacy Policy
Welcome to My True Value and our services.
We are committed to protecting your personal data and your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our services. Please read this privacy policy carefully.
If you choose to use My True Value ApS's Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at our
Terms & Conditions
unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
If you are under 18 years, read the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service with your parents or legal guardian and agree before use.
1. Types of Data Collected
Personal Data
We do not store or save any personal data on external servers.
All data is stored locally on your device.
For example:
- We do not require user registration. We only ask for your first name, which is sufficient to help us personalize your experience. Your first name is stored locally on your device and not on external servers.
- The text you write as part of the app's exercises is stored locally on your device. This means you have 100% ownership of your own data, and we do not store or save any of the data or text you have written.
- If you use the Viqqi AI chatbot, your free text messages (your conversation data) will temporarily be processed by OpenAI to generate replies. OpenAI is a processor and does not save your text messages. Your text messages will be deleted from OpenAI immediately. A summary of your dialogues is saved locally on your device to enable a more relevant chat experience the next time you use the Viqqi AI chatbot. If you inadvertently submit personally identifiable information via text messages, it will be processed by OpenAI but not saved or stored on their servers.
Usage Data
We collect information on how the app is accessed and used. This Usage Data includes information such as your device type, app version, geo-location, pages of our app that you visit, time and date of your visit, time spent on those pages, and other diagnostic data.
Advertising and Tracking
We do not collect data for advertising nor partner with any advertisers.
2. Data Collection Methods
We use standard tracking technologies available through App Store Connect and Google Play Console.
We also use Firebase and Analytics to understand user behavior, such as new user acquisition and returning users.
3. Usage Purpose
The data we collect is used for the following purposes:
- To monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve the experience with the app.
- To identify technical issues and ensure the app's stability and security.
4. Data Retention Period
Data is retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
5. User Rights Regarding Your Personal Data
Right to Access: You are the only one who has access to your personal data. It is stored in the local storage on your device.
Right to Erasure: You can easily delete all your data locally on your phone by, for example, deleting the app or deleting the data from local storage. Note that, depending on your agreement with Apple/Google, they may keep a copy of your storage to enable you to restore data on your device.
6. Data Sharing and Transfers
We do not share your data with third parties.
7. Security Measures
We do not process your personal data as it is saved locally on your device.
8. Cookies
We use cookies on our website to monitor activity. For more details, see our
