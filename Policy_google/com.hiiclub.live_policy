        connections without some data about you, such as basic profile details
        and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information
        generated as you use our services, for example, access logs, as well as
        information from third parties, like when you access our services
        through a social media account. We also collect some data automatically,
        like information about your device and what parts of our Services you
        interact with or spend time using.
2.1 Data You Provide to Us
* The data listed above is stored by us and associated with your account
        in our Services.
●Account Data: In order to use certain features (registering for an
        account), you need to create a user account. When you create or update
        your account, we collect and store the data you provide, like your name,
        gender, and date of birth, and assign you a unique identifying number
        (“Account Data”).
●Profile Data: You can also choose to provide profile information like a
        photo, info, name, sexual interests, or other data. Your Profile Data
        will be publicly viewable by others unless you delete your account. To
        add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access
        your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to
        provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in a certain
        jurisdiction, for example, your racial or ethnic origins, sexual
        orientation, and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this
        information, you consent to our processing of that information.
●Usage Data: When you use our Services and features, we collect certain
        data including; messages, follow information, photos, videos, and other

        Services.
●Shared Content: Parts of the Services let you interact with other users
        or share content publicly, including by videos you post and the data you

        or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or

●Data About Your Accounts on Other Services: We may obtain certain
        information through your social media or other online accounts if they
        are connected to your account in our Services. If you login to our
        Services via Facebook or another third-party platform, we ask for your
        permission to access certain information about that other account. For
        example, depending on the platform or service we may collect your name,
        profile picture, gender, info, and birthday.
Those platforms and services make information available to us through
        their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you
        (via your privacy settings) or the platform or service decide to give
        us.
If you access or use our Services through a third-party platform or
        service, or click on any third-party links, the collection, use, and
        sharing of your data will also be subject to the privacy policies and
        other agreements of that third party.

        platforms. We only receive a receipt of your transaction provided by
        these platforms. For security reasons, we do not collect or store
        sensitive cardholder data, such as full credit card numbers or card
        authentication data.
●Communications and Support: If you contact us for support or to report
        a problem or concern (regardless of whether you have created an
        account), we collect and store your contact information, messages, and

        operating system, IP address, and any other data you provide or that we
        collect through automated means (which we cover below). We use this data
        to respond to you and research your question or concern, in accordance
        with this Privacy Policy. If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise
        process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send
        an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the
        information about others that you give us in order to complete your
        request.
●Sensitive Information: Please be careful about posting sensitive
        details about yourself on your Profile such as your religious
        denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this
        information to us when you create your Profile, including your sexual
        preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so.
        Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on our
        Services may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do
        upload and choose to tell us sensitive data about yourself, you are
        explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this
        public to other users.

        Services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such
        collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your
        geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may

        ability to opt-out of cookies, and the collection of your data by
        certain analytics providers. You can update or terminate your account
        from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights

● Access / Update tools in the service: Tools and account settings that
        help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to
        us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service.

        specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and
        location services as well as push notifications. You can change your
        settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of
        the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding

        functionality.
● Deletion: You can delete your account by using the corresponding
        functionality directly on the service.
We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key
        points to remember:
●Reviewing your information: Applicable privacy laws may give you the
        right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on
        the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of
        portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of
        your personal information by sending us an email at aufihan@gmail.com.
● Updating your information: If you believe that the information we hold
        about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and
        want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing,
        please contact us via aufihan@gmail.com.
For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask
        you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
        requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons,
        including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade
        secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you
        wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of
        any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other
        user will have to contact us to provide their written consent before the
        information is released.
Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to
        the processing of personal information, notably where such requests
        would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance,
        we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.
●Uninstall: You can stop all information collected by an app by
        uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If
        you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier
        associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you
        re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to
        re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and
        activities.
●Accountability: In certain countries, including in the European Union,
        you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data
        protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your
        personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a
        complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you
        work or where we are established.
If you want to exercise any of your rights listed above please visit our
        feedback form or email us at aufihan@gmail.com.
6. To delete your account
Open HiiclubPro App and log in, Tap Me > Settings > Delete account >
        Confirm to delete your account. or Visit HiiclubPro official Website
https://www.hiiclub.live/
, Click “Delete Account” > Log in
        > Confirm to delete your account.
Subject to satisfaction and/or waiver of the conditions for deletion as
        set out above, the Account will be deleted immediately upon your
        request.
You understand and agree that after the Account is deleted, all
        information and balance in the Account will be cleared and cannot be
        restored.
7. Data Retention
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for
        legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. To
        protect the safety and security of our users on and off our Services, we
        implement a safety retention window of no longer than six months
        following account deletion unless there is a technical difficulty.
        During this period, some of your account information will be retained
        although the account will of course not be visible on the Services
        anymore. In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon the
        deletion of your account (following the safety retention window) or
        after a period of no longer than 5 years of continuous inactivity. An
        account is considered inactive when the Application of the Member has
        not established contact with HiiclubPro’s servers (including due to
        deactivation of the geolocation process), and the Member has not used
        the Application. In any event, the Account of a Premium Member is not
        considered inactive.
Unless:
●we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some
        “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data
        retention obligations) as well as to prevent bot systems that are
        abusing the system;
●we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for
        instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy, and other
        similar consents are kept for five years);
●there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep
        the relevant information until it is resolved
●the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests,
        such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For
        example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was
        banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new
        account.
Anonymized information about activity on our Services is retained for
        longer periods of time for statistical and product research purposes but
        this is not attributable to an individual once the profile has been
        deleted. Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry
        out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot
        promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due
        to technical constraints.
8. Data Protection and Security
● We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration,
        disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all
        technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information,
        we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
        information will always remain secure. Your password is an important
        part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect
        it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if you
        believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change
        it immediately and contact aufihan@gmail.com with any concerns. We
        regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks
        and regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing
        practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security
        measures. We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without
        notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe
        that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us
        immediately. We are not responsible for virus protection outside our
        service network. We are also not responsible for the damage or
        destruction of user data. We will pursue every detected attack by
        hackers, etc. under civil law and, if necessary, by the prosecution.
9. Children’s Privacy
Our Services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older.
        We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not
        knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18.
        If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the
        reporting mechanism available through the service. If we become aware
        that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us
        and provided us with personal data, we will take steps to terminate that
        person’s registration and delete their profile information from our
        Services. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children
        rule, we may retain basic account and profile information to ensure that
        you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new profile.

        place. If you want more information relating to the nature of the
        safeguards we have in place please email aufihan@gmail.com.
