This Privacy Policy covers what EXU(HK) Limited (“Camsea” “Camsea Platform” “Platform” “Services” “we”
            “our”) does with the Personal Information (as defined herein) that you share with us and the data we collect
            when you are accessing our Platform and/or our Services. Personal Information about our users is an integral
            part of our business, so please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using or accessing our Platform
            and/or our Services, you agree to the privacy policies outlined below.
What Does this Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers Camsea's treatment of Personal Information that
              we collect while you are using the Platform and the Services. This policy does not apply to the practices
              of third parties that Camsea does not own or control, including but not limited to third-party services
              you access through Camsea, the Platform and/or our Services, or to individuals that Camsea does not employ
              or manage. As our Services integrate with third-party sites, and other sites and social networks, we
              assume that you are already aware of the privacy policies of those other sites and networks when using our
              Platform and/or our Services and when you allow us to interact with these sites and networks on your
              behalf.
The Service

            communicate online through various media, including text, video, linking, and accessing third-party social
            network platforms such as but not limited to Snapchat (collectively, the “Services”).

Information We Collect
There are three basic ways we collect information:
- Information you choose to give us
- Information we get when you use our services
- Information we get from third parties
Here
’
s a few more details on each of these categories.
Information You Choose to Give Us
By visiting and interacting with Camsea, its Platform and/or
              its
              Services, you provide us with Personal Information which may include, but is not limited to, the
              following:
- Personally Identifiable Information: may include, without limitation,
                  the information provided when you register to use the Platform and/or the Services, including your
                  name, profile picture, date of birth, phone number, phone book content, email address, gender, age,
                  birthday, and friend list, and/or other social network usernames and ‘likes' and preferences, friend
                  lists and the number of friends you have via social networks, messages to other users of the Platform
                  and the Services, use information regarding your use of the Services, profile picture that you upload
                  via the Platform and/or our Services, and browser information.
- The information you choose to provide above may be shared with your
                  contacts on our service. You have total control over your profile information and you can access to
                  modify at any time. Your Profile is available to other users of the Services who are connected to you
                  on our service. In addition, unless you opt-out (which you may do so at any time in the settings of
                  our Platform), your Profile is discoverable by other users. You may choose to “block” any user on our
                  platform to prevent unwanted access of your Personal Information.
- You may also choose to share your mobile device’s Contacts list with
                  us (including names, numbers, emails, Apple ID, etc), and we will store it on our servers to help you
                  better improve our service, e.g. connect with friends on our service. If you do not want us to store
                  this information, you may opt out through your account settings or notify us via email. If done so, we
                  will not be able to offer some of the features of our service.
Of course, you’ll also provide us with whatever information you send through the services. Keep in mind that
            the
            users you send texts, images, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the
            Platform. So, the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Camsea as well: Don’t
            send
            messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.
It probably goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: When you contact Camsea Support or communicate
            with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.
Information We Get When You Use Our Services
When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve
            used them. We might know, for instance, that you used one of the filter in Platform and the number of times
            you
            have used this filter. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our
            services:
Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. We may collect
            information including but not limited to:
- How you interact with the services, such as which filters you view or
                  the number of times you apply to discover.
- Content created when using the service. It includes creating or
                  uploading different kinds of content to the Platform, including, without limitation, photos, text,
                  messages,
                  posts, html, URLs, pictures, video, and other content (collectively,
“
User
                  Contributed Content
”
), and the metadata that is provided with the content. As you upload User
                  Contributed Content you should be mindful of your privacy as well as the privacy of others.
- How you communicate with other Camsea users, such as their names, the
                  time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which
                  friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you
                  open a message or capture a screenshot). We allow you to share text messages, photos, screenshots,
                  videos, and other forms of communication on our services with other users, and if you choose to do so,
                  your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos, and other communications may be stored on our
                  servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other users, we may not be able to
                  remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Your
                  decision is to send and share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos, or other communications on
                  our service. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be
                  able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available. We are not
                  responsible for any use or misuse of the information you share.
- Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as
                  the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers,
                  unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, none direct display of content
                  moderation, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).
- User content e.g. photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials
                  that you create on the Platform, may also be collected. Your photos and videos may be captured by
                  other users on the service, and those content can be stored and used by us or third party services for
                  content moderation and community safety monitoring purposes. You can change third-party sharing
                  options or write to us directly in our product settings.

                  friends, we may

                  information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your
general
location using
                  methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such
                  as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.
-Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most
                  online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web
                  beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity,
                  browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with
                  services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to
                  accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the
                  settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could
                  affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we use cookies and
                  your choices, please check out our Cookie Statement. To learn more about how third parties use these
                  technologies on our services, be sure to read the Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by
                  Others section of our privacy policy.

                  respond to you.
Information We Collect from Third Parties
We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use
              our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device
              phonebook
—
and you
’
re one of
              that user
’
s contacts
—
we may
              combine the information we collect from that user
’
s phonebook
              with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other companies
              that are owned or operated by us, or any other third-party sources, and combine that with the information
              we collect through our services.
How We Use Information
We provide you with an amazing set of products and services
              that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:
- Develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products
                  and services.
- Communicate with you.
- Monitor and analyze trends and usage.
- Personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or
                  profile information, or customizing the content we show you, including ads.
- Enhance the safety and security of our products and services.
- Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or
                  illegal activity.
- Use the information we
’
ve
                  collected from cookies and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with
                  them.
- Enforce our Terms of Services and other usage policies.
We may also store some information locally on your device.
              For example, we may store information as a local cache so that you can open the Platform and view content
              faster.
How We Share Information
In certain instances, we may share your personal information
              with third-party service providers to further improve and optimize our service for you. We may share
              information about you in the following ways:
- With other users. We may share the following information with other
                  users
- Information about you, such as your username and name;
- Information about how you have interacted with the services, such as
                  the names of users you are friends with, and other information that will help users understand your
                  connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new
                  friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have
                  Camsea friends in common;
- Any additional information you have consented for us to share. For
                  example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other
                  users who have your phone number in their device phonebook;
- With all users and the general public. We may share the following
                  information with all users as well as the general public:
- Public information like your profile pictures that you submit to
                  Local. If a Local service is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, it may be viewed by
                  the public at large.
- With our affiliates, we may share information with entities within the
                  Camsea family of companies.
- With third parties, we may share your information with the following
                  third parties:
- With service providers, sellers, and partners. We may share
                  information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, sellers that provide
                  goods through our services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.
- With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about
                  you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
- Comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable
                  law, rule, or regulation;
- Investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Services
                  violations;
- Protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others;
                  or detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.
- With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If Camsea gets
                  involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some
                  portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and
                  after the transaction closes.
- In the aggregate or after de-identification. We may also share with
                  third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be
                  used to identify you.
You expressly agree that the information provided when you
              register the Platform and/or the content your created when using the Platform (including, without
              limitation, photos, text, messages, posts, html, URLs, pictures, video, and other content), may be
              recorded, stored, published and made available to the rest of Camsea users. Furthermore, other users may
              follow you on the Platform, and your followers can see, for example, the user-contributed content that you
              have uploaded to the Platform. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other
              individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think
              carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in the information you provided or
              content that you create in the Platform.
Your information may also be stored and process in any
              country in which we provide service to due to server facilities and third-party service teams. By using
              our service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
If you do not agree with all of the terms of this Privacy
              Policy, please do not use our service. Community safety is our number one priority and some of the above
              user information are mandatory in order to create a safe community for all users.
Information You Choose to Share with Third Parties
The services may also contain third-party links and search
              results, include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service
              that
’
s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to
              those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you
              may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both.
              You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your
              information. To the extent that you use a profile that may be available to others on our Services, you are
              solely responsible for its content and accuracy at all times. As always, we encourage you to review the
              privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third
              parties you interact with through our services.
How Long We Keep Your Content
Finally
—
and this is important
—
you should understand that users who see the content you provide
              can always save it using any number of techniques: screenshots, in-Platform functionality, or any other
              image-capture technology. It
’
s also possible, as with any digital information, that someone
              might be able to access messages forensically or find them in a device
’
s temporary storage. If any deletion of user information of our
              Platform happens, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. And we may also
              retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.
How we protect Your Information
Protecting user privacy and personal information is a top
              priority for us. We process your personal information to improve and enforce our security measures, combat
              spam, malware, malicious activities, or security risks, and to monitor and verify your identity so that
              unauthorized users do not access your account with us. Access to any user information is restricted to our
              employees, contractors, agents, and third-party service providers ONLY, who need to know the information
              in order to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support, and optimize our service experience and
              security. We use password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality
              and security of all user information. Due to the inherent nature of the internet and related technology,
              we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against loss, misuse, or
              alteration.
Control over Your Information
We want you to be in control of your information, so we
              provide you with the following tools.
- Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and control the
                  personal information that we have about you. There are limits, though, to the requests we
’
ll
                  accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request
                  risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful. You can access and update your account information
                  right in the Platform by visiting the Platform
’
s
                  Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information that we may
                  have, you can put in a request here. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify
                  your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal
                  information. You can also remove our service from your mobile device or process account
                  deletion.
- Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing
                  ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your
                  phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the
                  settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain
                  services may lose full functionality.
- Account Deletion.
You can
                    remove your data anytime you want.
Account deletion can be accessed within the Platform. Upon
                  your request, we will temporarily disable your account to prepare for removal. During this time, you
                  can cancel your deletion request, and we will resume your account. Upon the end of 30 days, we will
                  use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers. Please note, that some
                  information may remain in archived/backup copies for legal purposes or required by law (for instance,
                  some “traffic data” may be kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations).
Data Removal
You can choose to remove your data anytime you want. If you
              ask us to delete your account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our
              servers, subject to any applicable legal or other requirements to maintain certain records of your
              personally identifiable data. Please note that the deletion of your personally identifiable data from our
              database may result in us not being able to provide you with the Services.
If you need to delete any data or personal information that
              we may have, you can simply tap “Me-Settings-About Camsea-Delete Account”, but we may ask you to verify
              your identity or provide additional information before we let you delete your personal information.

As is customary on all websites, this site also makes use of
              cookies, small text files that allow you to store information on visitor preferences, to improve the
              functionality of the site, to simplify navigation by automating the procedures (es, login, site language)
              and for the analysis of the use of the site. Session cookies are essential to distinguish between the
              connected users. They are helpful to avoid a required feature that can be provided to the wrong user and
              for security purposes to prevent cyber attacks on the site. Session cookies do not contain personal data
              and last only for the current session, i.e., until the browser is closed. No consent is required from
              them. The functionality cookies used by the site are strictly necessary for the use of the site; in
              particular, they are linked to an express request of functionality by the user, for which no consent is
              required. By using the site, the visitor expressly consents to the use of cookies.
What do we use cookies for?
Like other providers of online services, we use cookies to
              provide,
              secure,
              and improve our services, including by remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our
              website, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns, and personalizing and tailoring ads to your
              interests. To accomplish these purposes, we also may link information from cookies with other personal
              information we hold about you.

              functions like helping us understand how much traffic our marketing campaigns drive on our services,
              preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for
              advertisers, selecting advertisements relevant to you, and measuring the number of ads displayed and their
              performance, such as how many people interacted with a given ad.

There are several cookie managements options available to
              you. Please note that changes you make to your cookie preferences may make using our services a less
              satisfying experience as they may not be as personalized to you. In some cases, you may even find yourself
              unable to use all or part of our services. You can set and adjust your cookie preferences at any time by
              using the tool available on our website or by heading to your account settings and adjusting your app

How We Share Personal Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions Involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings.

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training.

Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

Privacy-Centric Innovation
AppsFlyer places privacy as a core value and as such, is heavily committed to, and invested in, developing innovative privacy preserving technology and privacy-forward controls. AppsFlyer’s overarching goal is to create solutions that enable the highest standards of privacy while maintaining business excellence.
Privacy preserving technologies include:
Aggregated Advanced Privacy (AAP)
a feature that empowers advertisers to prevent the availability of user-level attribution data.
Privacy Cloud and Data Clean Room
two products that innovate collaboration and measurement by ensuring the highest standards of privacy-preserving technologies.
SKAdNetwork, Conversion Studio, and Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
advanced solutions that enable advertisers to thrive on iOS.
Predictive Analytics
a statistical technique that leverages machine learning for measurement insights.
Incrementality measurement
a feature that measures the incremental lift generated by remarketing campaigns.
The above technologies are a selection of our products that are at the forefront of privacy-preserving innovation.
AppsFlyer’s products and features enable the highest standards of privacy-centric technology.
Privacy-forward controls include:
Opt-in/Opt out for any data processing
– This enables customers to align with any consent mechanisms implemented within their app to ensure GDPR,
CCPA
or other regulatory compliance.
Opt-out from Device ID utilization (iOS -IDFA, iOS – IDFV and Android). For iOS customers may also use the Strict Mode SDK. This enables alignment with any platform policies and regulatory requirements for child directed or mixed audience applications.
Opt-out controls for customer data sharing with partners
(see also AAP for iOS for aggregated data sharing). This enables customers to comply with platform policies and regulatory requirements including requirements related to child or mixed audience applications (e.g COPPA).
Opt-in/out controls on types of data shared for in-app events
– this enables customers to control with which partners (if any at all) customers share events they choose to measure.
IP address masking
– This will mask IP addresses from any reporting and from any data customers choose to share with their partners.
Post Install deidentification
– This enables customers to measure post install events without connection to the device identifier and to the initial attribution. Other identifiers such as IP and AppsFlyer ID are hashed.
For more information on privacy preserving controls, please visit our
help center
.
Data Subject Request Management
We have developed a comprehensive range of tools to help our customers build a fully compliant stack. By adopting our tools, brands can address data subject requests across their partner ecosystems, in near real-time.

This typically includes storage vendors, internet carriers and payment processing partners.
Legally Binding and Legal-Related Disclosures
We will disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law within United States’ jurisdiction, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with the United States’ state and federal laws), in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement.

3. Your Rights and Choices
Your Privacy
Depending on your jurisdiction and applicable data protection legislation, you have the right to exercise a number of privacy rights under certain circumstances.
Such privacy rights depend on your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of our Enterprise Customer’s (Controller) privacy policy. You can obtain information about the applicable privacy rights, and how to exercise them, from the relevant Enterprise Customer’s privacy policy. If we receive any privacy right request directly from you, we will forward it to the relevant Enterprise Customer, that is the data controller.
Children's Privacy
Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. Our Enterprise Customers may incorporate our Service into their products to provide services to children under the age of 16. In that case, it is our Enterprise Customers’ obligation and responsibility to obtain parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 16 years of age deploys the Service within a Customer Application, then you may contact such Customer Application provider to delete your child’s Personal Information.
4. Data Security
We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Information in our possession.
Additionally, Agora Voice, Video, Signaling and Chat SDKs provide built-in encryption algorithms as well as support for other encryptions that our Enterprise Customers prefer. The communication between you and the Agora network (i.e., SD-RTN
TM
) is protected by encrypted transmission protocols such as the Agora Private Transmission Protocol, Transport Layer Security (TLS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS). In the case of Chat, the communication between you and our leased servers is protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS), and stored data is protected by AWS S3 storage encryption and/or AES 256 file encryption. Chat also supports end-to-end encryption via third-party extensions, at our Enterprise Customers’ choice and control.
We strongly recommend our Enterprise Customers to follow the guidance in our Security Best Practices and to encrypt the User Content where necessary.  As your content is encrypted, Agora is not able to read the encrypted content, nor are we able to relate it to you.

Meta Platform Terms
1. Introduction
a. The Meta for Developers Platform (“Platform”) is the set of APIs, SDKs, tools, plugins, code, technology, content, and services that enables others, including app developers and website operators, to develop functionality, retrieve data from Meta and any other
Meta Products
, or provide data to us.
b. To use Platform (including to Process any Platform Data), you agree to these Platform Terms (“Terms”), as well as all other applicable terms and policies. This may include the
Meta Terms of Service
, the
Instagram Terms of Use
, the
Meta Commercial Terms
, the
Business Tools Terms
, and any
Meta Product
terms that are applicable.
c. You must also comply with the applicable requirements in our
Developer Policies
and those made available on our
Developer Site
, including in our
Documentation
(collectively, the “Developer Docs”) and all applicable laws and regulations, including with respect to your collection, use, or other processing of Platform Data.
d. These Terms will start when you accept them or otherwise start accessing or using Platform, whichever date is earlier. If you are accepting these Terms or accessing or using Platform on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms and you agree on behalf of such entity to be bound by these Terms (and for clarity, all other references to “you” in these Terms refer to such entity).
e. If you fail to comply with these Terms or any other applicable terms or policies, we may suspend or terminate your App or account, as described below.
f. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein (including in Section 12 (“Glossary”) have the meaning given in our other terms and policies, including our
Terms of Service
and our
Meta Commercial Terms
.  The term “including” means “including without limitation.”
2. Intellectual Property Rights

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and all other applicable terms and policies, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except to Service Providers as described below), non-transferable, non-assignable license to use, access, and integrate with Platform, but only to the extent permitted in these Terms and all other applicable terms and policies. You will not sell, transfer, or sublicense Platform to anyone. Except as expressly licensed herein, you will not use, access, integrate with, modify, translate, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, or otherwise exploit Platform or any aspect thereof. The
Meta Companies
reserve all rights, title, and interest (including the right to enforce any such rights) not expressly granted in these Terms.

i.
Your Content:
1. You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to: host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of any information, data, and other content made available by you or on your behalf (including by your Service Providers or through your App) in connection with Platform (collectively, “Your Content”) for any business purpose in connection with operating, providing, or improving Platform or any other
Meta Product

3. If you owned Your Content before providing it to us, you will continue owning it after providing it to us, subject to any rights granted in these Terms or any other applicable terms or policies and any access you provide to others by sharing it via Platform.
ii.

You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to: host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your App for any business purpose in connection with operating, providing, or improving Platform.  This license remains in effect even if you stop using Platform. Without limitation, the foregoing license includes the right to frame or link to your App, to place content (including ads) around your App, and to analyze your App (including to assess your compliance with these Terms and all other applicable terms and policies).

iii. If your App contains content submitted or provided by your Users or other third parties, you must have an appropriate notice and takedown process and otherwise comply with all applicable laws and regulations to respond to notices of claimed infringement.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.

Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Security practices
To keep personal data safe, Firebase employs extensive security measures to
minimize access:
Firebase restricts access to a select employees who have a business purpose to access personal data.
Firebase logs employee access to systems that contain personal data.
Firebase only permits access to personal data by employees who sign in with Google Sign-In and
2-factor authentication
.
