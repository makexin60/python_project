Collection and Use of Primary Account Information
1. Collection of Information: Our app collects the email address associated with your primary Google Play account. This collection occurs only once during the initial setup or at the time of account registration within the app. The purpose of this data collection is strictly limited to enhancing your user experience and improving our app’s functionality.
2. Anonymisation: To ensure your privacy and security, your email address is anonymised before it is stored. Anonymisation transforms your email into a unique, fixed-size hash value, which is a non-reversible process. This means that the original email address cannot be derived from the anonymised hash, thereby protecting your personal information.
3. Use of Collected Information: The primary purpose of using your encoded email address is to associate it with our in-app purchase hub. This connection enables us to streamline and personalize the transaction process, ensuring a seamless and secure experience when you make in-app purchases. It allows us to verify transactions, manage purchases, and provide customer support related to these transactions. We do not use your email address for unsolicited communication, nor do we share or sell this information to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.
Service Providers
We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
To facilitate our service;
To provide the service on our behalf;
To perform service-related maintenance; or
To assist us in analyzing how our service is used.
The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, therefore we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do the necessary actions.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
