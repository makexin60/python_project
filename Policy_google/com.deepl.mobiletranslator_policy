2. Scope of Data Protection
Data protection applies to personal data as defined by the GDPR, i.e. all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

3. Texts, Translations and Improvements - DeepL Translator / Write (free version)
When using our
free services
, please only enter content that you wish to transfer to our services. The transmission of this content is necessary in order for us to provide the translation or improvement and offer you our service. We process the content you upload and their translations or improvements for a limited period of time to train and improve our neural networks and algorithms. This also applies to corrections you make to our translation or improvement suggestions. If you use the glossary feature within our free services without a DeepL account and enter certain pairs of terms there, this data is only stored locally and is not forwarded to DeepL. Therefore, you cannot use your glossary entries in another browser or on another device. If you use the glossary feature while being logged into your DeepL account, glossaries may be forwarded to DeepL.
Please note that according to its
Terms of Use
, you may not use DeepL Translator / Write for the translation or improvement of texts containing personal data of any kind.The translation or improvement of personal data is only possible as part of a DeepL Pro subscription (please see sections
4
and
5
).
4. Texts and Improvements – DeepL Translator Pro / DeepL API Pro / DeepL Write Pro
When using our services DeepL Translator Pro, DeepL API Pro and DeepL Write Pro to translate or improve texts, the texts or documents you submit will not be permanently stored and will only be kept temporarily to the extent necessary for the production and transmission of the translation or improvement. After complete performance of the contractually agreed services all submitted texts or documents and their translations or improvements will be deleted. When using these services, your texts will not be used to improve the quality of our services. For further information on the processing of your data within a DeepL Pro subscription, please refer to section 6 of this privacy policy and our
Terms and Conditions
.
Please note that using DeepL Translator Pro, DeepL API Pro and DeepL Write Pro for the translation or improvement of texts containing personal data of any kind is only permitted if there is a justification for this under data protection law. Therefore, our Ts&Cs provide for the conclusion of a data processing agreement (see section 8.1.3 ofDeepL Pro
Terms and Conditions
). To enter into such an agreement, please contact sales(at)deepl.com.
5. DeepL Voice
When using the DeepL Voice services, the audio data of the users will be processed to provide our translation services. The processing includes the transcription and translation of the audio data.
After complete performance of the contractually agreed services the audio data, their transcriptions and the translations will be deleted. For DeepL Voice for Conversations transcribed and translated audio data will be stored in the local storage on the customer's side to guarantee a seamless performance of the services. The content in the local storage will be deleted by closing the DeepL app. For further information on the processing of your data within a DeepL Pro subscription, please refer to section 6 of this privacy policy and our
Terms and Conditions
.
When providing our Voice services to customers, we act in our capacity as processor. Your data will therefore be processed on the basis of the data processing agreement entered into with our customers. To enter into such an agreement, please contact sales(at)deepl.com.
For DeepL Voice for Meetings we use third party cloud services to be able to integrate our bot application in the Microsoft Teams app. The cloud services are provided by Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, D18 P521 Dublin 18, Ireland (“Microsoft”) or Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg (AWS). The cloud services will only be used to host our bot application and forward the audio data to our infrastructure. Neither will the transcription or translation be happening on Microsoft or AWS servers, nor will we store any data on Microsoft or AWS servers for this purpose. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Microsoft and AWS and Microsoft and AWS may only process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes. Further information on the handling of personal data at Microsoft can be found

6. Creating a DeepL account and Signing up for a DeepL Pro Subscription
6.1 Creating a DeepL account
You have the option of creating a DeepL account. You can use the DeepL Translator or DeepL Write via this account within the applicable
DeepL Account Terms and Conditions
(please see also section
3
). To create the account, the following personal data will be stored:
E-mail address
Password
IP address
We process the email address and password on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR in order to perform the contract of use. Your IP address is processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interests to match your IP address with IP addresses that have misused our service in the past for fraud prevention purposes.
Please note that the creation of a DeepL account is a prerequisite for signing up for and using a DeepL Pro subscription (see section
6.2
), but creating a DeepL account does not oblige you to purchase a paid subscription. Even if you do not sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription after creating the account, the DeepL account remains available and you can use it. You can delete your DeepL account at any time within the account settings or by sending an e-mail with your request to support(at)deepl.com.
If you use your business email address for creating an account with DeepL, we may share this email address with the holder of the company email domain associated with your email address. We will only do this, if the company has legitimate reasons to ask for this data e.g., is interested in purchasing DeepL Pro licenses for the whole company and has confirmed to us that email addresses under their company email domain may only be used for business purposes and may not be used for private purposes. In some cases, sharing of data may also include sharing of usage data associated with your account to allow the company to assess their specific need on DeepL Pro licenses. The sharing of this data is in DeepL's legitimate interest to best support our customers in the acquisition, roll-out and adoption of our paid services, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
If your company uses Single Sign-On (SSO) to log in to DeepL, there is no need for a separate registration with DeepL. When you log in via Single Sign-On your company transmits your email address as well as your first and last name directly to us. We also process this data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.
6.2 Signing up for DeepL Pro
If, after creating a DeepL account, you sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription, additionally the following personal data will be collected and processed for the purposes of concluding and fulfilling the contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR):
First name, surname, and where applicable, company name
Address
Payment details
Tax numbers (where applicable)
Selected subscription option
Possibly other, additional data you provided during the registration process.
Your payment details will also be processed by us if you initially sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription with a free trial period. Despite the free trial period, the processing of your payment details is already necessary at the time of the formation of the contract within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR, as a DeepL Pro subscription is in principle a paid subscription and we only in some cases allow our customers to test our products free of charge for a trial period. However, if no cancellation is made within the aforementioned trial period, the subscription will automatically continue to be subject to payment and the method of payment specified by you will be debited at the time stated in the booking process.
In addition to the aforementioned data, we process further (usage-)data relevant for the provision and billing of our service, such as subscription ID, date and time of the subscription conclusion, billing period, successful payment processing, logins, number of translated or improved characters and documents, upgrades and downgrades. The processing and storage of the aforementioned data is necessary for the conclusion of the contract as well as its performance and is therefore justified according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. If you yourself are not a party to the contract, but DeepL Pro is provided to you, e.g. by your employer or an organization to which you belong, we justify the processing of the data mentioned in section 6.1 and the aforementioned usage data via Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is necessary for the performance of the business relationship with our customers, i.e. your employer or your organization.
We store the data for the duration of the contract term and subsequently, if applicable, for the duration of statutory retention periods, insofar as these prescribe the retention for the respective types of data. We will delete your account if you wish to do so after canceling your subscription. Otherwise, we will maintain your account as DeepL account (see section
6.1
) so that it is available to you in the event of a renewed subscription without you having to register again. This is in your as well as in our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
6.3 Processors involved in the DeepL Pro checkout process
In order to process payments, we forward the necessary payment data to our authorized payment service provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd., Block 4, Harcourt Centre, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Stripe”). Where necessary, Stripe will transfer the data to Stripe, Inc., located in the USA. Further information on data protection at Stripe and compliance with the requirements of Art. 44 GDPR can be found
here
and
here
. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Stripe, which allows Stripe to process the data solely in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes.
In addition, we use the fraud prevention services of Riskified Ltd, 30 Kalisher St., Tel-Aviv, 6525724, Israel (“Riskified”). Riskified’s service helps us to detect and analyse fraud in online transactions. This enables us to prevent fraudulent activity and misuse of our services.
When you purchase DeepL Pro services on our website, DeepL may transmit data like your first name, last name, billing address, email address, the DeepL service you booked, its price, your IP address, a truncated form of your payment data (for credit cards this is the BIN, the last four digits of the credit card and the bank issuing the card, for SEPA payments this is the bank code and the last 4 digits from your IBAN) to Riskified for verification purposes. Riskified also directly collects and processes your IP address and information on your device and on your behaviour in our checkout process as well as an identifier via its beacon, a Java script that is implemented in the DeepL check process. Riskified analyses these various data points and provides us with an assessment of whether a transaction is to be considered safe or likely to be fraudulent. More information on the logic typically involved in such an analysis can be found
here
. If Riskified assesses a payment as fraudulent, we may automatically decline your request to subscribe to DeepL Pro. This is justified, because this fraud analysis is necessary for entering into a contract with us. In case you receive an error message, but consider the decision not correct, you can reach out to support(at) deepl.com at any time and one of our support agents will review your case.
We will also feed back user data to Riskified if Riskified has provided us with a positive assessment and we have concluded and executed the contract, but the transaction is subject to a chargeback or the debit on the specified means of payment is not successful after the end of the trial period.
The inclusion of Riskified's fraud prevention services and the related data processing described above is necessary for our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR for the prevention of fraud in order to verify the legitimacy of payments made via DeepL’s checkout process.
Riskified processes the data we transfer to them and the data they collect in our checkout process for their own purposes. The data may be transferred to the USA. You can find more information about Riskified's handling of personal data here:
https://www.riskified.com/privacy/
.
6.4 Processing of usage data
In your account in the section “usage”, you can also view data about your usage behavior e.g., - depending on your subscription - the number of characters translated or improved in the past or the number of documents translated. If you have a consumption-based subscription, such as the DeepL API Pro, you can also view the monthly costs incurred. We justify this data processing via Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as it is necessary for the performance of the contract, in particular for billing purposes or for managing the number of documents still available for translation. Insofar as the processing goes beyond what is necessary for the performance of the contract, we base the processing on our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as we seek to meet our customers' wish to visualize information on usage behavior in a transparent manner. The graphical representation of the development of consumption over the contract period is considered to be also in the interest of our customers.
If you yourself are not a party to the DeepL Pro subscription, but access to our products is provided to you by your employer or an organization to which you belong, we may share data about your usage of the subscription (e.g. number of translated characters and documents across the DeepL products, last session and last usage date) with your employer or organization. Providing this data corresponds to our legitimate interests as well as the legitimate interests of our customers in receiving the information they need about the use of the subscription they have paid for, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
6.5 Processing of the Submitted Texts and Translations / Improvements
As contractually agreed, we process the content you submit to DeepL Pro and their translations or improvements only temporarily, insofar as this is necessary for the creation and transmission of the translation or improvement. This processing is therefore justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. The content you submit and the translations or improvements will - within the framework of the contractual agreements and as stated in section
4
and
5
- will be deleted after the performance of the contractually agreed service. This does not apply, if you use the "saved translations" or glossary feature. In this case, content provided by you, including translations, will be stored for your account and kept accessible for you at all times. When you use the “saved translations” feature in our mobile apps, your texts and translations are stored locally.
This data processing is necessary for the performance of our contract and is therefore justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.
7. Translation of Documents
7.1 Translation of Documents with DeepL Translator and DeepL Pro
You can translate documents in different file formats both with DeepL Pro (.docx, .pptx, .html, .pdf and .txt) as well as with DeepL Translator (.docx, .pptx and .pdf). When using document translation in DeepL Translator, section
3
of this privacy policy applies. If you translate documents of the file types mentioned above while you are logged in to your DeepL Pro account, the texts you submit will only be processed temporarily and will be deleted after the completion of the translation process, including the translations themselves (see also section
4
and
6.3
of this privacy policy). With both DeepL Pro and DeepL Translator, the translation of your documents will be provided exclusively by DeepL and processed on our infrastructure in the EEA.
7.2 Temporary Storage of Metadata when Translating Documents
Regardless of whether you use our paid or free service when translating documents, particularly the following data is stored for each translation process:
Status/progress of the translation process
Document file type
Selected language pair for translation
Estimates of time needed for the translation
References to the applied glossary (when using DeepL Pro)
Content of the applied glossary (when using the free translator)
Number of characters calculated
Errors that occurred during the translation process
This information is processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR based  on our legitimate interest in improving the functionality of our products, as this makes it easier  to identify any sources of error related to the translation process. The data is stored in a database that can only be accessed by selected employees and is automatically deleted after 14 days.
8. Automatic Collection of Data via Website Access
Regardless of whether you use our paid or free service, your device automatically transmits certain data for technical reasons when you access our website
www.deepl.com
. The following data that you may send us will be stored:
Date and time of access
Browser type and version
Operating system
URL of the website previously visited
Volume of data transmitted
Requested domain
Notification of successful data retrieval
Search term when using a web browser
Abbreviated/anonymized IP
Full IP address
Diagnostic information in the event of errors
Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website. The data is stored for purely technical reasons. Website access data is used for error analysis, ensuring  system security, logging access to DeepL Pro and for improving our translation or improvement services. Based on your IP address, we also use geolocation to determine the region from which you are visiting our website. We use this information to check whether we can offer you the DeepL Pro service in your region, which corresponds to our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. The storage of the full IP address for the users of the DeepL free version for a maximum period of 14 days is also justified by our legitimate interest in achieving the listed purposes, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. The storage of IP addresses of users of the paid DeepL Pro subscription for the duration of the contract is justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.
Our website also uses services of Cloudflare, Inc, 101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA ("Cloudflare"), which operates a so-called Content Delivery Network (CDN). To protect our website, the data transfer between your browser and our servers is routed through Cloudflare's infrastructure in order to analyze whether it is an abusive attack. As part of this analysis, your data is transmitted to Cloudflare in encrypted form, if necessary also to Cloudflare servers in the USA. However, since your requests and other customer data are encrypted between your end device and the DeepL servers, Cloudflare does not have any access to this data, but only to meta-data (such as your IP address). Only static resources (such as graphics) are loaded directly from Cloudflare-servers. In addition, Cloudflare determines a so-called bot score immediately before the login to DeepL, which is based on the analysis of the metadata of the client (browser) used. The use of Cloudflare is in our legitimate interest to secure the use of our website and to prevent and defend harmful attacks from outside, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Cloudflare and Cloudflare may therefore only process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes. You can find more information about Cloudflare's handling of personal data

Please note that if you completely disable the use of cookies, web storage objects and other technologies, the functionality and scope of the website may be impaired.
These cookies may process personal data including data about your device, such as your IP address as set out in section 8 above. Where we use non-necessary cookies as set out below and process your personal data, we will only do so where you have provided us with your consent.
We specifically use cookies or web storage objects in the following categories:
Necessary: These cookies or web storage objects are necessary for our website to work properly, to enable smooth navigation and access our most important functions. This includes essential security and accessibility features and preferences such as interface and translator language as well as the handling of the checkout process for DeepL Pro. The collecting of data via the necessary cookies or web storage objects is justified according to § 25 para. 2 no. 2 TDDDG (“Telekommunikation-Digitale-Dienste-Datenschutz-Gesetz”: German Telecommunications and Digital Services Data Protection Act). The further processing of this data is either necessary in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR for performing the contract or justified due to our legitimate interest in presenting our products and our company in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
Performance: These cookies or web storage objects measure how our site is used. We use this information to improve our website and services. With these cookies we measure, for example, how often users return and which functions they use. We and our external service providers use these cookies or web storage objects with your explicit consent in accordance with § 25 para. 1 TDDDG. The further processing of this data is also based on your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR.
Functional: These cookies or web storage objects enable us to provide you with enhanced functionality and personalization on our website.

You can do this by deactivating (or activating) the slide button in the top right-hand corner of the respective category in the table below.
9.2 Analysis of User Behavior
In order to better understand how our products are used and to better tailor our products to the needs and desires of our customers, we analyze pseudonymized data about our customers' use of DeepL Pro products. The analysis allows us to understand general usage habits and derive different target and user groups. We can then address the identified user groups in a more specific way and, for example, point them to previously unused or unknown features of our products. In this way, we enable our customers to get to know and use all the features of their DeepL subscription and can thus improve the user experience of the DeepL products. This corresponds to our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) GDPR. The data is processed exclusively on DeepL’s servers in the EEA, the data is not transferred to the USA. No transfer of the data to third parties takes place. 

In case that users visit the website
https://developers.deepl.com
which is hosted by GitBook we use the services of Conva Ventures Inc. (“Conva Ventures” the corporation behind Fathom Analytics) to get basic insights about how our API documentation is being used. For the analysis, no cookie is set, and the analysis will only rely on the IP address and user agent of the user which will be hashed first. These pseudo-anonymized hashes will be anonymized after 24 hours. The data will be processed on servers in the USA. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Conva Ventures and Conva Ventures only processes the data in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes.

10. Speech-to-text function for web
For the web version of our DeepL Translator, we also offer a speech-to-text function, where the text to be translated can be dictated yourself. The recorded text is transcribed solely within DeepL's internal infrastructure.
When using DeepL Pro, the recordings and the transcriptions will not be permanently stored and will only be kept temporarily to the extent necessary for the production and transmission of the translation. After complete performance of the contractually agreed services the recordings, their transcriptions and the translations will be deleted. This does not apply when using the speech-to-text function as part of the free version of DeepL translator or the DeepL account, where the recordings, their transcriptions and the translations are stored and processed for a limited period of time to train and improve our neural networks and translation algorithms (please see also section 3 of this privacy policy). The user will be informed of this before using the speech-to-text function for the first time and asked to give their consent. The consent does not cover the recording of the voices of third parties, which means, you are not permitted to record the voices of third parties. You can withdraw the consent you have given at any time with effect for the future. You do this by deleting the corresponding cookie set by the consent. For further information and explanation of the withdrawal process, please click
here
.
11. DeepL Apps
In addition to the translation and improvement services on our website, we also offer apps for Windows and macOS operating systems (“desktop apps”), as well as apps for iOS and Android (“mobile apps”), through which you can also translate or improve texts.
You can use the desktop apps and the mobile apps in both the free version and the paid DeepL Pro version. If you use the free version of DeepL in the apps, Section
3
of this Privacy Policy applies; if you use the paid DeepL Pro version, Sections
4
to
6
apply. As the desktop apps use the same interfaces for creating translations or improvements as the web-based service, also sections
7
and
8
of this privacy policy apply to the use of these apps.
When translating or improving texts with our apps, for technical reasons - regardless of whether you use our paid or free service - your device will automatically transmit certain data. The following data which you can transmit to us, is stored:
Date and time of access
Version of the app
Operating system
Volume of data transmitted
Notification of successful data retrieval
Abbreviated/anonymized IP address
Full IP address
Diagnostic information in the event of errors
Type of mobile device (only for iOS and Android app)
Language in use
Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
Access status/HTTP status code
The processing of this data is based on our legitimate interest in ensuring and improving the stability and functionality of our services, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. This data is stored solely for technical reasons. Data relating to access is used for error analysis, ensuring system security, logging access to DeepL Pro and to improve our translation or improvement services. The full IP address of users using the free version of DeepL is stored for a maximum period of 14 days, which is also justified by our legitimate interest in achieving the listed purposes, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. The full IP address of DeepL Pro users is stored for the duration of the contract on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.
If you use our mobile apps, it is also possible to have the entered text and the translation or improvement read aloud or to dictate the text to be translated or improved yourself. The speech service installed on your device is used for this purpose. Please note that this may result in the transfer of the entered or spoken content to the provider of the speech service used by your device, possibly also to the USA. DeepL has no influence on this processing of your voice and audio data, therefore the privacy policy and terms of use of the speech service used by your device e.g. provided by Apple, Google or Samsung, but also those of other speech services that cannot be listed exhaustively, apply.
We use necessary cookies and web storage objects in our desktop apps as described in section
9
.
No cookies are used in our mobile apps. However, a unique user ID (no cross-device ID) is used, which allows us to track, for example, the source and target language settings, how many characters are translated or improved, whether the copy button is used, and if so, how it is used. The processing of this data is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR) to better understand the needs of our users and to be able to adapt the app according to customer requirements.
12. DeepL API Free
In addition to the paid DeepL API Pro plan, we also offer a limited free version of our API (DeepL API Free). For further information, please see our
DeepL Pro Terms and Conditions
and section
3
on using the free version of DeepL.
In order to use DeepL API Free, it is necessary to create a DeepL account (please see section
6.1
). If you select the API Free option during the checkout process, further data, as specified in section
6.2
, will be collected. Although no costs are incurred when using DeepL API Free - subject to a (possible) upgrade - your payment data is collected in order to prevent improper use of API Free. Solely for this purpose, payment information is also passed on, in accordance with section
6.3
, to the payment service provider we have commissioned, Stripe Payments Europe Ltd.
We process your data in order to perform the free-of-charge usage contract concluded between you and us on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR and on the basis of our legitimate interest in preventing misuse of the API Free, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence lit. f) GDPR.
13. Connecting with our Customer Team, including via our ChatBot
You have various possibilities to connect with us, including via contact forms on our website, having calls with our customer team as well as by using our chatbot. You can also contact us directly by email.
We will process your personal data that you provide to us as part of these communications. This may include your name, email address and any other personal data you disclose to us.
13.1 Recording of dialer and Zoom calls
Our customer team is conducting dialer and Zoom calls with prospects and customers to provide them with general information about DeepL's services and to advise them according to their needs. In order to continue to provide excellent customer service and to continuously improve it, we may record and transcribe the dialer and zoom calls with prospects and customers
in certain countries
with their consent, using the Salesloft platform provided by Salesloft, Inc., 1180 West Peachtree St NW Suite 2400, Atlanta, GA 30309. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Salesloft and Salesloft is therefore only allowed to process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes.
Recordings of the calls, including transcriptions of these, are used for internal training and coaching as well as for documentation purposes. At the beginning of each dialer call, an automated message will inform the called party that the call is being recorded. If you do not wish to participate in a recorded call, you can end the call at any time. For Zoom calls, the Zoom invitation will inform you that the call is being recorded and that you can opt out when you join the call.
All recorded calls, including transcriptions, will be securely stored for a period of two years from the date of the call. After this period, the recordings will be automatically deleted from our systems. You also have the rights mentioned in section 20.
13.2 Sales and Support Requests
If you would like to send us a sales enquiry in order to receive further information about our products and subscription plans or to start contract negotiations, you are welcome to use our sales contact forms. In addition to your email address, you are required to provide your name and telephone number; all other information is optional. For the provision of our contact forms, we use the HubSpot service (see section 14).
We also use the Customer Relationship Management System (CRM) of Salesforce.com Germany GmbH, Erika-Mann-Str. 31, 80636 München, Deutschland (“Salesforce CRM”) to manage our customer database, which includes our existing and potential customers, and to organize sales and communication processes. Furthermore, Salesforce CRM enables us to analyse our customer-related processes. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Salesforce and Salesforce is therefore only allowed to process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes. The customer data is stored on servers in the EU.
If you contact our support team with questions about your subscription, for example via our contact form, it is necessary to provide a valid email address so that we know who the inquiry comes from and can respond to it. We use the ticket system provided by Zendesk Inc. ("Zendesk"), 1019 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA We have entered into a data processing agreement with Zendesk and Zendesk may therefore only process the data in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes. Further information on the handling of personal data at Zendesk can be found
here
.
For both support and sales enquiries including any subsequent correspondence, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of your personal data, as the processing is necessary for the initiation of the contract or the conclusion and performance of our contract. Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR also provides justification for the processing of personal data that may be contained in documents sent to our Support team. We will store your data for the duration of our business relationship and subsequently for the duration of the legal retention periods where this is required. The processing of your personal data as part of our customer database and the analyses of our customer-related processes is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is in our legitimate interest.
If you have contacted our Support team via the contact form, it is possible that we will subsequently inquire by email about your satisfaction with our customer service. In this case, we will process your data on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR in order to determine customer satisfaction and to continuously improve our service.
13.3 Privacy Requests
You also have the option of contacting privacy(at)deepl.com with questions or concerns about data protection at DeepL. We process your data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR on the basis of your voluntarily given consent.

13.1

As part of this, your data may also be transferred to the USA. We have concluded a data processing agreement with HubSpot and therefore HubSpot may only process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes.

15. User research and surveys
15.1 User surveys
Users are given the opportunity to participate in surveys via the web and app interface of our services. Participation in the surveys is voluntary and can be achieved, for example, via a pop-up found on the interface. The user may be redirected to a third party website (e.g. Qualtrics) to complete the survey.In order for us to properly analyse the survey results, we match your survey results with your product interaction that we collect when you use our DeepL products. This helps us to get better insights on how our users respond to our services, which help us to improve our DeepL product offering and services based on the collected survey information. Your personal data will not be collected or processed throughout the entire process. We won’t ask you to enter any personal data when taking part in the survey. Furthermore, to collect your product interaction data we don’t collect or process your IP-address. In order to obtain this data from you, we will assign you a user ID upon confirmation that you wish to participate in the survey. This user ID – in the form of a cookie – does not give away any personal data about the person behind the interaction data and is therefore anonymised.
Your survey results and product interaction data (if any) will be stored and processed collectively by DeepL for up to 2 years.
If personal data is nevertheless collected or processed in the aforementioned process - which we do not plan or assume from our side - we justify this via Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this represents the least intrusion into the rights of the user in contrast to an opt-in and corresponds to the principle of data minimisation. You may withdraw your consent for the cookie at any time with effect for the future by deleting your browser cache.
15.2 Customer Surveys
We want to encourage customers to share their experiences with using our products. DeepL may therefore reach out to you occasionally, via email or other communication channels, to ask about your experience and/or satisfaction with our products. Participation in these surveys is voluntary, and most surveys can be answered anonymously. However, in some instances you may be asked to provide your name and/or email address, either optionally or as a requirement for completing the survey. If you provide us with your email, we may contact you afterwards (e.g., to invite you to participate in research studies or to share your experience in a call with our team).
The processing of your data corresponds to our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR to improve our products and to further develop them according to our customer’s wishes. If you provide your name and/or email address in the survey, we justify the processing of your data via your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR. You can revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future.
15.3 Typeform
To conduct the customer satisfaction surveys, we use a service of Typeform SL, Carrer Bac de Roda, 163, local, 08018 Barcelona, Spain ("Typeform"), on whose platform the surveys are stored. Typeform uses different subcontractors, which are also partly located in third countries outside the EU. Therefore, in certain cases, there may be a transfer of your data to the USA. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Typeform and Typeform only processes the data in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes. You can find more information about Typeform's handling of personal data

Access to the surveys is placed on the website by DeepL so that each user can freely decide whether to participate in the survey. Qualtrics uses different subcontractors, which are also partly located in third countries outside the EU. Therefore, in certain cases, there may be a transfer of your data to the USA. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Qualtrics and therefore Qualtrics may only process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes.

You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by sending an email to privacy(at)deepl.com. Please state the exact day and, if possible, the time of the interview.

16. DeepL’s Social Media Pages
DeepL operates several social media profiles (also called “pages”) on various social networks e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Xing. There we regularly publish posts about our products, new product features as well as new job offers. If you interact with our pages or contact us via them and are a member of the respective social network, we may receive and process data that identify you. As operator of the pages, we also have the option of viewing anonymous statistics on the interaction of visitors with our pages (insight function). For this purpose, the operators of the social networks record your interactions with our pages using cookies and similar technologies. You can find more information on this kind of data processing by Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn
here
,
here
and
here
.
The legal basis for the operation of our social media profiles and the insights function is our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR in using the pages as an information channel for our company. With regard to the insights function, we have a legitimate interest in understanding the visits and interactions with our page in order to be able to respond to them and to further improve our presence. Insofar as your consent given to the social network justifies the data processing within the framework of the respective social platform, processing is carried out on the basis of this consent.
In addition, we use the LinkedIn image pixel to record and evaluate conversions from our LinkedIn advertising campaigns. Conversions mean whether a user is successfully led to our website via our LinkedIn advertising campaign. Furthermore, user interactions - i.e., individual steps taken by the user on our website - are to be recorded and tracked via conversions. The LinkedIn image pixel is embedded on certain pages of our website and provides feedback to LinkedIn if a conversion has taken place. In doing so, LinkedIn processes the user’s IP address as well as the presence of a cookie set by LinkedIn, which provides conclusions about the conversion. The processing of your personal data is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR). The consent is given via the cookie settings. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future by revoking the consent for the “Marketing” cookie category or deleting your browser cache.
Please note that we together with the operator of the respective social network are jointly responsible for the data processing operations triggered when you visit our page. However, the operators of the social networks may also process your data for their own purposes, which are not depicted in this privacy policy. It is also possible that data collected about you will be transferred to third countries, in particular the USA. We have no influence on this data processing and refer to the privacy policies of the respective social networks e.g., for Facebook
here
, for Instagram
here
, for Twitter
here
, for LinkedIn
here
and for Xing
here
.
In principle, you can assert your rights (see section
20
below) both against us and against the  operator of the respective social platform. However, we would like to point out that despite the joint controllership, you can most effectively assert your rights with the operators of the social networks. If you need help, you can contact us.
17. Webinars
We offer webinars for our users and existing or prospective customers. The webinars are interactive events on the products we offer, conducted by our staff. External speakers may also be invited to the webinars. We point this out accordingly before registration.
We use a service provided by Zoom Video Communications, Inc. ("Zoom"), 55 Almaden Blvd. Suite 600, San Jose, CA 95113, USA, on whose platform the webinars are held. Registration for our webinars takes place via a corresponding landing page of Zoom. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Zoom and Zoom may only process personal data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes. We would like to point out that if you access Zoom's website, Zoom is responsible for the personal data processed through your use of the website. If you have entered into a contractual relationship with Zoom, we have no influence on the personal data collected and processed in this context as part of our webinars. Further information on the handling of personal data at Zoom - in particular also in relation to webinars - can be found
here
.
In the event of registration for a webinar on a landing page provided by Zoom, we collect and process all personal data that you provide when registering for one of our webinars (first and last name, email address, company (optional), position (optional)). We process your data to fulfil the free participation contract concluded between you and us on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. We store your data on this basis for the duration of the existence of our contractual relationship, i.e. until the conclusion of the webinar, and subsequently for the duration of the statutory retention periods where this is required. If you have a DeepL account and it is possible for us to assign the webinar registration to this account, the processing of your personal data in the context of our customer database and the analyses of our customer-related processes until the end of the webinar is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is in our legitimate interest to record the demand for webinars and in this context to improve the services for our customers. After completion of the webinar, we note in our customer database under your account that you participated in the webinar. The name and e-mail address given during registration will not be noted and - if they do not match the details in the DeepL account created - will be deleted by us after the webinar has ended. Should personal data be processed at all in this note in the customer database beyond the webinar, we base this on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is in our legitimate interest to specifically identify whether customers understand our products in order to provide them with support more quickly in individual cases, or in order to provide certain customers with extended webinars and training.
When participating in a webinar and using Zoom, the following additional personal data is processed:
User information (This is data associated with the Zoom account and its authentication, e.g. first name, last name, display name, email address, password (unless Single Sign On (SSO) is used), profile picture, Zoom unique user ID);
Communication data (This is data that you independently enter, upload or share as part of the webinar and associated Zoom usage);
Meeting metadata and telemetry data (This technical data is, among other things, data relating to the use of the service, including when and how sessions were conducted (IP address, event logs, session information, etc.), as well as device and hardware information that Zoom needs to access in order for features such as camera, microphone, etc. to be operational in the context of participation).
Please note that it is also possible to participate in the webinar without having a Zoom account. In this case, the collection and processing of data is limited to the minimum necessary to be able to maintain the service for you. We have chosen settings so that the collection and processing of the communication content generally takes place on servers in the European Union. As Zoom is based in the USA, we cannot exclude the possibility that data processing (in particular meeting metadata) may also take place in the USA when using the service. A collection and processing of your data through the use of Zoom takes place on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR (participation contract). We store the data collected and processed by Zoom on our behalf for the duration of the Zoom webinar and subsequently for the duration of the statutory retention periods, if this is required. We have no influence on the duration of the data processed by Zoom under its own responsibility. Please contact Zoom directly for information in this regard.
Automated decision-making pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR does not take place.
Please note that we may record Zoom webinars and publish them afterwards on our website or social media channels. Participants will not be visible or identifiable in these recordings. As participants can only ask written questions, they will not appear visually in the recording. The answer to the participant's question will be part of the webinar recording. If, contrary to expectations, personal data of the participants is visible during the recording, it will be made unrecognisable before publication.  The recording and storage of the webinar is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as these processing operations are in our legitimate interest to improve the quality of our webinars. When the webinars are published, no further processing of personal data will take place, as we will make them unrecognisable beforehand - if they can be viewed at all.

We regularly evaluate our data processing procedures and modify them as necessary. In addition, we work with strict physical access controls to e.g. our IT infrastructure and data storage systems as well as to documents that contain personal data.
As outlined above in section 9.2, we analyze pseudonymized data about our customers' use of DeepL Pro products to understand general usage habits and derive different target and user groups. Pseudonymized data is used only until the purpose of data analysis is fulfilled and is destroyed thereafter.

Fees

Payment Term
”). Client agrees to remit payment by wire transfer or ACH, unless the invoice is $3,000 or less, in which event Client may remit payment by credit card. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable. Each Client Affiliate will be invoiced separately. Should the Parties agree to allow Client to pay in a currency other than USD, GBP or EUR, Client shall be charged an additional 0.15% on the invoiced amount.
Late Payment; Disputes
. Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month, or the maximum percentage permitted by law (whichever is lower), in addition to all reasonable costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.

Taxes
. All fees are exclusive of taxes and duties. If the Services are subject to collection or payment of any federal, state, or local tax under the Agreement, or any other similar taxes or duties levied by any governmental authority, excluding taxes levied on Riskified’s net income, then such taxes and/or duties shall be invoiced to and paid solely by Client upon receipt of invoice.

Term

Early Termination
”). In the event of Early Termination, Client shall pay Riskified an amount equal to the gross average monthly Fees invoiced by Riskified and multiplied by the number of months remaining in the then-current Term (“
Early Termination Fee
”), which will be reduced by any and all credits owed to Client in the final invoice. Client acknowledges and agrees that the Early Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages and is not a penalty and that the amount of actual loss due to the foregoing is difficult to precisely estimate and the amount of liquidated damages bears a reasonable proportion to the probable loss that Riskified will suffer in relation to the foregoing.
Termination for Breach
. If a Party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice from the other Party outlining the nature of such breach, then the other Party may terminate the affected Order Form(s).

Vendor Code of Conduct
Riskified Ltd. (“Riskified” ) strives to achieve the highest standard of business and professional integrity, and seeks to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. We expect our vendors, suppliers, distributors, partners, business associates, and third party representatives (“
Vendors
” ) to uphold these standards of conduct and professional integrity and communicate them to their organization.
This Vendor Code of Conduct (“Code”) sets forth Riskified’s expectation that its Vendors uphold the highest standards of ethics and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
These expectations should complement each Vendor’s own company policies, applicable legal requirements, and the terms of any agreements that a Vendor may have with Riskified. Failure to comply with this Code could result in termination of the business relationship. Riskified encourages Vendors to raise questions or concerns about this Code to their Riskified point of contact.
Riskified’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets forth our compliance standards in more detail, is available at
https://ir.riskified.com/corporate-governance/documents-charters
Riskified expects its Vendors to be honest, ethical and transparent when dealing with Riskified, its employees, customers and other third parties.
Vendors are expected to monitor Vendors own compliance with this Code and report any integrity concern or violations of this Code or otherwise involving or affecting Riskified. When requested, Vendors are expected to assist Riskified in investigating concerns.
Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations
Riskified expects its Vendors to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to the Vendor’s business, particularly those related to Vendor’s performance of duties for Riskified.
Anti-corruption compliance & business expenses
Riskified prohibits bribes, kickbacks, or other improper or illegal payments of anything of value from being directly or indirectly offered, paid, promised or authorized in any way related to Riskified, whether it involves public officials (including officers or employees of governments or state-owned entities) or private parties.
Riskified also prohibits bribery to influence a public official, to obtain or retain business from any party, or to secure an unfair business advantage.
Riskified also prohibits Vendors from making facilitation payments, or small, unofficial payments to public officials to expedite routine, non-discretionary government processes or decisions (even if permissible under local law).
All business expenses provided by Vendors related to Riskified’s business – including gifts (whether money or any other thing of value), hospitality, entertainment, events, travel, or accommodation – must comply with any agreements with Riskified; have a legitimate business purpose; be reasonable and modest in value and frequency; comply with local law; and be accurately recorded.
