Legal obligations

The HERE Technologies Privacy Charter
Data privacy is of fundamental importance to HERE and our customers.
That’s why it’s a cornerstone of our evolution and growth as a location platform. We’ve built the HERE Open Location Platform from the ground up to enable you and your business to be in control of your data at all times. We combine these controls with strong data security processes.
We practice data minimization and don’t collect data we don’t need. And we promote pseudonymity for data subjects wherever a service does not require personal information to function. We employ privacy by design in services we develop. We strive to go beyond mere regulatory compliance and make privacy an integral part of our corporate culture. We believe that our approach to privacy is vital to earning and retaining the trust of our customers – and the bedrock of our future success as a data-driven location platform
Our seven privacy principles
Accountable, fair and lawful collection and processing
Privacy by Design and Default
Transparency, choice and individual participation
Collection and purpose limitation
Responsible data management
No disclosure of personal data to law enforcement or other governmental agencies unless required by law
Security safeguards against unauthorized access, use, modification or loss
We put you in control of your data
With the HERE Open Location Platform, you have exclusive control over your data and how it’s used
The OLP supports realm separation, and the HERE OLP Marketplace provides full control on data visibility and sharing. That means you determine to whom you expose your data and how it is consumed by others, including HERE itself
We build controls into HERE-developed services
E.g. When tracking goods moving through your supply chain with HERE Tracking, only you are able to see and identify the items you’re tracking – unless you provide access to others. You can delete your data whenever you want. And if you don’t wish to maintain a historical record of tracked goods, you can enable automatic data deletion at, say, the end of each day.
We apply data minimization & pseudonymization
Everything within reason. We've taken a reductive approach to data collection, seeking to collect and maintain the minimum amount of data needed for a specified purpose
Wide use of anonymous or pseudonymous data, and a focus on high quality data from trusted sources
Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) data integration is available in OLP, enabling customers to bring in only the data they need
We apply a data minimization approach in HERE-developed services
E.g. We've designed the HERE Safety Services Suite to work using only crowdsourced vehicle sensor data pre-processed and anonymized before it reaches us. This prevents a vehicle or its owner from being identified
E.g. For our HERE Positioning service, we only collect information we need for positioning which doesn’t identify the end-user
A note on machine learning:
A data minimization approach does not preclude the use of artificial intelligence or machine learning. On the contrary, ensuring data quality and integrity enhances, rather than impedes, our efforts to use such technologies
Most services we provide are oriented to provide services in location context without identifying the end-user. Where personal data may be involved, we strive to apply pseudonymization techniques to reduce the direct identifiability of data related to individuals
We apply automated random re-assignment and rotation of ID numbers associated with vehicles/devices supplying traffic probe data
Longer traces can be broken into shorter segments useful for identifying traffic conditions but making it much harder to use patterns to possibly identify individuals
In street-side imagery collection for map making purposes, we apply blurring filters to vehicle registration numbers and faces in street-level imagery
For our HERE On-Street Parking service, vehicles notify us when they park ; however, we apply geofences to exclude rural areas to reduce the possibility that a piece of data could be connected to an individual
We keep your data safe
There can be no data privacy without data security. We use strong and effective measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, use, modification or loss.
We provide strong encryption methods to protect customer and consumer information, while preserving its utility in personalized services. This means OLP can handle personal data related use cases, such as UBI
Strong encryption by default on all datasets at rest and in motion in OLP
HERE maintains relevant certifications such as ISO 27001
Our highly-secure over-the-air (OTA) technology protects updates for edge devices against attackers. It uses the Uptane security framework, the first compromise-resilient software update security system for the automotive industry designed jointly by security researchers from academia and auto OEMs/suppliers
We're developing privacy-enhancing technologies for the future
Location services customized to individuals’ needs hold enormous promise, but only when combined with user-friendly consent management. In this area, HERE has vital new technology under development.
For people to enjoy uninterrupted access to new services in the autonomous world, a new approach to privacy is needed. We believe in equipping people and businesses with transparent consent and preference management tools to help them stay in better control of their location data
We’re developing centralized consent/preference management technology
We’re also investing in privacy-enhancing technologies in the areas of anonymization, differential privacy and federated machine learning
We use technology such as cookies on HERE websites to provide a better user experience, deliver personalized content and promote relevant offers to you, on both HERE and selected third party websites. To make this happen we’re asking you to consent to the use of this technology now, including placement of cookies by third parties as outlined in our cookie policy. The consent settings can be modified at any time in the website. See our
"Privacy/Cookie Policy"

Your privacy in HERE WeGo, HERE application and HERE Maps
What’s new?
GDPR: The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), a new European Union (EU) data protection law, takes effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR gives individuals in the EU more control over how their data is used and places certain obligations on businesses that process personal information of those individuals. We’ve updated our Privacy Policy to take into account the new requirements of the GDPR.
Transparency: We’ve provided additional transparency in relation to our processing of your personal data in context of the Service. However, this update does not change the manner in which we process your personal data.
Your rights: You have the ability to access, request for download and deletion of your personal information.
HERE’s Privacy Policy
explains how we process your personal data when you use our products and services. In addition, the following information applies to your use of HERE WeGo, HERE application or HERE Maps (the “Service”).The purpose of this document is to give background information on data processing for different features available in the Service. The features of the Service enable you to find places and addresses on a map, interact with them and access relevant content, as well as locate yourself on a map. With navigation you are able to find the optimal route to your destination, even inside buildings. You can relive and share your location experiences with your friends on different Social Networking Services (“SNS”).
We encourage you to familiarise yourself with the privacy policies of third party services, when you interact with them. HERE is not in control or responsible for the contents and features of those services.
Please understand that the features of the Service may depend on how you access the Service. Different device models and software versions of the Service may offer different features.
What information do we collect?
We collect the following categories of information:
Registration and contact details
Some features may require the use of HERE account, for example when you want to synchronise your collections. You may continue to use the other features of the Service without signing in.
When you are logged in with your HERE account, we will try to automatically synchronise your recent searches and your collections in association with your HERE account.
Location data and place information
Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (“Location Data”) and information about places (“Place Information”). Location Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been. Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as Assisted GPS. In many device models the user interface of the Service identifies the use of positioning with an icon. Place Information is general information pertaining to particular geographical location (e.g. city or a location of a restaurant) that you may have provided to us, for example your collections.
Unless otherwise stated, we use random identifiers in connection with your Location Data that do not identify you personally.
When you start to use the Service, the applicable Service activates your selected positioning methods to retrieve your current location.
The Service may send your Location Data to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as ask information about nearby services or offerings, use search features, as well as when the Service asks for new maps for new areas you have navigated into. As further defined below, Location Data may be collected when you use the traffic feature for service improvement purposes without identifying you personally. Place Information may be sent to HERE for example when you synchronise your collections.
Information about Service usage
You may participate to improving our services. See
Your privacy in the HERE Improvement Program
for more details.
The Service may include HERE-provided positioning services, including Wi-Fi or other network-based positioning methods. The use of these technologies and positioning services may involve sharing any or all of the following with HERE: Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp; number of satellites used in positioning; parameters of nearby mobile network towers; parameters of nearby Wi-Fi routers and/or Bluetooth® beacons; Mobile Country Code and Mobile Network Code of your mobile subscription. This information is sent to us when you use the Service online, after which it is deleted from your device. We do not use this data to identify you personally or combine this information with your HERE account.
When you decide to use the traffic features of the Service, Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp are sent from your device to HERE to detect traffic jams, traffic patterns, changed road conditions and other such conditions so that we can provide you with better service. This information is analysed to distinguish independent routes and traffic patterns and contains an identifier, which is persistent for the duration of the route.
You may choose the extent to which you contribute to the improvement of our services. In the context of traffic features of the Service, you can provide us with the Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp, along with the changing identifier, either when you use the Service, when the Service is not actively used or even when the applicable Service is closed. If the app is closed, we’ll attempt to detect when you’re driving to enable the background collection. We may use methods available from the mobile operating system or other contextual information to detect driving scenarios. You can always change your preferences in the app settings either in Settings or About.
This information is sent to us when you use the Service online, after which it is deleted from your device. We do not use this data to identify you personally or combine or otherwise associate this information with your HERE account.
Technical information and your transactions
When you use the Service online, certain technical information such as the type of your mobile device, unique device or network service provider identifiers, internet protocol address, time zone, technical details of your client as well as your transactions with HERE may be automatically collected by HERE.
Our uses of your data
Non-personal use of Location Data or Place Information
We do not associate your Location Data or Place Information with your other personally identifiable information, such as HERE account, unless you have asked us to do so. For example, if you save a place to your collection, we do not combine this information with your Location Data unless you have asked us to do so. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent associating your Location Data with other personally identifiable information without your permission.
Provision and development of the Service
The information collected by the Service is used to provide you with the Service and to develop our products and services.
Communicate with you and make recommendations
We may also use this information to communicate with you and provide you with more improved search and recommendations to better assist you to find a place you may like.
Location based advertising
The Service may include provision of location based advertising or other similar content. You may be positioned separately for this purpose. For example if you ask for weather information you may be served with advertising content tailored to that location.
The Service may also include behaviourally profiled advertisements. For the purposes of provisioning relevant advertisements to you, we may share your device specific advertising ID to advertising networks. We use a third party company called MoPub to deliver ads to you. The MoPub SDK collects information about your device while you use the Service. This information may include, but is not limited to, your device identifier, model and related configuration (such as screen size), mobile operator as well as IP address. In addition, we provide you with means to increase the relevance of the advertising you see in the app by sharing your location with the advertising network. If you wish not to share your location with the advertising network, you can choose do so in the app settings under ‘Location-based ads’. If you wish to change your settings related to behaviourally profiled advertising, you can always do so from your device settings. Note that in any case you may still receive ads, but just not profiled.
What is our legal basis for processing your Personal Data?
We process your personal data in context of the Service for the following legal bases:
Performance of a contract with you
We process your personal data to perform our obligations under the Service Terms.
Your consent
This Service enables you to activate additional optional features and/or functionalities and help us improve the Service, including Traffic, HERE Improvement Program and related search improvement.
Once you activate an optional feature or functionality, we process your personal data based on your consent. You may revoke your consent, at any time, by changing your settings in Settings or About. Doing so will bar us from processing of your personal data based on your consent from that day onward, but will not impact the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data based on your consent before it was withdrawn. Please note that some of the features in the Service may only be available to you based on consent.
How long do we retain Personal Data?
We endeavor to only collect personal data that are necessary for the purposes for which they are collected, and to retain such data for no longer than is necessary for such purposes. The length of time personal data is retained, and criteria for determining that time, are dependent on the nature of the personal data and the purpose for which it was provided. For example, your personal data related to managing your account (such as name, email address, and account content and preferences) are maintained for as long as they are retained by you within your account. Other data, such as records of your activity within the Service (as applicable), are typically maintained only for a short period before being anonymized. You may contact the HERE Privacy Office at
privacy@HERE.com
to obtain additional information about retention of your personal data.
Your choices
The Service offers a variety of choices to allow you to control how your Location Data and other information are collected.
You may use the Service in offline or online mode. No Location Data or other information is sent to HERE if you only use the Service in offline mode. In offline mode, your device will also not interact with the advertising networks. Note, that your device may nevertheless continue to store and have already stored information which may be sent to HERE as defined earlier in this document and if you participate to HERE Improvement Program or have enabled traffic feature. Note also that you may still receive ads, in case such ads have been cached in the device prior to switching the device into offline mode.
You can choose the level at which you participate in the development of HERE’s products and services. You may separately turn the
HERE Improvement Program
and traffic on and off.
You can only enable the traffic features if you also contribute to the improvement of our services. Once enabled, you can choose the extent to which you contribute to the improvement of our services: only when the app is running or when the app is running or closed. Please note that you may be able to independently turn the traffic layer on and off. This only impacts the visualization of the traffic content.
You can switch positioning services on and off using your device settings. Device positioning settings also control HERE positioning services. If you configure your device such that you are not using any assisted positioning methods, HERE positioning services will also not be used.
You can choose to share your location with advertising networks to provide you with more location-relevant advertisements. You can always turn this on and off in the app settings.
You may also clear your recent searches and destinations from the local storage of the Service. Clearing local storage will also clear already synchronised recent searches in the next synchronization instance.
Information sharing
Your Location Data will not be shared with other service providers or advertisers without your permission.
The Service may allow you to share your Location Data or Place Information with a social network or directly with your friends. The Service also includes content from and links to third party sites and services. When you interact with these sites and services, you may provide your current location to them. We recommend you to check your settings and the privacy policies of such social networks or other third parties to understand how they process your information.
We may share your device specific advertising ID to advertising networks for provisioning of relevant advertisements. We use a third party company called MoPub to deliver ads to you. The MoPub SDK collects information about your device while you use the Service. This information may include, but is not limited to, your device identifier, model and related configuration (such as screen size), mobile operator as well as IP address. In addition, we provide you with means to increase the relevance of the advertising you see in the app by sharing your location with the advertising network. If you wish not to share your location with the advertising network, you can choose do so in the app settings under ‘Location-based ads’. If you wish to change your settings related to behaviourally profiled advertising, you can always do so from your device settings. Note that you may still receive ads, but just not profiled.
When you initiate Glympse sharing, Glympse sharing will continue on the background for the specified time, unless you stop it manually. You will see a small ‘G’ icon on the notification bar of your device to indicate the real-time sharing. Use appropriate consideration when sharing your location with others. Glympse is the provider of this feature.
As explained in more detail in our privacy policy, we may share your personal data:
with your consent;
with HERE companies and authorised third parties, who process personal data on our behalf;
where there is a legal requirement to do so.
What are your rights?
As explained in more detail in our privacy policy, you have the right to:
know what personal data we hold about you, and to access it.

Your privacy in Automotive navigation from HERE
The purpose of this document is to provide information on the processing of your personal data in connection with your use of the Automotive navigation system and its features (the “Service”).
The features of the Service enable you for example to navigate from one place to another, find places and addresses on a map, interact with them and access relevant content, as well as synchronize information related to your drives to access from other screens and devices. You can share places, routes and arrival times with your friends. The Service also helps you to optimize your daily commute by learning your habits.
This document applies to the following elements that the Service can include depending on the vehicle’s make, model and the navigation system in use:
- the in-vehicle navigation system,
- the online account which enables you to plan your route in advance and sync it with your vehicle, and
- the navigation or route planning mobile device application which continues to guide you outside of your vehicle.
The Service includes experiences designed for use by a driver as well as other users of the vehicle, such as co-drivers or passengers, passengers. It is your responsibility to ensure that this information along with applicable terms is passed on to such other users.
1. Categories of data we process
We collect the following categories of information:
1.1 Registration and contact details
Some features may require the use of HERE account, for example when you want to synchronize your collections. When you register, we collect your registration credentials and settings such as country/region and language preference. You may continue to use the other features of the Service without signing in. When you are logged in with your HERE account, we will try to automatically synchronize your recent searches and your collections in association with your HERE account.
1.2 Location Data and Place Information
Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (“Location Data”) and information about places (“Place Information”). Location Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been. Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as GPS. In many device models the user interface of the Service identifies the use of positioning with an icon. Place Information is general information pertaining to particular geographical location (e.g. city or a location of a restaurant) that you may have provided to us, for example your collections or saved destinations.
Unless otherwise stated, we use random identifiers in connection with your Location Data that do not identify you personally.
When you start to use the Service, the applicable Service activates your selected positioning methods to retrieve your current location. The Service may send your Location Data to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as ask information about nearby services or offerings, use search features, as well as when the Service asks for new maps for new areas you have navigated into. As further described below, Location Data may be collected when you use the traffic feature for service improvement purposes without identifying you personally.
Place Information may be sent to HERE for example when you synchronize your favorites across devices.
1.3 Traffic Improvement
Whenever you use the Service while having traffic features enabled, the Service sends, in regular intervals, your current location, speed, direction and timestamp to us to provide you and other users of the Service with better traffic service such as detect traffic jams, traffic patterns, changed road conditions and other such conditions as well as to identify new routes on the map. This information is analyzed to distinguish independent routes and traffic patterns and contains a changing identifier, which is persistent only for the duration of the route. This information is sent to us when you use the Service online. In case you are using the Service offline, we may collect this information locally on device and it may be sent to us on your next connection.
1.4 My commute
You may activate My Commute feature in the Service to let the Service learn your daily commutes and help you optimize your travel. While learning your daily commutes, the Service can start recommending optimal times for travel based on foreseen traffic situation. All the information collected by the My Commute feature, which includes information about the routes you’ve driven and places related to your commute remains only in the vehicle and is never sent outside the vehicle. Information is stored protected against unauthorized use.
You may manage your learned routes and preferences and you may turn the My Commute feature on and off via settings of the Service.
1.5 Technical information and your transactions
When you use the Service online, certain technical information such as the details of the application version, service permissions, vehicle identification number, internet protocol address, time zone, technical details of your device and connection as well as your transactions with HERE may be automatically collected by HERE.
2. Purposes and legal bases of the processing

2.1. Provision of the Services
The information collected by the Service is utilized to provide you with the service, manage our transactions and communications with you and ensure ongoing compliance with information security requirements.
When you make use of optional features, we may also use the information to provide you with improved search and recommendations to better assist you to find a place you may like. Optional features can be deactivated at any time.
Applicable legal bases are:

- your consent that you provide when downloading our mobile application, granting permission to access information on your device or when you ask us to share your data. You may revoke your consent by changing your settings at any time in Settings. Doing so will bar us from further processing of your personal data based on your consent but will not impact the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before it was withdrawn.
If you do not provide your data, such as by forgoing an account registration, we are not able to provide the features of the Service depending on such data (i.e. syncing of destinations across devices).
2.2. Developing and improving our products and services
We process your data to provide you and other users with better Service such as improving search and recommendations, better assisting you to find a place you may like or detect new routes on the map.
For this purpose, we use the traffic information collected from your drives in an anonymous manner. We do not associate your Location Data or Places Information with your other personally identifiable information, such as an InControl Navigation Account, unless you have asked us to do so. For example, we do not combine your Place Information such as favorite, recent or shared destinations with your Location Data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent associating your Location Data with other personally identifiable information without your permission.
Applicable legal bases are:
- our legitimate interest in the development and improvement of our services, ensuring that your rights are not undermined by anonymizing data and implementing other appropriate safeguards.
3. Processing and retention period
We endeavor to only collect personal data that are necessary for the purposes for which they are collected, and to retain such data for no longer than is necessary for such purposes. The length of time personal data is retained, and criteria for determining that time, are dependent on the nature of the personal data and the purpose for which it was provided. For example, for your personal data related to managing your account (such as name, email address, and account content and preferences) are maintained for as long as they are retained by you within your account. Other data, such as records of your activity within the application, are typically maintained only for a short period before being anonymized. You may contact the HERE Privacy Office at

4. Do we share your information?
Your Location Data will not be shared with other service providers or advertisers without your permission.

For example, if you choose to share your estimated time of arrival with selected individuals, you can do so either via SMS or email. We will facilitate the sharing interaction by collecting the list of recipients you have specified and by sending notification messages to the recipients of your choice.
The Service may also include content from and links to third party sites and services.
We may share your personal data:
- with your consent;
- with HERE companies and authorized third party service providers, who process personal data on our behalf;
- in exceptional cases with attorneys and advisors to protect our rights or property in court, arbitration or administrative proceedings; and
- where there is a legal requirement to do so.
5. Transborder transfers of personal data
The Service may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Therefore, your personal data may be transferred across international borders outside the country where you use our services, including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that do not have laws providing specific protection for personal data or that have different legal rules on data protection, for example, the United States of America. In such cases we ensure that there is a legal basis for such a transfer and that adequate protection for your personal data is provided as required by applicable law, for example, by relying on an adequacy decision and/or using standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or relevant authorities (where necessary) and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organizational information security measures.

privacy@HERE.com
to obtain additional information about the safeguards we take in connection with these transfers. A copy of the unchangeable Standard Contractual Clauses can be accessed at

6. Your choices
The Service offers a variety of choices to allow you to control how your Location Data and other information are collected.
You may configure individual features or feature sets of the Service to be used in offline or online mode. No Location Data or other information is sent to HERE if you only use the Service in offline mode. Note that your vehicle may nevertheless have stored information which may be sent to HERE once you establish an online connection, as defined earlier in this document.
You may choose the level at which you participate in the development of HERE’s products and services. You may disable the collection of Location Data for traffic improvement purposes by turning off the traffic service. Note that then you’re also not able to benefit from the traffic service.
You may choose to create a profile either locally in the vehicle or an InControl Navigation Account with features which help you store and synchronize your information outside the vehicle context, such as with your mobile and other devices. You may choose to enable and disable the synchronization or your favourites as well as your most recent location of your car.
If you have enabled the synchronization of the location of your parked car, the Service will automatically, or upon request, send the parked car location in association with each and every active InControl Navigation Account on the vehicle. This allows you to easily share the location of your car for example with other family members. If you don’t want to share the location of your car with other account holders, please make sure the other users are in a logged out state while you drive.
You may delete a local profile or the application from your mobile device, which will delete all locally stored information associated to your profile, such as recent destinations and recent searches. Deleting a local profile from the vehicle or the application from your mobile device will not delete any InControl Navigation Account you may have created.
You may manage account data, remove or terminate your InControl Navigation Account in the setting of your in-vehicle system or your online InControl Navigation Account. If you remove your InControl Navigation Account from the vehicle, it remains active for your future use.

If a restriction applies, we will respond to your request with an explanation of what action will be taken, to the extent required under applicable data protection law.

Location Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been. Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as Assisted GPS. In many device models the user interface of the Service identifies the use of positioning with an icon.
Asset Location relates to the location of your assigned Assets. Asset Location is based on available positioning methods, such as WiFi based positioning, Bluetooth based positioning and/or cell-tower based positioning or GPS.
When you start to use the Service application or activate the Asset, the application and the Asset activates your selected positioning methods to retrieve your current location.
The Service as well as the Asset may send your Location Data or Asset Location to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as request status of the Assets, or receive or send notifications or instructions from the Assets.
Note that to instantaneously request status of the Asset, we may need to send an SMS to the Asset. This can only be performed if you register the phone number of the Asset with HERE Tracking Service
You may simulate the behaviour of Assets by using HERE Tracker application, available from application stores for both Android and iPhone devices. The HERE Tracker application turns your mobile phone into an Asset, and starts reporting the location of your device (as an Asset) to the Service, on intervals configured by you. The reporting only takes place from the moment onwards once you have assigned your device (as an Asset) to the Service and your HERE account.
