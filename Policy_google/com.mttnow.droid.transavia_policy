b. Your contact details and your personal account or registration details
We may collect your address, telephone number and email address. If you register for a service, event, contest or campaign or create a personal account, we may also record your login details and other information you provide during registration or when completing the account form.

When you travel with us, we collect and use information about your trip, such as your itinerary, online or airport check-in, mobile or hard copy boarding pass, and information about your travelling companions.
We may also record your specific medical needs and any additional assistance you require. If biometric boarding is applicable, we usually receive a confirmation from the external party that facilitates biometric boarding (such as facial recognition) that your identity has been verified. Unless indicated otherwise, we do not receive any identifiers about you (such as facial images) other than the personal data we already have at our disposal (such as passport details). For more information on the collection and use of your personal data in the context of biometric boarding, please check the privacy policy of the organisation that facilitates the biometric boarding.
We may also be statutorily required to carry out health checks or collect your health data for public health purposes prior to boarding or disembarking.

We may also record telephone calls for training purposes or to prevent or combat fraud. We register your communication preferences. For example, when you subscribe to one of our newsletters or when you choose to receive your booking-related communication (such as confirmation, check-in notification, boarding pass and flight status updates) through channels other than email (such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger).
h. Information we collect when you use our websites, mobile apps or other digital services
• When you visit our websites, use our mobile apps or any other digital service, we may register your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring website, web browsing behaviour and app use.

k. Passengers who are unruly or misuse our services
Transavia keeps a list of passengers who have been unruly before or after the flight, or on board one of our aircraft. Unruly behaviour may include obstructing safety, disturbing public order, inflicting injury to our ground crew, crew or fellow passengers or causing damage to our property. For this list, we process the names of the passengers, their gender, date of birth, email address, flight details, a brief factual description of the incident and the severity of the unruly behaviour, the type and duration of the measures taken and, if applicable, a copy of the official report. Transavia Airlines C.V. may share a limited amount of this data (first and last name, date of birth and the duration of the imposed safety measure) with KLM (see also section 1 above). We also keep a list of passengers who misuse our services. For this purpose, we process the names, dates of birth and booking numbers of the passengers and a brief description of the incident and the severity of the misuse. For more information, see sections 3(e) and 4.1(f) below).
2.2 Special categories of personal data
Some categories of personal data, such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, health-related data, and personal data relating to criminal law matters, are subject to stricter rules under the applicable privacy laws.
We may need to collect and use these categories of personal data, for example to provide you with assistance or facilities appropriate to your medical needs during your trip, to accommodate your requests, to ensure flight safety or to comply with statutory requirements. Biometric data is also subject to stricter rules. However, explained under 2.1(d), we do not normally collect or use your biometric data.
2.3 Children younger than 16 years
We collect data about children when you provide us with information about your child in connection with a flight you book or a service or product you purchase. For children travelling alone, we note the contact details of the people who will drop them off or pick them up at the airport.
2.4. Specific services, mobile apps, events, contests or campaigns
For specific services, mobile apps, events, competitions or campaigns, we may collect other types of data than those described in this privacy policy. We will inform you of this when you register for this particular service, event, competition or campaign, or when you download the app.
3. How we collect your data
3.1 We collect the categories of personal data referred to above in the following ways:
a. Personal data provided by you
When you book a flight with us, create an online account, contact us through social media, complete a customer survey, contact our Service Centre, subscribe to receive our emails or mobile push notifications, enter a competition or register for one of our events or campaigns.
b. Personal data received from your travel agent, our airline partners and other companies involved in facilitating your trips
We receive your data from these parties to handle your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases. For example, when you book a flight through a travel agent or an online platform, we receive your identifying data and booking data from those third parties.
c. When you use our website or mobile apps, we collect information using cookies and similar technologies
Transavia uses its own cookies and third-party cookies. You can find more information in our cookie policy.
d. If you use social networks, we may also receive information from your social network provider
For more information, see 2.1(i). above.
e. If you have been unruly, we will collect certain information for flight safety purposes
If you have been unruly before or during a flight, we will make a report. In addition to the data provided to us in the context of your booking or reservation (e.g. name and date of birth), this report may also include information provided by people involved in the incident and/or responsible for handling it (see also sections 2.1(k) above and 4.1(f) below).
4. Purposes for which we use your data
4.1. Main purposes for which we use your personal data:
a. To provide our services to you
We use the information described under 2.1(a) through (k) to handle your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases. For example, we use your name, email address and other identifying information to issue your ticket. We use your contact details to inform you of changes to your flight status.
We need to know your specific medical needs to ensure you receive appropriate care. We only use this data to ensure that you receive appropriate medical care.
b. To provide you with our online services and mobile apps
•
For example, we use your name and flight details when you use our app to check in for your flight.
•
Some of our online services and apps use your location, for example to show you the nearest location of interest.
•
To provide you with the best possible digital experience, we analyse your use of digital media so that we can tailor our communication to the digital channel or device you use (see 2.1(h)).
•
If you break off your booking session on our website, we will send you an email with a link to your booking session so that you can continue where you left off. You may receive similar emails if you break off booking sessions on the websites of our partner Airtrade, which offer package deals. We will only send you such emails if you have subscribed to our newsletter or agreed to receive updates and special offers from us by email (see 4.1(d)). You can withdraw your consent to such emails at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email, changing your communication preferences in your account (if available), or by contacting us (see 8 ‘Your Rights’ below).
c. For statistical research
•
General: We examine general trends in the use of our services, websites, mobile apps, social media, as well as trends in the behaviour and preferences of our customers and users. We use our research results to develop better services and offers for our customers, provide better customer service and improve the design and content of our websites and mobile apps.
•
Categories of data: To conduct our research, we may use the categories of personal data described in 2.1(a) through (j). We only use ‘aggregated data’ or ‘pseudonymised data’ for our research. This is data that cannot be traced back to you directly because all directly identifiable elements (e.g. names and email addresses) have been removed or encoded and given a number. We take appropriate measures to ensure that only a limited group of employees has access to the data.
•
Example: If our research on booking details and data about additional services (seats, luggage) shows that passengers to certain destinations are more inclined to purchase luggage, we may use that information to offer luggage more prominently for those destinations. We also use customer surveys to measure customer satisfaction and to understand what is important to our customers. We combine data from our customer surveys with details about your booking to analyse, for example, whether certain preferences occur frequently with bookings of a similar size.
•
The legal basis and the right to object: We collect and use your personal data for our legitimate interests described above (see ‘General’). You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for statistical purposes under grounds related to your specific circumstances (see below, 8 ‘Your rights’).
d. Marketing purposes
i. General: We may use your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This section explains how we use your data for these purposes.
ii. Channels: We use various channels such as email, mobile push notifications, advertising space on websites and social media channels. For example:
• Display relevant information and personalised advertisements on websites, apps and via social media platforms: we may add the information we collect through cookies and similar technologies (for more information, see 2.1 (h) above) to other information we already have about you. For example, regarding your current or past booking/bookings, to personalise our websites and apps and make them more relevant for you, and to show you personalised advertisements and offers on the social media platforms you use, by means of audience targeting. We may also use your personal data to exclude you from advertisements that are no longer relevant to you.
We use Census services to manage the collected data and create segments of user visitors based on target groups. To determine our target audiences for specific campaigns, we may use data we collect during your interactions with our websites, mobile apps or other digital media.
We can then synchronise these segments in real-time with various (social media) platforms such as Google, Meta, DeployTeq, Pega, Xandr and TikTok. In order to enable these platforms to determine whether you have an account, we can share certain data, such as a pseudonymised (hashed) email address. With Census, we can also recognise you on the various (social media) platforms you use based on this information. This helps us to determine more precisely which target groups are relevant for specific campaigns. Please consult the privacy policies of these social media platforms for more information.
• Custom audience targeting through Meta: you can choose to receive personalised advertisements and offers on the social media platforms you use.
For example, we use the Facebook Custom Audience programme. Among other things, this programme enables us to display personalised advertisements and offers in your newsfeed on Meta platforms, including Facebook Messenger and Instagram. We can also use this programme to exclude you from advertising campaigns on Meta platforms, if for example you have already received similar advertisements or offers by email.
To enable Meta to determine whether you have a Meta account, we share your pseudonymised (hashed) email address with Meta. We do not share any other data with Meta. In turn, Meta only provides us with aggregated data on the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. This is data that cannot be traced directly back to you. In this way, we do our utmost to keep your personal data secure and confidential.
To determine our target group for a specific Meta campaign, we may use your booking details or the data we collect when you use our websites, mobile apps or other digital media. In addition, Meta may use the personal data it collects about you to compile a similar target group. This allows us to reach a new target group through Meta.
Read more about how Meta uses your data for its custom audience programme and how you can control how Meta uses information about you to personalise the advertisements that you see. You can also check Meta’s privacy policy.
If you no longer want us to include you in our social media custom audience targeting programmes, you can refuse the use of cookies through your browser settings or revoke options. For more information, please also read our
cookie policy
.
iii. Personalised offers: We aim to make advertisements and offers as relevant as possible for you. For this reason, we may analyse the categories of personal data described in point 2.1, under (a) through (j) and point 4.1 under c). We use the results of this analysis to personalise advertisements and offers. For example, after you have returned from a trip we may send you an email with offers based on your booking history, to give you inspiration for your next trip. We may also use your booking history (e.g. destination, travel period) to make you personalised offers and to tailor our website and the booking process on our website to you.
iv. Legal basis and right to object: Unless indicated otherwise, we collect and use your personal data as described in this section 4.1(d) for our legitimate interests and those of third parties. You have the right to object at any time to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including related profiling activities (see 8 ‘Your rights’ below).
•
Opt-in and opt-out, unsubscribe and right to object. We only send you emails with updates and special offers if you not opt-out during the booking process. You can unsubscribe from these emails with updates and special offers at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email, by changing your communication preferences in your account (if available) or by contacting us (see 8 'Your rights' below). When you unsubscribe, you will still receive our booking related service emails (such as your booking confirmation, boarding pass and welcome email). If you have opted to receive personalised advertisements and offers through mobile push notifications, you can unsubscribe by changing your smartphone settings (for mobile push notifications). Visit the website of your social network provider for more information on how to unsubscribe from receiving personalised advertisements and offers through social channels. You may object at any time to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (see below ‘Your rights’).
•
Marketing cookies. Our websites use marketing cookies which are typically placed by advertising networks. These networks are companies that act as intermediaries between Transavia and advertisers. These marketing cookies are used, among other things, to show you relevant, personalised advertisements or offers (based on your visit and click behaviour on our websites) when you visit those networks or connected websites. For more information about these marketing cookies and how to withdraw your consent for these cookies, please see our
cookie policy
.
•
Linked site behaviour. When you log in to our website using your My Transavia account or if you visit our websites via a link in an email, we link your site behaviour to your booking data on our data management platform. We mainly use this data to exclude you from further advertising once you have booked a flight. For example, when you search for a flight on our main website, marketing cookies will be used to show you relevant advertisements (see previous section). When you book a flight through one of our other websites or with one of our group companies, we will stop showing you advertisements through marketing cookies based on your search behaviour on our main website.
e. To communicate with you
•
We use your contact details to communicate with you in relation to our services or loyalty programmes, to answer your questions or to handle your complaints.
f. To ensure flight safety and prevent misuse
•
Transavia keeps a list of passengers who have been unruly or misused our services (see also section 2.1(k) and 3(e) above). Depending on the severity of the conduct, we can either (1) only allow these passengers on board under certain conditions for a period of three years, or (2) Transavia Airlines C.V. refuse passengers on flights for five years. In case of aggravating circumstances (such as repeated misconduct) Transavia Airlines C.V. can in specific cases decide to refuse a passenger on flights for more than five years. In very serious cases, Transavia Airlines C.V. can even decide to refuse a passenger for life. Special information regarding children: Children under the age of 15 who have been unruly will not be placed on the list by Transavia. For children aged 15 to 16, Transavia can decide that for a maximum period of one year, they are only allowed on board under certain conditions. Passengers on the lists will be personally informed (by email if possible) of the fact that they have been placed on the list and why, what security measures have been taken against them, how long these apply to them and where they can lodge a complaint or object to the inclusion. For more information on how to view or amend this data, see section 8 ‘Your rights’ below.
g. To conduct our business operations or to comply with legal obligations
•
We collect, use, and retain your personal data to perform our business activities, such as for administrative purposes, to prevent or combat fraud or to settle disputes. In the event of fraud or misuse of our services, we may include your personal data in our internal fraud control and warning systems. As a result of this, your bookings may be subject to careful scrutiny and may be rejected or cancelled in certain cases, or you may no longer be welcome on board our aircraft or only under certain conditions (see 4.1f) above). We also collect and use your personal data to comply with our legal and tax obligations.
4.2 Specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns
For specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns, we may use your personal data for purposes other than those described in this privacy policy. We will inform you about those purposes when you register for the service, event, contest, or campaign, or when you download the relevant app.
4.3 Legal basis
We may only collect and use your personal data if we have a legal basis for doing so. In many cases, we need your personal data to receive your booking, arrange your flight or purchases, or answer your questions (see 4.1(a), (b) and (e) above). In these cases, the legal basis for processing your data is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract’.
If you have consented to the collection and use of your personal data (you can withdraw this consent at any time, see section 8 ‘Your rights’ below), we will collect and use your data based on that consent.
In certain cases, we may use your personal details when we or a third party have a legitimate interest in doing so. We always carefully consider all interests: your interests, those of others and those of Transavia. On that legal basis, we will collect and use your data for, for example, flight safety purposes, statistical research, direct marketing purposes or to provide you with personalised offers (see 4.1(b), (c), (d) and (f) above for more information).
We may also have a legal obligation to use your data, for example to meet immigration formalities (see 4.1, under g), above).
If you refuse to provide the personal data we need to fulfil the contract we have concluded with you or to comply with a legal obligation, we may not be able to provide all the services you have requested from us. Consequently, we may have to cancel your flight, or we may not be able to provide you with the additional services you have requested. If you provide incomplete or inaccurate information, we may be forced to deny you boarding or entry into a foreign territory.
5. Granting access to or sharing data with third parties
5.1 General
We may share your personal data with third parties in the following cases.
a. To facilitate your bookings and trips
To process your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases, we often need to share your personal data with our group companies, partner airlines, airport operators and other companies involved in facilitating your trip (see 3.1(b) above, ‘How we collect your data’).
b. For support or additional services
To provide our services, we use the support or additional services of third parties, such as IT suppliers, social media providers, marketing agencies and screening service providers. All these third parties are obliged to adequately secure your personal data and only use this data in accordance with our instructions.
Transavia and Transavia France conduct their business activities using centralised databases and systems. These centralised databases and systems may be hosted by one of the two parties or managed for the other. In addition, for efficiency purposes, certain operational functions may be performed by one party for the other. That means that Transavia and Transavia France could have access to your personal data for these purposes. Transavia and Transavia France may only use your personal data to the extent required for the relevant business function and according to this privacy policy.
c. For the Flying Blue programme
If you choose to 'earn' and/or 'spend' miles on Transavia products, we share your personal data with Flying Blue. For more information on how KLM and Air France handle your personal data in this regard, please check their privacy policies.
d. Payment services
To process payments for your trips and purchases, we may work with third-party payment service providers. In many cases, these payment service providers also perform fraud checks. These providers have their own privacy policies regarding the way they use your personal data.
e. Personalised marketing via social media platforms
For more information, see 4.1(d) under ‘Purposes for which we use your data’.
f. To allow our partners to tailor their services to your trip
We may share your non-personal data (destination, date of travel and duration of the trip) with partners offering additional services (e.g. hotel accommodation, car rental services) so that they can send you offers tailored to your trip. Our partners have their own privacy policies regarding the way they use your personal data.
5.2 Specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns
For specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns, we may share your data with third parties other than those described in this privacy policy, for example, when we organise a campaign or an event in collaboration with a partner or when we integrate their services into our apps. We will inform you about this when you register for the service, event, contest, or campaign, or when you download the app.
5.3 Exchanging your details with KLM
Airlines have an obligation to ensure flight safety. To this end, Transavia implements certain (necessary) safety measures. For example, Transavia keeps a record of passengers who have been unruly on the ground or on board (see section 2.1(k), 3(e) and 4.1(f) above). Based on this list we may (1) only allow said passengers on board under certain conditions for a period of three years, or (2) refuse them on board for a certain period. KLM, a group company of Transavia, keeps a similar list. To increase the scope of the internal safety measures taken, Transavia Airlines C.V. and KLM exchange the personal data of passengers who have been denied boarding for a certain period of time (see section 1 above). A person denied boarding by Transavia Airlines C.V. is now also denied boarding on KLM flights (and vice versa). If you have been unruly and this has led to your inclusion on the list, you will be informed personally by the airline where the disturbance occurred.
5.4. Government agencies
(A) General
We may be legally required to collect your personal data before you travel to another country and share it with the government agencies in the countries on your itinerary. For example, we may be legally required to collect and share your identifying data and your booking and travel information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of border control, immigration formalities, entering a country or combatting terrorism or other serious crimes (see 5.4(B) below). We may also be legally required to share your health data with the government agencies in the countries on your itinerary for public health purposes (see 2.1(d) above).
(B) PNR and API data
i. General: Under European and national regulations (including Dutch regulations implementing the PNR Directive (EU2016/281) and the API Directive (EU2004/82)) and international treaties, Transavia must provide so-called PNR and API data to authorised government agencies, such as Passenger Information Units (PIUs). PNR (Passenger Name Record) concerns all information about your bookings, such as flight information, passengers in the booking and payment information. PNR data are used by government agencies for law enforcement purposes, including combating illegal trade and terrorism. API (Advance Passenger Information) concerns information about your flight and passport details. API details are mainly used by government agencies to reduce illegal immigration through improved border control. Transavia France provides these PNR details, for example, to the French PIU in the case of flights to and from France (excluding domestic flights). In the case of flights by Transavia Netherlands, these PNR details are provided to the Dutch PIU (Pi-NL) for flights to and from the Netherlands. Where required by the law of the country of destination, we may also provide your API and PNR details to authorities in countries other than France and the Netherlands. In your booking, we will indicate when we are obliged to do so.
ii. Specific conditions per country:
- France: Pursuant to Article L 237 -7 of the French Homeland Security Code, we may be required to provide your reservation, checking and boarding data (API/PNR) to the French national government agencies and competent authorities for the purposes of and subject to conditions defined in Decree No. 2014-1095 of 26 September 2014, as amended by Decree No. 2018/714 of 3 August 2018.
5.5. Third party websites
Our websites and mobile apps contain links to third-party websites. If you follow these links, you leave our websites or mobile apps. This privacy policy does not apply to the third-party websites. For more information on how third parties handle your personal data, please check their privacy and/or cookie policies (if available).
6. Security and retention
6.1 Security
Transavia will take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against loss or unlawful use.
How to protect yourself?
Everyone plays an important role in protecting the security and confidentiality of personal data. If you make a booking, you will be sent file references. These booking references must remain confidential at all times. Disclosing them to other passengers may allow them to access your booking details through our systems or those of third parties involved in the providing your trip (e.g. travel agencies or online search and booking sites). If you are travelling with others and do not want your personal details disclosed to them, we recommend making separate reservations.
We also recommend that you do not disclose the passwords you use to access our services to third parties, that you systematically log out of your profile and social account (especially in the case of linked accounts) and that you close the browser window at the end of your session, especially if you are using the internet on a public computer. This prevents other users from accessing your personal data. To avoid the risk of hacking, we recommend using different passwords for each online service you use. We cannot be held liable for the theft of your data on a platform that is not managed by us.
In addition, we strongly recommend that you not to provide to third parties any documents issued by Transavia containing your personal data (your boarding card, ticket number, etc.) or any other information related to your trip or to publish them on social networks. If you decide to publish these documents on social media, you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions of use, information security practices and privacy policies applicable to those third-party social networks. We cannot be held liable for how data is processed, stored or disclosed on these platforms.
6.2 Retention
Your personal data will be retained for as long as is required for the purposes described in this privacy policy or to the extent necessary to comply with legal obligations and for the resolution of any disputes. In principle, we save booking and payment details in our booking and payment systems for four to seven years. We do so to fulfil our fiscal retention obligation. We save the data in our customer system for three to six years, so that we can answer claims within the applicable time limit.
When you create an account with Transavia, we save these details for as long as your account is active. Even if you have not created an account, we save your data longer when you have given permission for that or when we have a legitimate interest to do so. Of course, you can always exercise one of your rights as stated in section 8 of this privacy policy.
7. International transfer of your data
7.1
Transavia may transfer your personal data to countries other than your country of residence (including countries outside the European Economic Area). This is done to handle your booking or arrange your trip, or because our group companies, partners, or service providers provide their services from other countries. You can find the destinations we fly to on our website. The laws of the countries to which we transfer your personal data may not always offer the same level of personal data protection.
7.2
If you fly to a destination in a country other than your country of residence, transferring your personal data to that country is often necessary to provide our services to you. If this seems necessary, Transavia will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to comply with the requirements for the international transfer of personal data under applicable privacy laws. For transfers of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area, Transavia may use European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses as safeguards.
7.3
We may be obliged to provide your personal data to governmental agencies in the countries of your itinerary (see 5.4 above).
8. Your rights
8.1
You can contact our Privacy Office (see 8.4 below) to exercise your rights under applicable data protection laws, including (1) the right to access your data, (2) the right to rectify your data, (3) the right to erasure, (4) the right to restrict the processing of your data, (5) the right to data portability and (6) the right to object to processing.
1. Right of access
You can ask us whether we collect or use any of your personal data and, if so, you have the right to access that data in the form of a copy. To submit a request for access to your personal data, please use our
online form
.
2. Right to rectification and completion
You have the right to have your data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. On request, we will correct inaccurate personal data about you and, considering the purposes of the processing, supplement incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a supplementary statement.
3. Right to (data) erasure
You have the right to have your personal data deleted. This means that we will delete your data. Erasure of your personal data only takes place in certain cases, as prescribed by law and listed in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes situations where your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally processed and situations where your data has been unlawfully processed. To submit a request for the deletion of your personal data, please use our
online form
.
4. Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. This means that we will suspend the processing of your data for a certain period. Circumstances which may give rise to this right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data is being contested and we need time to verify its accuracy or inaccuracy. This right does not prevent us from continuing to store your personal data. We will inform you before the restriction is lifted.
5. Right to data portability
Your right to data portability means that you can request us to provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have such data transferred directly to another data controller, insofar as technically feasible. On request and to the extent this is technically feasible, we will transfer your personal data directly to the other controller.
6. Right to object
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data. This means that you can ask us to stop processing your personal data. This only applies if the ground of ‘legitimate interests’ (including profiling) constitutes the legal basis for processing (see 4.3 ‘Legal basis’ above).
You may object, at any time and free of charge, to direct marketing if your personal data is processed for such purposes, including profiling if it relates to direct marketing. If you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data for such purposes.
8.2 Withdrawal of consent
You may withdraw your consent at any time by following the specific instructions related to the processing for which you have your consent. For example, you can withdraw your consent by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email, changing your communication preferences in your account (if available) or changing your smartphone settings (for mobile push notifications and location data).
You can also contact the Transavia Privacy Office. For more information on how to withdraw your consent to cookies and similar technologies that we use when you visit our websites or use mobile apps, please check our
cookie policy
.
8.3 Denial or restriction of rights
There may be situations in which we are entitled to deny or limit your rights as described in 8.1 above. In all cases, we will carefully consider whether such an exemption applies and inform you accordingly.
For example, we may deny your request for access if it is necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other people or refuse to erase your personal data if the processing of such data is necessary to comply with legal obligations. The right to data portability, for example, does not apply if the personal data has not been provided by you or if we process the data on grounds other than your consent or for the performance of a contract.

When you travel with us, we collect and use information about your trip, such as your itinerary, online or airport check-in, mobile or hard copy boarding pass, and information about your travelling companions.
We may also record your specific medical needs and any additional assistance you require. If biometric boarding is applicable, we usually receive a confirmation from the external party that facilitates biometric boarding (such as facial recognition) that your identity has been verified. Unless indicated otherwise, we do not receive any identifiers about you (such as facial images) other than the personal data we already have at our disposal (such as passport details). For more information on the collection and use of your personal data in the context of biometric boarding, please check the privacy policy of the organisation that facilitates the biometric boarding.
We may also be statutorily required to carry out health checks or collect your health data for public health purposes prior to boarding or disembarking.

g. Our communication with you
When you send us an email or chat with us online or via social media, we register your messages. If you call us, our Service Centre registers your questions or complaints in our database. We may also record telephone calls for training purposes or to prevent or combat fraud. We register your communication preferences. For example, when you subscribe to one of our newsletters or when you choose to receive your booking-related communication (such as confirmation, check-in notification, boarding pass and flight status updates) through channels other than email (such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger).
h. Information we collect when you use our websites, mobile apps or other digital services
• When you visit our websites, use our mobile apps or any other digital service, we may register your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring website, web browsing behaviour and app use. We collect this information through cookies and similar technologies. We may add the information we collect through cookies and similar technologies to other information we already have about you. For example, regarding your current or past booking/bookings, to personalise our website and make it more relevant for you. You can find more information in our
cookie policy
.
• We use Google services, such as Google Analytics (including Google Signals) and Google Enhanced Conversion. Google’s website explains how Google uses the data from sites and apps that use Google’s services. Our cookie policy also explains which Google services we use.
• We receive an automatic notification when you open our emails or click on a link in such emails in DeployTeq. We may combine this information with other data we already have about you.
• With your consent, we may receive your location data.

k. Passengers who are unruly or misuse our services
Transavia keeps a list of passengers who have been unruly before or after the flight, or on board one of our aircraft. Unruly behaviour may include obstructing safety, disturbing public order, inflicting injury to our ground crew, crew or fellow passengers or causing damage to our property. For this list, we process the names of the passengers, their gender, date of birth, email address, flight details, a brief factual description of the incident and the severity of the unruly behaviour, the type and duration of the measures taken and, if applicable, a copy of the official report. Transavia Airlines C.V. may share a limited amount of this data (first and last name, date of birth and the duration of the imposed safety measure) with KLM (see also section 1 above). We also keep a list of passengers who misuse our services. For this purpose, we process the names, dates of birth and booking numbers of the passengers and a brief description of the incident and the severity of the misuse. For more information, see sections 3(e) and 4.1(f) below).
2.2 Special categories of personal data
Some categories of personal data, such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, health-related data, and personal data relating to criminal law matters, are subject to stricter rules under the applicable privacy laws.
We may need to collect and use these categories of personal data, for example to provide you with assistance or facilities appropriate to your medical needs during your trip, to accommodate your requests, to ensure flight safety or to comply with statutory requirements. Biometric data is also subject to stricter rules. However, explained under 2.1(d), we do not normally collect or use your biometric data.
2.3 Children younger than 16 years
We collect data about children when you provide us with information about your child in connection with a flight you book or a service or product you purchase. For children travelling alone, we note the contact details of the people who will drop them off or pick them up at the airport.
2.4. Specific services, mobile apps, events, contests or campaigns
For specific services, mobile apps, events, competitions or campaigns, we may collect other types of data than those described in this privacy policy. We will inform you of this when you register for this particular service, event, competition or campaign, or when you download the app.
3. How we collect your data
3.1 We collect the categories of personal data referred to above in the following ways:
a. Personal data provided by you
When you book a flight with us, create an online account, contact us through social media, complete a customer survey, contact our Service Centre, subscribe to receive our emails or mobile push notifications, enter a competition or register for one of our events or campaigns.
b. Personal data received from your travel agent, our airline partners and other companies involved in facilitating your trips
We receive your data from these parties to handle your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases. For example, when you book a flight through a travel agent or an online platform, we receive your identifying data and booking data from those third parties.
c. When you use our website or mobile apps, we collect information using cookies and similar technologies
Transavia uses its own cookies and third-party cookies. You can find more information in our cookie policy.
d. If you use social networks, we may also receive information from your social network provider
For more information, see 2.1(i). above.
e. If you have been unruly, we will collect certain information for flight safety purposes
If you have been unruly before or during a flight, we will make a report. In addition to the data provided to us in the context of your booking or reservation (e.g. name and date of birth), this report may also include information provided by people involved in the incident and/or responsible for handling it (see also sections 2.1(k) above and 4.1(f) below).
4. Purposes for which we use your data
4.1. Main purposes for which we use your personal data:
a. To provide our services to you
We use the information described under 2.1(a) through (k) to handle your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases. For example, we use your name, email address and other identifying information to issue your ticket. We use your contact details to inform you of changes to your flight status.
We need to know your specific medical needs to ensure you receive appropriate care. We only use this data to ensure that you receive appropriate medical care.
b. To provide you with our online services and mobile apps
•
For example, we use your name and flight details when you use our app to check in for your flight.
•
Some of our online services and apps use your location, for example to show you the nearest location of interest.
•
To provide you with the best possible digital experience, we analyse your use of digital media so that we can tailor our communication to the digital channel or device you use (see 2.1(h)).
•
If you break off your booking session on our website, we will send you an email with a link to your booking session so that you can continue where you left off. You may receive similar emails if you break off booking sessions on the websites of our partner Airtrade, which offer package deals. We will only send you such emails if you have subscribed to our newsletter or agreed to receive updates and special offers from us by email (see 4.1(d)). You can withdraw your consent to such emails at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email, changing your communication preferences in your account (if available), or by contacting us (see 8 ‘Your Rights’ below).
c. For statistical research
•
General: We examine general trends in the use of our services, websites, mobile apps, social media, as well as trends in the behaviour and preferences of our customers and users. We use our research results to develop better services and offers for our customers, provide better customer service and improve the design and content of our websites and mobile apps.
•
Categories of data: To conduct our research, we may use the categories of personal data described in 2.1(a) through (j). We only use ‘aggregated data’ or ‘pseudonymised data’ for our research. This is data that cannot be traced back to you directly because all directly identifiable elements (e.g. names and email addresses) have been removed or encoded and given a number. We take appropriate measures to ensure that only a limited group of employees has access to the data.
•
Example: If our research on booking details and data about additional services (seats, luggage) shows that passengers to certain destinations are more inclined to purchase luggage, we may use that information to offer luggage more prominently for those destinations. We also use customer surveys to measure customer satisfaction and to understand what is important to our customers. We combine data from our customer surveys with details about your booking to analyse, for example, whether certain preferences occur frequently with bookings of a similar size.
•
The legal basis and the right to object: We collect and use your personal data for our legitimate interests described above (see ‘General’). You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for statistical purposes under grounds related to your specific circumstances (see below, 8 ‘Your rights’).
d. Marketing purposes
i. General: We may use your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This section explains how we use your data for these purposes.
ii. Channels: We use various channels such as email, mobile push notifications, advertising space on websites and social media channels. For example:
• Display relevant information and personalised advertisements on websites, apps and via social media platforms: we may add the information we collect through cookies and similar technologies (for more information, see 2.1 (h) above) to other information we already have about you. For example, regarding your current or past booking/bookings, to personalise our websites and apps and make them more relevant for you, and to show you personalised advertisements and offers on the social media platforms you use, by means of audience targeting. We may also use your personal data to exclude you from advertisements that are no longer relevant to you.
We use Census services to manage the collected data and create segments of user visitors based on target groups. To determine our target audiences for specific campaigns, we may use data we collect during your interactions with our websites, mobile apps or other digital media.
We can then synchronise these segments in real-time with various (social media) platforms such as Google, Meta, DeployTeq, Pega, Xandr and TikTok. In order to enable these platforms to determine whether you have an account, we can share certain data, such as a pseudonymised (hashed) email address. With Census, we can also recognise you on the various (social media) platforms you use based on this information. This helps us to determine more precisely which target groups are relevant for specific campaigns. Please consult the privacy policies of these social media platforms for more information.
• Custom audience targeting through Meta: you can choose to receive personalised advertisements and offers on the social media platforms you use.
For example, we use the Facebook Custom Audience programme. Among other things, this programme enables us to display personalised advertisements and offers in your newsfeed on Meta platforms, including Facebook Messenger and Instagram. We can also use this programme to exclude you from advertising campaigns on Meta platforms, if for example you have already received similar advertisements or offers by email.
To enable Meta to determine whether you have a Meta account, we share your pseudonymised (hashed) email address with Meta. We do not share any other data with Meta. In turn, Meta only provides us with aggregated data on the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. This is data that cannot be traced directly back to you. In this way, we do our utmost to keep your personal data secure and confidential.
To determine our target group for a specific Meta campaign, we may use your booking details or the data we collect when you use our websites, mobile apps or other digital media. In addition, Meta may use the personal data it collects about you to compile a similar target group. This allows us to reach a new target group through Meta.
Read more about how Meta uses your data for its custom audience programme and how you can control how Meta uses information about you to personalise the advertisements that you see. You can also check Meta’s privacy policy.
If you no longer want us to include you in our social media custom audience targeting programmes, you can refuse the use of cookies through your browser settings or revoke options. For more information, please also read our
cookie policy
.
iii. Personalised offers: We aim to make advertisements and offers as relevant as possible for you. For this reason, we may analyse the categories of personal data described in point 2.1, under (a) through (j) and point 4.1 under c). We use the results of this analysis to personalise advertisements and offers. For example, after you have returned from a trip we may send you an email with offers based on your booking history, to give you inspiration for your next trip. We may also use your booking history (e.g. destination, travel period) to make you personalised offers and to tailor our website and the booking process on our website to you.
iv. Legal basis and right to object: Unless indicated otherwise, we collect and use your personal data as described in this section 4.1(d) for our legitimate interests and those of third parties. You have the right to object at any time to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including related profiling activities (see 8 ‘Your rights’ below).
•
Opt-in and opt-out, unsubscribe and right to object. We only send you emails with updates and special offers if you not opt-out during the booking process. You can unsubscribe from these emails with updates and special offers at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email, by changing your communication preferences in your account (if available) or by contacting us (see 8 'Your rights' below). When you unsubscribe, you will still receive our booking related service emails (such as your booking confirmation, boarding pass and welcome email). If you have opted to receive personalised advertisements and offers through mobile push notifications, you can unsubscribe by changing your smartphone settings (for mobile push notifications). Visit the website of your social network provider for more information on how to unsubscribe from receiving personalised advertisements and offers through social channels. You may object at any time to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (see below ‘Your rights’).
•
Marketing cookies. Our websites use marketing cookies which are typically placed by advertising networks. These networks are companies that act as intermediaries between Transavia and advertisers. These marketing cookies are used, among other things, to show you relevant, personalised advertisements or offers (based on your visit and click behaviour on our websites) when you visit those networks or connected websites. For more information about these marketing cookies and how to withdraw your consent for these cookies, please see our
cookie policy
.
•
Linked site behaviour. When you log in to our website using your My Transavia account or if you visit our websites via a link in an email, we link your site behaviour to your booking data on our data management platform. We mainly use this data to exclude you from further advertising once you have booked a flight. For example, when you search for a flight on our main website, marketing cookies will be used to show you relevant advertisements (see previous section). When you book a flight through one of our other websites or with one of our group companies, we will stop showing you advertisements through marketing cookies based on your search behaviour on our main website.
e. To communicate with you
•
We use your contact details to communicate with you in relation to our services or loyalty programmes, to answer your questions or to handle your complaints.
f. To ensure flight safety and prevent misuse
•
Transavia keeps a list of passengers who have been unruly or misused our services (see also section 2.1(k) and 3(e) above). Depending on the severity of the conduct, we can either (1) only allow these passengers on board under certain conditions for a period of three years, or (2) Transavia Airlines C.V. refuse passengers on flights for five years. In case of aggravating circumstances (such as repeated misconduct) Transavia Airlines C.V. can in specific cases decide to refuse a passenger on flights for more than five years. In very serious cases, Transavia Airlines C.V. can even decide to refuse a passenger for life. Special information regarding children: Children under the age of 15 who have been unruly will not be placed on the list by Transavia. For children aged 15 to 16, Transavia can decide that for a maximum period of one year, they are only allowed on board under certain conditions. Passengers on the lists will be personally informed (by email if possible) of the fact that they have been placed on the list and why, what security measures have been taken against them, how long these apply to them and where they can lodge a complaint or object to the inclusion. For more information on how to view or amend this data, see section 8 ‘Your rights’ below.
g. To conduct our business operations or to comply with legal obligations
•
We collect, use, and retain your personal data to perform our business activities, such as for administrative purposes, to prevent or combat fraud or to settle disputes. In the event of fraud or misuse of our services, we may include your personal data in our internal fraud control and warning systems. As a result of this, your bookings may be subject to careful scrutiny and may be rejected or cancelled in certain cases, or you may no longer be welcome on board our aircraft or only under certain conditions (see 4.1f) above). We also collect and use your personal data to comply with our legal and tax obligations.
4.2 Specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns
For specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns, we may use your personal data for purposes other than those described in this privacy policy. We will inform you about those purposes when you register for the service, event, contest, or campaign, or when you download the relevant app.
4.3 Legal basis
We may only collect and use your personal data if we have a legal basis for doing so. In many cases, we need your personal data to receive your booking, arrange your flight or purchases, or answer your questions (see 4.1(a), (b) and (e) above). In these cases, the legal basis for processing your data is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract’.
If you have consented to the collection and use of your personal data (you can withdraw this consent at any time, see section 8 ‘Your rights’ below), we will collect and use your data based on that consent.
In certain cases, we may use your personal details when we or a third party have a legitimate interest in doing so. We always carefully consider all interests: your interests, those of others and those of Transavia. On that legal basis, we will collect and use your data for, for example, flight safety purposes, statistical research, direct marketing purposes or to provide you with personalised offers (see 4.1(b), (c), (d) and (f) above for more information).
We may also have a legal obligation to use your data, for example to meet immigration formalities (see 4.1, under g), above).
If you refuse to provide the personal data we need to fulfil the contract we have concluded with you or to comply with a legal obligation, we may not be able to provide all the services you have requested from us. Consequently, we may have to cancel your flight, or we may not be able to provide you with the additional services you have requested. If you provide incomplete or inaccurate information, we may be forced to deny you boarding or entry into a foreign territory.
5. Granting access to or sharing data with third parties
5.1 General
We may share your personal data with third parties in the following cases.
a. To facilitate your bookings and trips
To process your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases, we often need to share your personal data with our group companies, partner airlines, airport operators and other companies involved in facilitating your trip (see 3.1(b) above, ‘How we collect your data’).
b. For support or additional services
To provide our services, we use the support or additional services of third parties, such as IT suppliers, social media providers, marketing agencies and screening service providers. All these third parties are obliged to adequately secure your personal data and only use this data in accordance with our instructions.
Transavia and Transavia France conduct their business activities using centralised databases and systems. These centralised databases and systems may be hosted by one of the two parties or managed for the other. In addition, for efficiency purposes, certain operational functions may be performed by one party for the other. That means that Transavia and Transavia France could have access to your personal data for these purposes. Transavia and Transavia France may only use your personal data to the extent required for the relevant business function and according to this privacy policy.
c. For the Flying Blue programme
If you choose to 'earn' and/or 'spend' miles on Transavia products, we share your personal data with Flying Blue. For more information on how KLM and Air France handle your personal data in this regard, please check their privacy policies.
d. Payment services
To process payments for your trips and purchases, we may work with third-party payment service providers. In many cases, these payment service providers also perform fraud checks. These providers have their own privacy policies regarding the way they use your personal data.
e. Personalised marketing via social media platforms
For more information, see 4.1(d) under ‘Purposes for which we use your data’.
f. To allow our partners to tailor their services to your trip
We may share your non-personal data (destination, date of travel and duration of the trip) with partners offering additional services (e.g. hotel accommodation, car rental services) so that they can send you offers tailored to your trip. Our partners have their own privacy policies regarding the way they use your personal data.
5.2 Specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns
For specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns, we may share your data with third parties other than those described in this privacy policy, for example, when we organise a campaign or an event in collaboration with a partner or when we integrate their services into our apps. We will inform you about this when you register for the service, event, contest, or campaign, or when you download the app.
5.3 Exchanging your details with KLM
Airlines have an obligation to ensure flight safety. To this end, Transavia implements certain (necessary) safety measures. For example, Transavia keeps a record of passengers who have been unruly on the ground or on board (see section 2.1(k), 3(e) and 4.1(f) above). Based on this list we may (1) only allow said passengers on board under certain conditions for a period of three years, or (2) refuse them on board for a certain period. KLM, a group company of Transavia, keeps a similar list. To increase the scope of the internal safety measures taken, Transavia Airlines C.V. and KLM exchange the personal data of passengers who have been denied boarding for a certain period of time (see section 1 above). A person denied boarding by Transavia Airlines C.V. is now also denied boarding on KLM flights (and vice versa). If you have been unruly and this has led to your inclusion on the list, you will be informed personally by the airline where the disturbance occurred.
5.4. Government agencies
(A) General
We may be legally required to collect your personal data before you travel to another country and share it with the government agencies in the countries on your itinerary. For example, we may be legally required to collect and share your identifying data and your booking and travel information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of border control, immigration formalities, entering a country or combatting terrorism or other serious crimes (see 5.4(B) below). We may also be legally required to share your health data with the government agencies in the countries on your itinerary for public health purposes (see 2.1(d) above).
(B) PNR and API data
i. General: Under European and national regulations (including Dutch regulations implementing the PNR Directive (EU2016/281) and the API Directive (EU2004/82)) and international treaties, Transavia must provide so-called PNR and API data to authorised government agencies, such as Passenger Information Units (PIUs). PNR (Passenger Name Record) concerns all information about your bookings, such as flight information, passengers in the booking and payment information. PNR data are used by government agencies for law enforcement purposes, including combating illegal trade and terrorism. API (Advance Passenger Information) concerns information about your flight and passport details. API details are mainly used by government agencies to reduce illegal immigration through improved border control. Transavia France provides these PNR details, for example, to the French PIU in the case of flights to and from France (excluding domestic flights). In the case of flights by Transavia Netherlands, these PNR details are provided to the Dutch PIU (Pi-NL) for flights to and from the Netherlands. Where required by the law of the country of destination, we may also provide your API and PNR details to authorities in countries other than France and the Netherlands. In your booking, we will indicate when we are obliged to do so.
ii. Specific conditions per country:
- France: Pursuant to Article L 237 -7 of the French Homeland Security Code, we may be required to provide your reservation, checking and boarding data (API/PNR) to the French national government agencies and competent authorities for the purposes of and subject to conditions defined in Decree No. 2014-1095 of 26 September 2014, as amended by Decree No. 2018/714 of 3 August 2018.
5.5. Third party websites
Our websites and mobile apps contain links to third-party websites. If you follow these links, you leave our websites or mobile apps. This privacy policy does not apply to the third-party websites. For more information on how third parties handle your personal data, please check their privacy and/or cookie policies (if available).
6. Security and retention
6.1 Security
Transavia will take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against loss or unlawful use.
How to protect yourself?
Everyone plays an important role in protecting the security and confidentiality of personal data. If you make a booking, you will be sent file references. These booking references must remain confidential at all times. Disclosing them to other passengers may allow them to access your booking details through our systems or those of third parties involved in the providing your trip (e.g. travel agencies or online search and booking sites). If you are travelling with others and do not want your personal details disclosed to them, we recommend making separate reservations.
We also recommend that you do not disclose the passwords you use to access our services to third parties, that you systematically log out of your profile and social account (especially in the case of linked accounts) and that you close the browser window at the end of your session, especially if you are using the internet on a public computer. This prevents other users from accessing your personal data. To avoid the risk of hacking, we recommend using different passwords for each online service you use. We cannot be held liable for the theft of your data on a platform that is not managed by us.
In addition, we strongly recommend that you not to provide to third parties any documents issued by Transavia containing your personal data (your boarding card, ticket number, etc.) or any other information related to your trip or to publish them on social networks. If you decide to publish these documents on social media, you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions of use, information security practices and privacy policies applicable to those third-party social networks. We cannot be held liable for how data is processed, stored or disclosed on these platforms.
6.2 Retention
Your personal data will be retained for as long as is required for the purposes described in this privacy policy or to the extent necessary to comply with legal obligations and for the resolution of any disputes. In principle, we save booking and payment details in our booking and payment systems for four to seven years. We do so to fulfil our fiscal retention obligation. We save the data in our customer system for three to six years, so that we can answer claims within the applicable time limit.
When you create an account with Transavia, we save these details for as long as your account is active. Even if you have not created an account, we save your data longer when you have given permission for that or when we have a legitimate interest to do so. Of course, you can always exercise one of your rights as stated in section 8 of this privacy policy.
7. International transfer of your data
7.1
Transavia may transfer your personal data to countries other than your country of residence (including countries outside the European Economic Area). This is done to handle your booking or arrange your trip, or because our group companies, partners, or service providers provide their services from other countries. You can find the destinations we fly to on our website. The laws of the countries to which we transfer your personal data may not always offer the same level of personal data protection.
7.2
If you fly to a destination in a country other than your country of residence, transferring your personal data to that country is often necessary to provide our services to you. If this seems necessary, Transavia will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to comply with the requirements for the international transfer of personal data under applicable privacy laws. For transfers of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area, Transavia may use European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses as safeguards.
7.3
We may be obliged to provide your personal data to governmental agencies in the countries of your itinerary (see 5.4 above).
8. Your rights
8.1
You can contact our Privacy Office (see 8.4 below) to exercise your rights under applicable data protection laws, including (1) the right to access your data, (2) the right to rectify your data, (3) the right to erasure, (4) the right to restrict the processing of your data, (5) the right to data portability and (6) the right to object to processing.
1. Right of access
You can ask us whether we collect or use any of your personal data and, if so, you have the right to access that data in the form of a copy. To submit a request for access to your personal data, please use our
online form
.
2. Right to rectification and completion
You have the right to have your data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. On request, we will correct inaccurate personal data about you and, considering the purposes of the processing, supplement incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a supplementary statement.
3. Right to (data) erasure
You have the right to have your personal data deleted. This means that we will delete your data. Erasure of your personal data only takes place in certain cases, as prescribed by law and listed in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes situations where your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally processed and situations where your data has been unlawfully processed. To submit a request for the deletion of your personal data, please use our
online form
.
4. Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. This means that we will suspend the processing of your data for a certain period. Circumstances which may give rise to this right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data is being contested and we need time to verify its accuracy or inaccuracy. This right does not prevent us from continuing to store your personal data. We will inform you before the restriction is lifted.
5. Right to data portability
Your right to data portability means that you can request us to provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have such data transferred directly to another data controller, insofar as technically feasible. On request and to the extent this is technically feasible, we will transfer your personal data directly to the other controller.
6. Right to object
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data. This means that you can ask us to stop processing your personal data. This only applies if the ground of ‘legitimate interests’ (including profiling) constitutes the legal basis for processing (see 4.3 ‘Legal basis’ above).
You may object, at any time and free of charge, to direct marketing if your personal data is processed for such purposes, including profiling if it relates to direct marketing. If you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data for such purposes.
8.2 Withdrawal of consent
You may withdraw your consent at any time by following the specific instructions related to the processing for which you have your consent. For example, you can withdraw your consent by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email, changing your communication preferences in your account (if available) or changing your smartphone settings (for mobile push notifications and location data).
You can also contact the Transavia Privacy Office. For more information on how to withdraw your consent to cookies and similar technologies that we use when you visit our websites or use mobile apps, please check our
cookie policy
.
8.3 Denial or restriction of rights
There may be situations in which we are entitled to deny or limit your rights as described in 8.1 above. In all cases, we will carefully consider whether such an exemption applies and inform you accordingly.
For example, we may deny your request for access if it is necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other people or refuse to erase your personal data if the processing of such data is necessary to comply with legal obligations. The right to data portability, for example, does not apply if the personal data has not been provided by you or if we process the data on grounds other than your consent or for the performance of a contract.

We may also record your specific medical needs and any additional assistance you require. If biometric boarding is applicable, we usually receive a confirmation from the external party that facilitates biometric boarding (such as facial recognition) that your identity has been verified. Unless indicated otherwise, we do not receive any identifiers about you (such as facial images) other than the personal data we already have at our disposal (such as passport details). For more information on the collection and use of your personal data in the context of biometric boarding, please check the privacy policy of the organisation that facilitates the biometric boarding.
We may also be statutorily required to carry out health checks or collect your health data for public health purposes prior to boarding or disembarking.

We may also record telephone calls for training purposes or to prevent or combat fraud. We register your communication preferences. For example, when you subscribe to one of our newsletters or when you choose to receive your booking-related communication (such as confirmation, check-in notification, boarding pass and flight status updates) through channels other than email (such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger).
h. Information we collect when you use our websites, mobile apps or other digital services
• When you visit our websites, use our mobile apps or any other digital service, we may register your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring website, web browsing behaviour and app use.

k. Passengers who are unruly or misuse our services
Transavia keeps a list of passengers who have been unruly before or after the flight, or on board one of our aircraft. Unruly behaviour may include obstructing safety, disturbing public order, inflicting injury to our ground crew, crew or fellow passengers or causing damage to our property. For this list, we process the names of the passengers, their gender, date of birth, email address, flight details, a brief factual description of the incident and the severity of the unruly behaviour, the type and duration of the measures taken and, if applicable, a copy of the official report. Transavia Airlines C.V. may share a limited amount of this data (first and last name, date of birth and the duration of the imposed safety measure) with KLM (see also section 1 above). We also keep a list of passengers who misuse our services. For this purpose, we process the names, dates of birth and booking numbers of the passengers and a brief description of the incident and the severity of the misuse. For more information, see sections 3(e) and 4.1(f) below).
2.2 Special categories of personal data
Some categories of personal data, such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, health-related data, and personal data relating to criminal law matters, are subject to stricter rules under the applicable privacy laws.
We may need to collect and use these categories of personal data, for example to provide you with assistance or facilities appropriate to your medical needs during your trip, to accommodate your requests, to ensure flight safety or to comply with statutory requirements. Biometric data is also subject to stricter rules. However, explained under 2.1(d), we do not normally collect or use your biometric data.
2.3 Children younger than 16 years

b. Personal data received from your travel agent, our airline partners and other companies involved in facilitating your trips
We receive your data from these parties to handle your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases. For example, when you book a flight through a travel agent or an online platform, we receive your identifying data and booking data from those third parties.
c. When you use our website or mobile apps, we collect information using cookies and similar technologies
Transavia uses its own cookies and third-party cookies. You can find more information in our cookie policy.
d. If you use social networks, we may also receive information from your social network provider
For more information, see 2.1(i). above.
e. If you have been unruly, we will collect certain information for flight safety purposes
If you have been unruly before or during a flight, we will make a report. In addition to the data provided to us in the context of your booking or reservation (e.g. name and date of birth), this report may also include information provided by people involved in the incident and/or responsible for handling it (see also sections 2.1(k) above and 4.1(f) below).
4. Purposes for which we use your data
4.1. Main purposes for which we use your personal data:
a. To provide our services to you
We use the information described under 2.1(a) through (k) to handle your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases. For example, we use your name, email address and other identifying information to issue your ticket. We use your contact details to inform you of changes to your flight status.
We need to know your specific medical needs to ensure you receive appropriate care. We only use this data to ensure that you receive appropriate medical care.
b. To provide you with our online services and mobile apps
•
For example, we use your name and flight details when you use our app to check in for your flight.
•
Some of our online services and apps use your location, for example to show you the nearest location of interest.
•
To provide you with the best possible digital experience, we analyse your use of digital media so that we can tailor our communication to the digital channel or device you use (see 2.1(h)).
•
If you break off your booking session on our website, we will send you an email with a link to your booking session so that you can continue where you left off. You may receive similar emails if you break off booking sessions on the websites of our partner Airtrade, which offer package deals. We will only send you such emails if you have subscribed to our newsletter or agreed to receive updates and special offers from us by email (see 4.1(d)). You can withdraw your consent to such emails at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email, changing your communication preferences in your account (if available), or by contacting us (see 8 ‘Your Rights’ below).
c. For statistical research
•
General: We examine general trends in the use of our services, websites, mobile apps, social media, as well as trends in the behaviour and preferences of our customers and users. We use our research results to develop better services and offers for our customers, provide better customer service and improve the design and content of our websites and mobile apps.
•
Categories of data: To conduct our research, we may use the categories of personal data described in 2.1(a) through (j). We only use ‘aggregated data’ or ‘pseudonymised data’ for our research. This is data that cannot be traced back to you directly because all directly identifiable elements (e.g. names and email addresses) have been removed or encoded and given a number. We take appropriate measures to ensure that only a limited group of employees has access to the data.
•
Example: If our research on booking details and data about additional services (seats, luggage) shows that passengers to certain destinations are more inclined to purchase luggage, we may use that information to offer luggage more prominently for those destinations. We also use customer surveys to measure customer satisfaction and to understand what is important to our customers. We combine data from our customer surveys with details about your booking to analyse, for example, whether certain preferences occur frequently with bookings of a similar size.
•
The legal basis and the right to object: We collect and use your personal data for our legitimate interests described above (see ‘General’). You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for statistical purposes under grounds related to your specific circumstances (see below, 8 ‘Your rights’).
d. Marketing purposes
i. General: We may use your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This section explains how we use your data for these purposes.
ii. Channels: We use various channels such as email, mobile push notifications, advertising space on websites and social media channels. For example:
• Display relevant information and personalised advertisements on websites, apps and via social media platforms: we may add the information we collect through cookies and similar technologies (for more information, see 2.1 (h) above) to other information we already have about you. For example, regarding your current or past booking/bookings, to personalise our websites and apps and make them more relevant for you, and to show you personalised advertisements and offers on the social media platforms you use, by means of audience targeting. We may also use your personal data to exclude you from advertisements that are no longer relevant to you.
We use Census services to manage the collected data and create segments of user visitors based on target groups. To determine our target audiences for specific campaigns, we may use data we collect during your interactions with our websites, mobile apps or other digital media.
We can then synchronise these segments in real-time with various (social media) platforms such as Google, Meta, DeployTeq, Pega, Xandr and TikTok. In order to enable these platforms to determine whether you have an account, we can share certain data, such as a pseudonymised (hashed) email address. With Census, we can also recognise you on the various (social media) platforms you use based on this information. This helps us to determine more precisely which target groups are relevant for specific campaigns. Please consult the privacy policies of these social media platforms for more information.
• Custom audience targeting through Meta: you can choose to receive personalised advertisements and offers on the social media platforms you use.
For example, we use the Facebook Custom Audience programme. Among other things, this programme enables us to display personalised advertisements and offers in your newsfeed on Meta platforms, including Facebook Messenger and Instagram. We can also use this programme to exclude you from advertising campaigns on Meta platforms, if for example you have already received similar advertisements or offers by email.
To enable Meta to determine whether you have a Meta account, we share your pseudonymised (hashed) email address with Meta. We do not share any other data with Meta. In turn, Meta only provides us with aggregated data on the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. This is data that cannot be traced directly back to you. In this way, we do our utmost to keep your personal data secure and confidential.
To determine our target group for a specific Meta campaign, we may use your booking details or the data we collect when you use our websites, mobile apps or other digital media. In addition, Meta may use the personal data it collects about you to compile a similar target group. This allows us to reach a new target group through Meta.
Read more about how Meta uses your data for its custom audience programme and how you can control how Meta uses information about you to personalise the advertisements that you see. You can also check Meta’s privacy policy.
If you no longer want us to include you in our social media custom audience targeting programmes, you can refuse the use of cookies through your browser settings or revoke options. For more information, please also read our
cookie policy
.
iii. Personalised offers: We aim to make advertisements and offers as relevant as possible for you. For this reason, we may analyse the categories of personal data described in point 2.1, under (a) through (j) and point 4.1 under c). We use the results of this analysis to personalise advertisements and offers. For example, after you have returned from a trip we may send you an email with offers based on your booking history, to give you inspiration for your next trip. We may also use your booking history (e.g. destination, travel period) to make you personalised offers and to tailor our website and the booking process on our website to you.
iv. Legal basis and right to object: Unless indicated otherwise, we collect and use your personal data as described in this section 4.1(d) for our legitimate interests and those of third parties. You have the right to object at any time to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including related profiling activities (see 8 ‘Your rights’ below).
•
Opt-in and opt-out, unsubscribe and right to object. We only send you emails with updates and special offers if you not opt-out during the booking process. You can unsubscribe from these emails with updates and special offers at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email, by changing your communication preferences in your account (if available) or by contacting us (see 8 'Your rights' below). When you unsubscribe, you will still receive our booking related service emails (such as your booking confirmation, boarding pass and welcome email). If you have opted to receive personalised advertisements and offers through mobile push notifications, you can unsubscribe by changing your smartphone settings (for mobile push notifications). Visit the website of your social network provider for more information on how to unsubscribe from receiving personalised advertisements and offers through social channels. You may object at any time to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (see below ‘Your rights’).

Marketing cookies. Our websites use marketing cookies which are typically placed by advertising networks. These networks are companies that act as intermediaries between Transavia and advertisers. These marketing cookies are used, among other things, to show you relevant, personalised advertisements or offers (based on your visit and click behaviour on our websites) when you visit those networks or connected websites. For more information about these marketing cookies and how to withdraw your consent for these cookies, please see our

Linked site behaviour. When you log in to our website using your My Transavia account or if you visit our websites via a link in an email, we link your site behaviour to your booking data on our data management platform. We mainly use this data to exclude you from further advertising once you have booked a flight. For example, when you search for a flight on our main website, marketing cookies will be used to show you relevant advertisements (see previous section). When you book a flight through one of our other websites or with one of our group companies, we will stop showing you advertisements through marketing cookies based on your search behaviour on our main website.
e. To communicate with you
•
We use your contact details to communicate with you in relation to our services or loyalty programmes, to answer your questions or to handle your complaints.
f. To ensure flight safety and prevent misuse
•
Transavia keeps a list of passengers who have been unruly or misused our services (see also section 2.1(k) and 3(e) above). Depending on the severity of the conduct, we can either (1) only allow these passengers on board under certain conditions for a period of three years, or (2) Transavia Airlines C.V. refuse passengers on flights for five years. In case of aggravating circumstances (such as repeated misconduct) Transavia Airlines C.V. can in specific cases decide to refuse a passenger on flights for more than five years. In very serious cases, Transavia Airlines C.V. can even decide to refuse a passenger for life. Special information regarding children: Children under the age of 15 who have been unruly will not be placed on the list by Transavia. For children aged 15 to 16, Transavia can decide that for a maximum period of one year, they are only allowed on board under certain conditions. Passengers on the lists will be personally informed (by email if possible) of the fact that they have been placed on the list and why, what security measures have been taken against them, how long these apply to them and where they can lodge a complaint or object to the inclusion. For more information on how to view or amend this data, see section 8 ‘Your rights’ below.
g. To conduct our business operations or to comply with legal obligations
•
We collect, use, and retain your personal data to perform our business activities, such as for administrative purposes, to prevent or combat fraud or to settle disputes. In the event of fraud or misuse of our services, we may include your personal data in our internal fraud control and warning systems. As a result of this, your bookings may be subject to careful scrutiny and may be rejected or cancelled in certain cases, or you may no longer be welcome on board our aircraft or only under certain conditions (see 4.1f) above). We also collect and use your personal data to comply with our legal and tax obligations.
4.2 Specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns
For specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns, we may use your personal data for purposes other than those described in this privacy policy. We will inform you about those purposes when you register for the service, event, contest, or campaign, or when you download the relevant app.
4.3 Legal basis
We may only collect and use your personal data if we have a legal basis for doing so. In many cases, we need your personal data to receive your booking, arrange your flight or purchases, or answer your questions (see 4.1(a), (b) and (e) above). In these cases, the legal basis for processing your data is ‘necessary for the performance of a contract’.
If you have consented to the collection and use of your personal data (you can withdraw this consent at any time, see section 8 ‘Your rights’ below), we will collect and use your data based on that consent.
In certain cases, we may use your personal details when we or a third party have a legitimate interest in doing so. We always carefully consider all interests: your interests, those of others and those of Transavia. On that legal basis, we will collect and use your data for, for example, flight safety purposes, statistical research, direct marketing purposes or to provide you with personalised offers (see 4.1(b), (c), (d) and (f) above for more information).
We may also have a legal obligation to use your data, for example to meet immigration formalities (see 4.1, under g), above).
If you refuse to provide the personal data we need to fulfil the contract we have concluded with you or to comply with a legal obligation, we may not be able to provide all the services you have requested from us. Consequently, we may have to cancel your flight, or we may not be able to provide you with the additional services you have requested. If you provide incomplete or inaccurate information, we may be forced to deny you boarding or entry into a foreign territory.
5. Granting access to or sharing data with third parties
5.1 General
We may share your personal data with third parties in the following cases.
a. To facilitate your bookings and trips
To process your reservations and bookings and to arrange your trips and purchases, we often need to share your personal data with our group companies, partner airlines, airport operators and other companies involved in facilitating your trip (see 3.1(b) above, ‘How we collect your data’).
b. For support or additional services
To provide our services, we use the support or additional services of third parties, such as IT suppliers, social media providers, marketing agencies and screening service providers. All these third parties are obliged to adequately secure your personal data and only use this data in accordance with our instructions.
Transavia and Transavia France conduct their business activities using centralised databases and systems. These centralised databases and systems may be hosted by one of the two parties or managed for the other. In addition, for efficiency purposes, certain operational functions may be performed by one party for the other. That means that Transavia and Transavia France could have access to your personal data for these purposes. Transavia and Transavia France may only use your personal data to the extent required for the relevant business function and according to this privacy policy.
c. For the Flying Blue programme
If you choose to 'earn' and/or 'spend' miles on Transavia products, we share your personal data with Flying Blue. For more information on how KLM and Air France handle your personal data in this regard, please check their privacy policies.
d. Payment services
To process payments for your trips and purchases, we may work with third-party payment service providers. In many cases, these payment service providers also perform fraud checks. These providers have their own privacy policies regarding the way they use your personal data.
e. Personalised marketing via social media platforms
For more information, see 4.1(d) under ‘Purposes for which we use your data’.
f. To allow our partners to tailor their services to your trip
We may share your non-personal data (destination, date of travel and duration of the trip) with partners offering additional services (e.g. hotel accommodation, car rental services) so that they can send you offers tailored to your trip. Our partners have their own privacy policies regarding the way they use your personal data.
5.2 Specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns
For specific services, apps, events, contests, or campaigns, we may share your data with third parties other than those described in this privacy policy, for example, when we organise a campaign or an event in collaboration with a partner or when we integrate their services into our apps. We will inform you about this when you register for the service, event, contest, or campaign, or when you download the app.
5.3 Exchanging your details with KLM
Airlines have an obligation to ensure flight safety. To this end, Transavia implements certain (necessary) safety measures. For example, Transavia keeps a record of passengers who have been unruly on the ground or on board (see section 2.1(k), 3(e) and 4.1(f) above). Based on this list we may (1) only allow said passengers on board under certain conditions for a period of three years, or (2) refuse them on board for a certain period. KLM, a group company of Transavia, keeps a similar list. To increase the scope of the internal safety measures taken, Transavia Airlines C.V. and KLM exchange the personal data of passengers who have been denied boarding for a certain period of time (see section 1 above). A person denied boarding by Transavia Airlines C.V. is now also denied boarding on KLM flights (and vice versa). If you have been unruly and this has led to your inclusion on the list, you will be informed personally by the airline where the disturbance occurred.
5.4. Government agencies
(A) General
We may be legally required to collect your personal data before you travel to another country and share it with the government agencies in the countries on your itinerary. For example, we may be legally required to collect and share your identifying data and your booking and travel information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of border control, immigration formalities, entering a country or combatting terrorism or other serious crimes (see 5.4(B) below). We may also be legally required to share your health data with the government agencies in the countries on your itinerary for public health purposes (see 2.1(d) above).
(B) PNR and API data
i. General: Under European and national regulations (including Dutch regulations implementing the PNR Directive (EU2016/281) and the API Directive (EU2004/82)) and international treaties, Transavia must provide so-called PNR and API data to authorised government agencies, such as Passenger Information Units (PIUs). PNR (Passenger Name Record) concerns all information about your bookings, such as flight information, passengers in the booking and payment information. PNR data are used by government agencies for law enforcement purposes, including combating illegal trade and terrorism. API (Advance Passenger Information) concerns information about your flight and passport details. API details are mainly used by government agencies to reduce illegal immigration through improved border control. Transavia France provides these PNR details, for example, to the French PIU in the case of flights to and from France (excluding domestic flights). In the case of flights by Transavia Netherlands, these PNR details are provided to the Dutch PIU (Pi-NL) for flights to and from the Netherlands. Where required by the law of the country of destination, we may also provide your API and PNR details to authorities in countries other than France and the Netherlands. In your booking, we will indicate when we are obliged to do so.
ii. Specific conditions per country:
- France: Pursuant to Article L 237 -7 of the French Homeland Security Code, we may be required to provide your reservation, checking and boarding data (API/PNR) to the French national government agencies and competent authorities for the purposes of and subject to conditions defined in Decree No. 2014-1095 of 26 September 2014, as amended by Decree No. 2018/714 of 3 August 2018.
5.5. Third party websites
Our websites and mobile apps contain links to third-party websites. If you follow these links, you leave our websites or mobile apps. This privacy policy does not apply to the third-party websites. For more information on how third parties handle your personal data, please check their privacy and/or cookie policies (if available).
6. Security and retention
6.1 Security
Transavia will take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against loss or unlawful use.
How to protect yourself?
Everyone plays an important role in protecting the security and confidentiality of personal data. If you make a booking, you will be sent file references. These booking references must remain confidential at all times. Disclosing them to other passengers may allow them to access your booking details through our systems or those of third parties involved in the providing your trip (e.g. travel agencies or online search and booking sites). If you are travelling with others and do not want your personal details disclosed to them, we recommend making separate reservations.
We also recommend that you do not disclose the passwords you use to access our services to third parties, that you systematically log out of your profile and social account (especially in the case of linked accounts) and that you close the browser window at the end of your session, especially if you are using the internet on a public computer. This prevents other users from accessing your personal data. To avoid the risk of hacking, we recommend using different passwords for each online service you use. We cannot be held liable for the theft of your data on a platform that is not managed by us.
In addition, we strongly recommend that you not to provide to third parties any documents issued by Transavia containing your personal data (your boarding card, ticket number, etc.) or any other information related to your trip or to publish them on social networks. If you decide to publish these documents on social media, you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions of use, information security practices and privacy policies applicable to those third-party social networks. We cannot be held liable for how data is processed, stored or disclosed on these platforms.
6.2 Retention
Your personal data will be retained for as long as is required for the purposes described in this privacy policy or to the extent necessary to comply with legal obligations and for the resolution of any disputes. In principle, we save booking and payment details in our booking and payment systems for four to seven years. We do so to fulfil our fiscal retention obligation. We save the data in our customer system for three to six years, so that we can answer claims within the applicable time limit.
When you create an account with Transavia, we save these details for as long as your account is active. Even if you have not created an account, we save your data longer when you have given permission for that or when we have a legitimate interest to do so. Of course, you can always exercise one of your rights as stated in section 8 of this privacy policy.
7. International transfer of your data
7.1
Transavia may transfer your personal data to countries other than your country of residence (including countries outside the European Economic Area). This is done to handle your booking or arrange your trip, or because our group companies, partners, or service providers provide their services from other countries. You can find the destinations we fly to on our website. The laws of the countries to which we transfer your personal data may not always offer the same level of personal data protection.
7.2
If you fly to a destination in a country other than your country of residence, transferring your personal data to that country is often necessary to provide our services to you. If this seems necessary, Transavia will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to comply with the requirements for the international transfer of personal data under applicable privacy laws. For transfers of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area, Transavia may use European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses as safeguards.
7.3
We may be obliged to provide your personal data to governmental agencies in the countries of your itinerary (see 5.4 above).
8. Your rights
8.1
You can contact our Privacy Office (see 8.4 below) to exercise your rights under applicable data protection laws, including (1) the right to access your data, (2) the right to rectify your data, (3) the right to erasure, (4) the right to restrict the processing of your data, (5) the right to data portability and (6) the right to object to processing.
1. Right of access
You can ask us whether we collect or use any of your personal data and, if so, you have the right to access that data in the form of a copy. To submit a request for access to your personal data, please use our
online form
.
2. Right to rectification and completion
You have the right to have your data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. On request, we will correct inaccurate personal data about you and, considering the purposes of the processing, supplement incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a supplementary statement.
3. Right to (data) erasure
You have the right to have your personal data deleted. This means that we will delete your data. Erasure of your personal data only takes place in certain cases, as prescribed by law and listed in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes situations where your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally processed and situations where your data has been unlawfully processed. To submit a request for the deletion of your personal data, please use our
online form
.
4. Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. This means that we will suspend the processing of your data for a certain period. Circumstances which may give rise to this right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data is being contested and we need time to verify its accuracy or inaccuracy. This right does not prevent us from continuing to store your personal data. We will inform you before the restriction is lifted.
5. Right to data portability
Your right to data portability means that you can request us to provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have such data transferred directly to another data controller, insofar as technically feasible. On request and to the extent this is technically feasible, we will transfer your personal data directly to the other controller.
6. Right to object
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data. This means that you can ask us to stop processing your personal data. This only applies if the ground of ‘legitimate interests’ (including profiling) constitutes the legal basis for processing (see 4.3 ‘Legal basis’ above).
You may object, at any time and free of charge, to direct marketing if your personal data is processed for such purposes, including profiling if it relates to direct marketing. If you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data for such purposes.
8.2 Withdrawal of consent
You may withdraw your consent at any time by following the specific instructions related to the processing for which you have your consent. For example, you can withdraw your consent by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email, changing your communication preferences in your account (if available) or changing your smartphone settings (for mobile push notifications and location data).
You can also contact the Transavia Privacy Office. For more information on how to withdraw your consent to cookies and similar technologies that we use when you visit our websites or use mobile apps, please check our
cookie policy
.
8.3 Denial or restriction of rights
There may be situations in which we are entitled to deny or limit your rights as described in 8.1 above. In all cases, we will carefully consider whether such an exemption applies and inform you accordingly.
For example, we may deny your request for access if it is necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other people or refuse to erase your personal data if the processing of such data is necessary to comply with legal obligations. The right to data portability, for example, does not apply if the personal data has not been provided by you or if we process the data on grounds other than your consent or for the performance of a contract.
