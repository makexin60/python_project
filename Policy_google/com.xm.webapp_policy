Such entities operate their own websites and as such, if you are interested in learning about how such entities process your personal data, please refer to their corresponding privacy statements which may be found on their specific websites.
The Company respects the privacy of any user who accesses its website(s), and it is therefore committed to taking all reasonable steps to safeguard any existing or prospective clients, applicants and website visitors.
The Company keeps any clients’/potential clients’ personal data in accordance with the applicable data protection laws and regulations.
We have the necessary and appropriate technical and organisational measures and procedures in place to ensure that your information remains secure at all times.

Such obligations and requirements impose on us necessary personal data processing activities for credit checks, identity verification, payment processing, compliance with court orders, tax law or other reporting obligations and anti-money laundering controls.
These obligations apply at various times, including client on boarding/acceptance, payments and systemic checks for risk management.
3. For the purposes of safeguarding legitimate interests
We process personal data so as to safeguard the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information.

initiating legal claims and preparing our defense in litigation procedures;
means and processes we undertake to provide for the Company’s IT and system security, preventing potential crime, asset security, admittance controls and anti-trespassing measures;
