By choosing to use our AI Wallpaper App, you consent to the collection and utilization of information as described in this policy. The Personal Information we collect is solely used for improving and delivering the AI Wallpaper App, managing in-app purchases, and delivering Firebase integration services. We assure you that we will not share or utilize your information for any purposes other than those explicitly stated in this Privacy Policy.
The terminology used in this Privacy Policy holds the same definitions as outlined in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the AI Wallpaper App unless explicitly specified otherwise.

We collect and store this information securely for the purpose of processing payments, providing premium memberships, and delivering subscription services.
In-App Purchases

These purchases are processed securely through authorized app stores (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store) and are subject to the respective app store's terms and policies. We do not have access to your payment information, as it is handled directly by the app store's payment processing system.

Whenever you use our AI Wallpaper App, in the event of an app error or to improve our services, we may collect data and information, including Log Data, through third-party products on your device. This Log Data may include your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the app's configuration during use, timestamps of your interactions with the AI Wallpaper App, and other statistical data.
Cookies
Our AI Wallpaper App may incorporate third-party code and libraries that employ cookies to gather information and enhance their respective services, including Firebase services. You have the option to accept or decline these cookies, and your device can notify you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose to decline our cookies, certain portions of the AI Wallpaper App may be inaccessible.
Service Providers
In order to deliver and improve our AI Wallpaper App, we may engage the services of third-party companies and individuals for various reasons, including facilitating the App, providing the App on our behalf, performing App-related tasks, or assisting us in analyzing the usage of our AI Wallpaper App.
It is important to note that these third parties may have access to your Personal Information for the sole purpose of fulfilling their assigned tasks on our behalf. However, they are strictly obligated not to disclose or utilize your information for any other purposes.
Security
At ArrowWalls, we highly value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information. As such, we employ commercially acceptable measures to protect it. However, it is important to acknowledge that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure and reliable. Therefore, while we strive to use the most secure means possible, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

Our AI Wallpaper App may contain links to external websites. Please be aware that these sites are operated independently and are beyond our control. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policies of these websites, as we assume no responsibility for their content, privacy policies, or practices.
