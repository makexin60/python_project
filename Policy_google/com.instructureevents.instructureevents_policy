Bizzabo Privacy and Cookie Policy
Last Updated: November 11, 2024
1. Introduction.
Summary: Bizzabo processes personal data. Bizzabo is generally a data processor on behalf of its customers, event organizers. In some cases, Bizzabo is a controller for its own business purposes.
This Privacy Policy applies to data that we, Bizzabo, Inc. and our affiliates (“
Bizzabo
,” “we,” “our”, or “us”) may collect about You in connection with: (A) Your access to, and use of: (i) Bizzabo’s website located at www.bizzabo.com (the “
Website
”), (ii) Bizzabo’s cloud-based event success, management and registration platform (the “
Platform
”), (iii) our social media pages, (iv) mobile app (the “
App
”), and (v) any other products and services offered by Bizzabo (collectively, “
Services
”), (B) email or other communications with You (for example, customer support requests, marketing activities, and surveys) in which You may provide personal data to Bizzabo; (C) Your application for employment with us; (D) Data we process in accordance with our obligations as Your employer.
In this Privacy Policy, the Website, the Platform, the App, social media pages, emails, and other electronic locations, through which You may interact with Bizzabo to provide Your data, are collectively referred to as the “
Sites
.”
In this policy “
You
” refers to any individual who accesses and uses the Sites and/or Services, applies for a job, or is employed by us. For example, You may be a customer or representative of a customer of Bizzabo who accesses and uses the Sites and Services as the host or organizer of an event (“
Customer
”), and with whom Bizzabo has entered into a Master Services Agreement or other agreement containing separate terms and conditions that govern delivery, access and use of the Sites and Services (either, a “
Customer Agreement
”). You may be the employee or agent of a Customer, who is authorized to access the Platform as an administrator or to interact with Bizzabo on behalf of a Customer. Or, You may be a visitor to our Website who is just interested in browsing and learning more about Bizzabo.
If You apply for employment with us, You may be required to send personal data, such as Your Curriculum Vitae, recommendations, evaluations, and supporting documentation, to our HR team directly or through a third party vendor. We are a “controller” of such data.
When we collect data from You, we may be doing so on our own behalf (in which case we will be considered a “Controller” of Your data), or on behalf of a Customer who is using the Services to organize an Event and manage other Event-related activities (in which case, the Customer will be the “Controller” and Bizzabo will be considered a “Processor” of Your data). In general, and unless we are the event organizer, when collecting or otherwise processing data from Event Attendees, Bizzabo will do so as a processor on behalf of the respective Customer who is the controller of such data. In such a case, some aspects of this Privacy Policy may not apply to You. We encourage You to review Your Controller’s privacy policy, and reach out to the Controller directly with any inquiry or concern.
If You are invited to, register for, check into, or receive data regarding a Customer event (“
Event
”) through Bizzabo Sites or Service, You will be considered an “
Event Attendee
” and we will provide any Personal Data You submit through the Sites or Service to the Customer organizing that Event. Bizzabo does not control its Customer’s Event registration or management process, or the Personal Data that a Customer requests from Event Attendees. We are not responsible for any decisions or actions taken by the Customer with respect to Your data (or by any third party with whom the Customer may share Your data). Please read the applicable privacy policies of the Customer who is organizing the Event before submitting Personal Data in connection with their Event.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party applications or software that integrates with the Services through the Sites, or any other third party products, services, or websites (together “Third Party Services”) through our App Market or otherwise. Third Party Services are governed by the terms of such third parties even if You initially engaged with such third party through our Sites.
If You do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the Sites or Services.
2. Information we collect.
Summary: we collect various categories of personal and non-personal data in order to enable our Services. Data may be provided by You or by a third party when authorized to do so.
Personal Data
“
Personal Data
” is any information collected on or through our Sites and/or Services or provided by You that may be used to identify or personally contact You or another individual, or that relates to an identifiable natural person. Personal Data (sometimes called Personally Identifiable Information, or Personal Data) may include, but is not limited to, name, job title, company name, email address, mailing address, phone number, browser and device information (including IP Address), and other identifying information You may provide to Bizzabo.
You are not required to provide Bizzabo with any Personal Data. However, certain Services and Sites’ functionalities may not be available to You unless some Personal Data is provided by You, or by a Customer or Customer administrator on Your behalf. If You are submitting Personal Data relating to any other person (including as a Customer administrator, or on behalf of other individuals at Your company), You represent that You have a legal basis to collect this data and to provide this data to Bizzabo, and to permit us to use it in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
If You apply for employment, we will collect information regarding Your education and employment history. We process additional categories of personal data of our employees as required by applicable law, including but not limited to tax ID, insurance ID, bank account details, any requirements related to health and safety, as well as additional data that may be necessary for effective employment, such as performance reviews and evaluations, communications, and training.
Non-Personal Data
Non-Personal Data includes any information that is anonymized, aggregated or otherwise presented in a way that does not allow identification of a specific individual, or is not directly associated with a unique person.
3. How we collect information.
Summary: We collect information from the various ways that You interact with us on-line and off-line. This includes online trackers and cookies which monitor online behaviors, and other sources detailed here.
From our Website
If You visit our Sites and request a free demo, register for a webinar, subscribe to our blog, ask for Service information or download content, or otherwise contact us, You will be asked to provide certain Personal Data, including Your contact details.
We will use this Personal Data for purposes that will be clear from the context: such as answering questions regarding our Service offerings, providing support, registering You for a demo, initiating a sales dialogue, targeted marketing and advertising, personalizing services, enabling account management, fraud prevention,
etc
.
From our Platform
Except for data pertaining to Customer’s administrators, information collected via the Platform (including the App) is collected from or on behalf of our Customers who host or manage Events. This information is either collected from Customer administrators who access the back-end of our Platform or other tools used by Customers, or from Event Attendees directly, including through their use of the Platform and of the Services.
This type of Personal Data is controlled by the Customer, and Bizzabo collects and processes it at the Customer’s direction, and in accordance with instructions provided by the Customer, including the applicable terms in any Customer Agreement. With respect to this type of information, Bizzabo is a processor, and Customer is the controller. Bizzabo works together with Customers and offers tools so that Customers can provide appropriate notice regarding the purposes for which they are collecting Personal Data on our Platform, and so that Customers can also obtain consent to the collection and use of such information, where appropriate, or secure alternate lawful bases for the processing. Such notices, consent and lawful bases are entirely the responsibility of the Customer.
Personal Data may also be collected through the Platform by Bizzabo for events run by Bizzabo, in which case Bizzabo is the controller of such Personal Data.
From the App or Other Smart Devices
When You download or use the App or other smart devices in connection with a Customer Event, we collect app usage data, including which of our apps have been downloaded to Your mobile device and when.
If, where applicable, You have requested or consented to location services in connection with Your use of the App or other smart devices, we may receive information about Your location and Your mobile device. We use this information to provide You with location-based Services and other personalized content based on Your location, as part of Customers’ management of Event Attendees’ data. Most mobile devices enable You to shut off location-based services; please access Your mobile device’s “Settings” for more information. With respect to all App data in connection with an Event of which You are an actual or prospective Event Attendee, Customer is the controller.
Personal Data may also be collected through the App and other smart devices by Bizzabo for events run by Bizzabo, in which case Bizzabo is the controller of such Personal Data.
From Email messages
If You contact a Bizzabo representative using our customer service email, or any one of our informational email mailboxes (
e.g.
,
support@bizzabo.com
,
privacy@bizzabo.com
), we will store information such as the email address from which You sent the message, and use the information to reply to You.
Data provided by You
If You apply for employment, You will need to provide us with information about Yourself to enable us to access Your credentials. If we decide to employ You, we will also process additional personal data as required by applicable law. Such information may be collected directly by us or on our behalf by third parties.
From Offline Interactions
We may request and collect Your Personal Data offline – for example, when You attend a Bizzabo promotional event or if You connect with one of our sales representatives for Data about our product offerings, or when we invite You to the interview or employ You. Likewise, we collect Personal Data of our vendors and partners or their representatives and staff in connection with our contracts with them.
From Surveys
We may ask You to participate in a survey, and Your responses could contain Personal Data.
In connection with Your use of the Sites and/or Services, we may also request occasional information about Your interests and preferences, to better provide communications, offers and content that are specifically tailored to Your personal interests.

Information Collected Automatically
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically when You visit our Sites, such as Your computer type (MAC or Windows), mobile device type, language, internet browser, any web pages that referred You to our Sites, and Your Internet Protocol (IP) Address (which may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever You visit the Website or Platform). We may also store general usage and activity data, such as the date and duration of Your visit, and Your navigation of the Sites. We use this information for reasons such as improving Sites performance, analytics, and functionality, and monitoring the regions from which users access our Website or Platform, in order to help us enhance the user experience and Sites security.
Information from Cookies and other Tracking Technologies
Bizzabo’s Sites may use tracking technologies involving identification and local storage. These technologies are used in order to provide, maintain and improve the Sites, to optimize our offerings and marketing activities (including through targeted advertising) and to provide You with a better user experience. This includes tracking technologies of third-party social media, analytics and advertising partners. For more information, see the ‘Cookies and other Tracking Technologies’ Section below.

Our HR team also obtains information from CV databases, recruiting agencies and social media for recruiting purposes.
4. What is Bizzabo’s legal basis, as a controller for collecting and processing your personal data.
Summary: Data is collected on the basis of our contractual obligations, Your consent, for legal requirements, and also to meet various legitimate interests, such as improving products and services and fraud prevention.
Bizzabo’s legal basis for collecting and using the types of Personal Data described above will depend on the nature of the Personal Data collected, and the context in which we are collecting it. When we collect, use, process or disclose Your Personal Data, we rely on one or more of the following legal grounds:

We rely on legitimate interest in evaluating employment candidates. We rely on our legitimate interests when they are not overridden by Your fundamental rights and freedoms.

If You submit information to any of those sites, Your information is governed by their privacy policies, which may differ from those of Bizzabo. Bizzabo is not, and will not be, responsible for the privacy practices or security of any such websites.

We remain liable under the DPF Principles (see section 15 below) in cases of onward transfer to third parties if such third parties use personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
7. What do we do to secure your personal data?
Summary: we take data security very seriously, invest in security systems, and train our staff. In the event of a breach, we will provide notifications as required by law.
Bizzabo makes it a priority to safeguard the security and privacy of Your Personal Data. Bizzabo has implemented appropriate organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Your Personal Data from unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration or loss.
These measures include security controls to prevent unauthorized access to our facilities and systems, strong authentication procedures and strict password protection protocols, utilizing encryption software for all financial and other sensitive Personal Data transmitted on or through our Sites, and conducting penetration tests. We follow generally accepted standards to protect Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
In the event of any security breaches, we will make legally required disclosures, which may include providing notification via email or on our Sites, as applicable.
While we take reasonable steps to protect Your Personal Data, please be aware that no method of Internet transmission or electronic storage guarantees complete protection and there is always some risk when You share Your Personal Data online. Bizzabo therefore cannot guarantee the absolute security of Your Personal Data.

support@bizzabo.com
.

We do not currently respond or take any action with respect to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We will allow third parties, such as companies that provide us with analytics tools, to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites when a consumer uses the Services.

13. Choices and opting out (marketing).
Summary: You can opt-out of marketing communications from us.
When You choose not to provide information, this may affect Your access to certain Services or prevent You from taking advantage of certain Site features offered by Bizzabo.
You may have consented to receive certain communications marketing or advertising of the Services and other products, in accordance with Your marketing preferences. You can opt-out of receiving these marketing messages at any time by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any such message, or by contacting us at the email and/or mailing address provided in the “Contact Information” section of this Policy.
Customers may use our Services to send You emails and other electronic communications, if You are on their email subscription lists or have registered for one of their Events. Although these messages are sent using our Services, we don’t determine the content or recipients of these messages. You should contact the Customer directly, or click the “Unsubscribe” link provided in messages, if You no longer want to receive communications from that Customer.

Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) in the form issued as part of the EU Commission Decision (EU) 2021/914
. In general, Bizzabo has no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorizing access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under the SCC. Where required by EU law, an examination of that assessment is made on a case by case basis.
The previous paragraph applies, with necessary changes, for transfers of Personal Data out of the UK. Such transfers are made in compliance with UK data protection laws, including where applicable subject to standard contractual clauses in force in the UK at the time of transfer.
