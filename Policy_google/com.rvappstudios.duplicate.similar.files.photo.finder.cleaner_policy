ADVERTISING
Our apps include advertising for third-party products and services. We and our partners use your information to enhance advertising and targeting for these third-party ads within our apps. This helps ensure that the ads you see are relevant and interesting to you.
This information may includes ad identifiers and other non-personal information gathered from your device, including your age, region, and gender. Additionally, it may involve other information obtained from third parties with your consent.
Opting out of interest-based advertising:
You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier from being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier by changing your device's settings. Settings vary from device to device, but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings. You can also turn the interest-based advertising on or off from the app settings within the app's settings menu.
If you opt out, you may still see advertisements in the apps, but they will not be personalized based on your interests or information.
PROCEDURES AND METHODS TO DESTROY PERSONAL INFORMATION
When your personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws, we have established stringent procedures and methods to ensure its secure and permanent deletion. We never sell data with any third-party services.
The only personally identifiable information we collect is when someone emails us for support through the app. We remove email addresses from our support records every 90 days or once their purpose is fulfilled. We use secure deletion methods to permanently remove personal information from our systems. For any physical records or storage devices containing personal information, we ensure they are securely destroyed.
While you may contact us directly, we also encourage you to reach out to our third-party providers listed in the privacy policy if you have any questions or concerns.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
We don't knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years old (16 in Europe), unless a parent or legal guardian gives consent. If you're under 13 (16 in Europe, or under the applicable age restrictions), please don't send us any personal information or use our Services. Some of our Services may have age restrictions that vary by country, region, operating system, platform, etc.
If we become aware that a child has provided personal information without a parent's permission, we will promptly delete this information which we are handling. We also suggest that parents contact third-party services (mentioned in this policy) to delete any additional information. We encourage parents to instruct their children to never share their real names, addresses, or phone numbers online without permission.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER
We do not sell, trade, or rent users' personal identification information to others. Some of the partners and processors mentioned in this policy are located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. We advise you to contact the third-party data controller, such as an advertising partner or a payment processor, directly in accordance with their privacy policies listed
here.
It's essential to note that privacy laws vary by location. This means your data may not have the same level of protection as it does where you live.
YOUR RIGHTS AND OPTIONS

There are several ways you can control the personal data we collect about you. For example, you can delete our apps from your device or reset your device's advertising identifier.

Information about gameplay, features, and functions can be found in the app's descriptions on app stores, platforms, and our website when available.
You understand that downloading, connecting to, and playing our apps requires an Internet connection, which you are responsible for. Your Internet service provider may charge you for Internet access.

Some elements of the Services may require you to create an account. This may be necessary to download, access, or play a game.

You agree that you have no ownership or property interest in any account. If you delete your account, or if we delete your account in accordance with these terms, you may lose access to any data previously associated with your account (including, without limitation, the level or score you have reached in our games and any coins or boosters associated with your account), and no refund will be offered.
Purchases in the Services:
Our apps are free to play and contain in-app purchases and advertising. Our apps may include virtual currencies such as coins and gems ("Virtual Money") or items and services for use within our apps ("Virtual Goods"). The balance of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money has no real-world value. In-app purchases can be made with real money, and you can disable the payment feature in your device settings. Prices and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.
If you choose to sign up for subscription services, you can receive exclusive offers and numerous free extras. VIP subscriptions are available on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis and auto-renew.

Using the Services for any illegal activities, such as distributing or promoting illegal content, hacking, phishing, or engaging in fraudulent activities, is strictly forbidden. You must not cheat, use bots, exploit bugs, or engage in any unfair practices to gain an advantage in the games. Respect intellectual property rights and do not share or distribute content that you do not have the right to use. Keep your account information secure and do not share your account details with others or use someone else's account. Follow all other terms and conditions outlined in these Terms of Service and any applicable Supplemental Terms.
Data Privacy and Security:
We are committed to protecting your data and comply with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR and CCPA. We use security measures like encryption and data access controls to protect your information. However, the security of data transmitted over the Internet cannot be guaranteed.
Third-Party Services and Links:
We may link to third-party websites or services from our Services. Your use of the Services may also include applications developed or owned by a third party. Your use of such third-party applications, websites, and services is governed by that party’s own terms of service and privacy policies. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third-party application, website, or service that you visit or use. RV AppStudios does not take any responsibility for any such third parties’ content, services, or goods and does not endorse them. RV AppStudios does not take any responsibility for any losses or harm that may result from using such third parties’ content, services, or goods.
Playing Games With Other Users:
Many of our games allow you to play with or against other users. Some of our games let you search for your friends (by email address or name) so you can play together. We may also show the user names of players you have played with before to help you find them again. RV AppStudios may match you with other players based on different criteria, such as your past scores, your country, or your game level. We may also select players randomly.
By accessing or playing our games, you agree that your user name, scores, avatar, country, online/offline status, and other details may be visible to other users. You also accept that other users can find you by searching for your email address or user name. Please note that we will only show your user name publicly. Other users must already know your email address or phone number to search for you.
Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver:
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The place of arbitration shall be the USA. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the USA. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. You understand that this section means that, by using the App, you agree to arbitrate, thus waiving your rights to sue in court and have a jury trial.
Suspension and Termination:
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account, or to cease providing you with all or part of the Services, at any time and for any reason or no reason. This includes, but is not limited to: Deleting, suspending, or modifying your Account or parts thereof. Limiting, suspending, or terminating your access to the Services. Resetting or modifying any app progression, benefits, or privileges associated with you, such as levels or scores in the Games. Modifying or removing any Virtual Money or Items.

RV AppStudios, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and licensors do not warrant that the Service will function uninterrupted, secure, or available at any particular time or location. They do not guarantee that any errors or defects will be corrected, that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components, or that the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.
Limitation of Liability:
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, RV AppStudios, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.
In no event shall RV AppStudios' total liability to you for all claims arising out of or related to the Service exceed the amount you paid us, if any, for accessing and using the Service over the past twelve months.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. The limitations of liability set forth above shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.
Intellectual Property:
We put a lot of effort into creating the Service, including the logo and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information, and other content (excluding your content). This property is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.

We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms of Service at any time by posting the updated terms on our Service. We may update the Terms of Service from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.

Severability:
If any part of these Terms or any applicable Supplemental Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be interpreted in a way that makes it valid and enforceable while reflecting the original intention of the parties as closely as possible. The rest of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.
Waivers of Our Rights:
Our failure to exercise or enforce any of our rights under these Terms does not waive our right to enforce such rights. Any waiver of such rights will only be effective if it is in writing and signed by us.
