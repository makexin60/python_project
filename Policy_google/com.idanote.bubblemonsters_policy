A member who has entered into a contract with the Company for the purchase of paid content may exercise the right of withdrawal within 7 days from the later of the purchase contract date or the availability date of the content, without any additional fees or penalties.
A member may not exercise the right of withdrawal under paragraph 1 if any of the following apply:
(1) In the case of paid content that is immediately used or applied upon purchase.
(2) In the case of paid content where additional benefits have been provided and those benefits have been used.
(3) In the case of content where the act of unsealing is considered as usage or the utility of the content is determined upon unsealing.
(4) In the case of content received as a gift from others, obtained free of charge through Company events, or obtained during the process of using the service.
(5) In the case where only a part of the bundled content has been used or applied.
In cases where the Company restricts the right of withdrawal due to the reasons stated in paragraph 2, the Company shall clearly indicate such facts in a place easily accessible to members. If providing a trial version of the content is not possible or difficult, the Company shall provide information about the content to ensure that members can exercise their right of withdrawal without hindrance. If the Company fails to take such measures, members may exercise their right of withdrawal despite the restrictions under paragraph 2.
Regardless of paragraphs 1 and 2, if the content purchased by a member differs from the content displayed in advertisements or the content contract has not been fulfilled as agreed, the member may exercise the right of withdrawal within 3 months from the date the content becomes available for use or within 30 days from the date the member becomes aware of or could have become aware of the discrepancy.
When a member exercises the right of withdrawal, the Company will verify the purchase history through platform operators or open market operators. Additionally, the Company may contact the member using the information provided by the member to verify the legitimate reasons for withdrawal and may request additional evidence.
When the right of withdrawal is exercised in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4, the Company will promptly retrieve the paid content from the member and refund the payment within 3 business days. In case of delay in refunding, the Company will pay delay interest calculated at the rate prescribed in Article 21-3 of the "Act on Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce, Etc."
If a minor enters into a content purchase contract on a device, the Company will notify that the contract can be canceled by the minor or the legal representative without the consent of the legal representative. If a minor enters into a purchase contract without the consent of the legal representative, the minor or the legal representative may cancel the contract with the Company. However, this provision does not apply if the minor purchases the content with property for which the legal representative has granted permission within a specified range or if the minor deceives others into believing they are an adult or that there is consent from the legal representative.
Whether the party to the content purchase contract is a minor or not will be determined based on the device used for payment, payment executor information, payment method account holder, etc. Additionally, the Company may request the submission of documents proving that the person is a minor or legal representative to verify the legitimate cancellation.
Article 24 Refund of Overpayment
If an overpayment occurs, the Company will refund the overpaid amount to the member. However, if the overpayment is due to the member's fault without any intention or negligence on the part of the Company, the member shall bear the actual costs associated with the refund within a reasonable range.
Payments made through applications shall follow the payment method provided by the open market operator, and if an overpayment occurs during the payment process, the member must request a refund from the Company or the open market operator. However, if the open market operator's policies or system support the processing of refund procedures, the Company may act on behalf of or assist in the refund.
Refunds shall be processed according to the refund policies of each open market operator or the Company, depending on the operating system of the device being used for the service.
Fees incurred through application downloads or network services (such as call charges or data communication fees) may be excluded from the refund.
In order to process the refund of an overpayment, the Company may contact the member using the information provided by the member and may request the necessary information.
Article 25 Termination of Agreement
A member who wishes to terminate the service agreement may apply for withdrawal through the menu on the service page or request withdrawal through customer service. Upon completion of the withdrawal, all member usage information (scores, characters, items, game currency, etc.) will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. However, the Company may restrict immediate withdrawal for a certain period after the member's registration for reasons such as prevention of service abuse.
The Company may suspend the service or terminate the service agreement with prior notice for a significant reason, such as a member's violation of these Terms and Conditions, operational policies, or service policies.
Refunds and damages under paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be processed in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Protection of Content Users."
In order to protect the personal information of a member who has not used the Company's service continuously for one year from the most recent service usage date ("Dormant Account"), the Company may terminate the agreement and take necessary measures such as personal information destruction and separate storage. In this case, the Company will notify the member of the fact that necessary measures will be taken at least 30 days before the date of action, the expiration date of the personal information retention period, and the items of personal information.
