Homer takes your personal privacy very seriously, and we follow EU's data protection regulation, GDPR.
Your information belongs to you and is not shared with anyone else without your explicit consent.
You always have the right to - at no cost - get a copy of the information you have entered. We place great emphasis on protecting your information, both from loss and from unauthorised access.
You can read more about how we handle your personal data below:
What information do we process and for what purpose?
‍
Homer processes the following information in order to authenticate you as a valid user of the service:
⁃ your email
‍
We also process the following personal data in order to improve your experience of the service:

On behalf of you as a user, and with your consent, we process:
⁃ All the personal data you choose to add to the service in the form of pictures, text, links, and all other information.
You can choose to let Homer analyze more closely and search for more information about, for example, an object. Every single time you give Homer the task of seeking more information, you agree that qualified personnel can access that information in order to deliver the service. If you do not wish to give your consent to this, you may choose not to allow Homer to seek further information.
What data sources does Homer have?
For each account, you as the account holder and user are the primary source of data. You as a user can (with or without Homer's prompt) enter information - that according to GDPR's definition - is considered personal data.
In addition, Homer uses the following sources, among others:
⁃ Lantmäteriet
⁃ Sweden's municipalities and other public / governmental sources.
⁃ Google Maps
On what legal basis do we process your information?
For processing your email, Homer invokes the necessity to enter into an agreement and authenticate the user.
For all other processing of all personal data, Homer invokes
user consent as a legal basis
.
You can revoke your consent to the processing of your data at any time. In the simplest way, you can revoke the consent by deleting an individual piece of information within the service. A revocation does not affect the legality of the treatment before the consent was revoked.
A general and comprehensive revocation of your consent to process your personal data will also mean that your Homer account is terminated and your information permanently deleted. If you want a copy of your information, make sure to save it before you withdraw the consent and your information is deleted - see the section “Data portability”
What do we do with the information?
Homer processes (stores, analyzes, combines, sorts, annotates) the information in order to provide a service that creates value for you as a user.
In order to monetize the service, the information may also be processed in order to be able to target relevant advertising and offers from Homer or third parties. Third parties will not get access to any of your personal data without your consent in each specific case.
Who can we share your personal information with?
We do not share your information with third parties without your explicit consent in each specific case.
To provide the service, Homer uses various Data Processors. Homer has a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with these main suppliers:

Where do we process your personal data?
Your data is processed and stored within the EU, or in countries that, through the Privacy Shield Agreement, participate in EU’s data security umbrella.
How long do we save your information?
We store your information for a maximum of 2 years after you last logged in to the service, or until you actively choose to close your account.

How is your data protected?
Our highest priority is to protect your information and your data both from unauthorized access and from loss. We do this with a combination of industry standard technical solutions and processes.
You are an important part of the security work - you have to ensure your own login information is kept safe. If you suspect that someone may have access to your login information, you must immediately take steps such as changing your password and contacting Homer. Homer does not know your password in clear text.
How can you access your data?
This is called data portability. You can request to save a local version of the information we have processed about you. We will then send you a link to the information, saved as a so-called compressed ZIP file that is readable on ordinary computers.
