(as further detailed in the

4. How we Collect Personal Information
We collect personal information in a variety of ways, including: directly from you, from business partners, from technologies used at our locations, through online technologies (such as when you are interacting with us through our websites and apps), from third-party social networks and other third parties. Circle K encourages you to review the privacy policies of third parties as well. Third parties involved may use tracking methods such as but not limited to cookies to achieve their own business goals and purposes by relating and combining information about your usage of our websites and apps to any other personal information they may have collected on you.
More specifically, we collect personal information in the following ways:
A. DIRECTLY FROM YOU
We may collect personal information directly from you in our stores (including through our point-of-sales systems and other in-store interactive tools such as the LIFT screens), by mail, by email, over the telephone, through our websites and apps or in any other direct manner, for instance when you make a purchase, give us feedback on our stores and the products for sale in our stores, participate in a contest or survey, complete a franchise application, or make a request to our customer service.
For example:
Circle K offers many programs and services through which we may collect personal information directly from you, for instance: our brands’ main websites (e.g.,
https://www.circlek.com/
,
https://www.couche-tard.com/
and
http://www.holidaystationstores.com/
), gamification websites on which you may participate into a contest, our brands’ main apps (the Circle K, Couche Tard and Holiday apps), the Circle K Inner Circle loyalty program, the Circle K Easy Pay program, the Circle K EV chargers, our subscription services (such as the Car Wash and Sip&Save programs), our interactive LIFT screens at the point-of-sale, contests and sweepstakes or our newsletters.
B. FROM BUSINESS PARTNERS
Occasionally, we may receive personal information from business partners with whom we offer certain products at our stores or to provide certain programs. We may also receive your personal information from other sources with your consent or when authorized by law.
For example:
We may participate in the loyalty programs of our business partners, such as fuel companies and grocers, to allow participating customers to earn points and redeem rewards at our locations. In such case, your participation is subject to the privacy policy of our business partner and we collect from you and receive from our partners the information necessary to allow you to participate in the program.
We may receive your personal information from business partners with whom we organize contests, such as television stations, in order to allow you to redeem your prize at our stores.
C. AUTOMATICALLY FROM TECHNOLOGIES USED AT OUR LOCATIONS
We may collect personal information through various types of technologies used in our stores. These can include video surveillance, sensors or other similar types of systems that we may use from time to time.
For example:
We use video surveillance in areas surrounding our premises for security purposes, to protect against theft, to prevent damage to our properties, and to prevent fraud.
We may also use anonymous video analytic, which allows us to track the number of individuals in our stores and consider certain demographic information without identifying them. This technology helps us managing our stores, understanding our customer base and improving customer experience.
In certain selected and clearly identified stores, where we offer a frictionless experience, we may use video cameras and sensors to allow our customers who have signed up for frictionless check-out services to make purchases without having to go through the cashier.
In certain selected and clearly identified stores where we conduct research projects, such as the Connect Store at McGill Retail Innovation Lab, we may use video cameras and sensors (using Wi-Fi tracking, Bluetooth, RFID and similar technologies) to map individuals’ movements in the store and identify whatitems they take. This allows us to better understand in-store customer experience and to allow our customers who have signed up for frictionless check-out services to make purchases without having to go through the cashier.
D. THROUGH ONLINE TECHNOLOGIES
With your consent or as permitted under applicable law, we may collect certain types of information electronically when you interact with our websites and apps, emails, social media accounts, online advertising, or through the use of our or a third party’s technologies, which include cookies, web beacons or single pixel gifs or analytics engines. This information helps us understand what actions you take on our websites and apps and allows them to work correctly.
We may combine this information with other information collected in-store or online such as your transaction history. We do this to support our customer understanding using website and mobile analytics and to provide you with more tailored advertising and marketing campaigns. This includes serving interest-based advertising to you, subject to your right to withdraw consent. To learn more about the privacy choices available to you, please visit
How Can You Change Your Privacy Choices?
section below.
For example:
We may use your location or language preference to auto-select features when you visit our websites or download our apps.
We may use your personal transaction information to provide you with interest-based advertisements on products that we believe may interest you (e.g. products that you purchase frequently).
We may collect, combine and categorize your personal information on an aggregated basis to identify purchasing patterns to help us analyze our businesses to better serve our customers.
The technologies we use include:
Cookies, which are small text files that are saved on your computer when you visit a website so that information can be saved between visits, such as your login credentials or language preferences. For example, cookies allow you to log in quickly when you visit our websites.
Web beacons, and single pixel gifs, which are small image files that have information about you, such as your IP address, that can be downloaded when you visit a website or open an e-mail. This allows us to understand your online behaviour, monitor our email delivery, and provide you with interest-based advertising. These tools also allow our third-party tracking tools to gather information, such as your IP address, and provide this back to us in an anonymized, aggregate form (i.e. in a manner that prevents us from identifying you personally). Aggregate information refers to personal information compiled and expressed in a summary form where no personal identifiers are included.
Web analytics tools such as Google Analytics, which uses cookies to analyze your use of our websites and apps, to create reports about visitor and user activities for us and to provide further services associated with the use of our websites and apps.
Analytics engines, which pull usage data from multiple sources and help manage and collect this data to use for personalization, interest-based advertising, customizing content and other methods to gain insights into our customers’ needs and preferences.
With respect to our mobile applications, we use Identifier for Advertising for iOS and Google Advertising ID for Android.
Tools that help protect against inappropriate uses, such as Google Invisible reCAPTCHA, which collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data and the results of integrity checks, as well as unique online identifications such as IP address, and sends that data to Google for analysis.
You may delete or disable certain of these technologies at any time via your browser. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use some of the features on our websites. To learn more about the privacy choices available to you, please visit

In addition, third-party social networks that provide interactive plug-ins to enable social network features (e.g., to connect to Facebook) on our websites and apps may use cookies to gather information on your use of the websites and apps. How this collected data is used by a third party is dependent on the privacy policy of the social network which is available on the appropriate parties’ website. We may also obtain and use analytical and statistical information from third-party social networks to help us measure performance and effectiveness of content we display on social networks, for example, by measuring impressions and clicks on the content Circle K promotes.

9. How we Store and Safeguard Personal Information
We take the security of your personal information very seriously and are committed to protecting your privacy by using a combination of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Your personal information may be stored in foreign jurisdictions, in which case it will be subject to foreign laws. We will store your personal information in accordance with our retention policies or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
Learn more about
HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION,
WHERE WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS
,
[WF1]
and
HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION
.
A. HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
We employ organizational, physical and technological measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and to safeguard personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, in light of, among other things, the sensitivity of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used. These safeguards also apply when we dispose of or destroy your personal information. We use reasonable safeguards to ensure that our service providers protect your personal information wherever it is used or stored.
We implement a combination of policies and internal practices to protect your personal information, including:
A designated Privacy Officer tasked to monitor our compliance with applicable privacy laws;
Internal policies and procedures that define the roles and responsibilities of our employees throughout the life cycle of an item of information and limit their access to that information on a “need-to-know” basis and the retention of destruction of personal information;
Procedures for responding to complaints or inquiries related to privacy, including related any confidentiality incident involving personal information;
If the information is collected or stored electronically, technical safeguards such as encryption, firewalls, passwords, anti-virus software and similar measures;
Contractual protections and other measures to ensure that service providers with whom we share personal information maintain adequate protections and security standards. For example, we generally require our service providers to limit their use and retention of personal information to that which is necessary to perform their services and to notify us in the event of an actual or suspected confidentiality incident. We also attempt to monitor and verify their compliance with these requirements in a variety of ways (e.g., on-site inspections (where possible), surveys and interviews, proof of certification).
Employee training in privacy and information security.
Our objective is to prevent any unauthorize access, data loss, misuse, and unauthorized sharing of modification to personal information in our control. We also use these protection measures when we delete or destroy your personal information.
B. WHERE WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS
We may share personal information within the Circle K group of companies, including in Canada, the United States and the European Union. Some of our service providers may also access, process or store your personal information outside of the country or the province where we are located and where you reside. As a result, when your personal information is used or stored in a jurisdiction other than where you are residing, it may be subject to the law of this foreign jurisdiction, including any law permitting or requiring disclosure of the information to the government, government agencies, courts and law enforcement in that jurisdiction.
C. HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION
We will store your personal information in accordance with our retention policies or as otherwise required or permitted by law, after which your personal information will be securely destroyed or anonymized (so the information no longer identifies you).
10. Children Privacy
We do not knowingly request or collect personal information from children under 14 years of age without prior verifiable consent of his or her parent or legal guardian and complying with any other legal requirements. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information about a child without verifiable parental or legal guardian consent, we will delete this information from our records or take reasonable steps to de-identify the information.

11.1.2. Rights under CCPA and VCDPA.
(a) Making a Request and Scope of Requests.
We provide Consumers the privacy rights under the CCPA and VCDPA as described in this section.
You have the right to exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA and VCDPA and related regulations. Any request you submit to us is subject to an identity verification process (“
Verifiable Consumer Request
”) as described in the
Verifying Your Request
section below. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the consumer about whom we collected Personal Information. To make a request to know or delete, please submit your request to us by either:
Calling us at our toll-free number: 1-833-662-0510
Visiting our request portal:
Individual Rights Request Form
You may also obtain information on how to make, and may submit, a request by asking a manager at any of our California and Virginia locations, who will refer to these same two methods. Note that some Circle K locations are independently owned and operated by franchisees, in which case a request to us will not include Personal Information collected independently by them that was not shared with us.
Some Personal Information we maintain about consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough Personal Information about the consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular consumer’s Personal Information when a Consumer request that requires verification pursuant to the CCPA’s or VCDPA’s verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that Personal Information in response to those requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request. We will use Personal Information provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer Personal Information that we collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use and to respond to your California or Virginia Consumer privacy rights requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.
(b) Verifying Your Request.
In order for us to look into your request, we first need to verify your identity, meaning that we need to make sure that you are the consumer we may have collected Personal Information about or a person who has been duly authorized to make the request on behalf of the consumer.
To verify your identity, we ask that you to provide us with, at a minimum, your full name and phone number or email, and the nature in which you have transacted or interacted with us (e.g., in store or online, or both). Depending on the nature of the request and whether we have the phone number or email address you have provided in our systems, we will request further information from you in order to verify that you are the consumer about whom we have collected information.
For a specific pieces request and a request to delete important data, we are required to verify a consumer’s identity to high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by the Consumer with data points maintained by us (and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying the consumer), together with a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request. If we cannot verify you to that standard, we will treat the request as a categories request or a standard deletion request, for which we require a reasonable degree of certainty based on matched data. If we are unable to verify you to that standard, we will refer you to this U.S. State Notice.
(c) Authorizing an Agent.
You may designate an authorized agent to submit your consumer request on your behalf by submitting a request in the manners described above. If you are an authorized agent who would like to make a request, we are required to ensure that a right to know or deletion request made by an agent is a Verifiable Consumer Request and allows us to request further information to ensure that the Consumer has authorized the agent to make the request on their behalf. Generally, we will request that an agent provide proof that the Consumer gave the agent signed permission to submit the request and we also may require the Consumer to either verify their own identity or directly confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit the request.
(d) Your California and Virginia Consumer privacy rights are as follows:
(i) Right of Access.
(ii) Right Rectification.
(iii) Right of Deletion.
(iv) Right to Opt-Out of Sales.
(v) Right to Non-Discrimination for Exercise of Privacy Rights.
(vi) Right of Restriction.
(vii) Right of Portability.
(viii) California “Shine the Light” Notice.
