About this update:
We changed the operating entity of
Shelf
from BRAVO UNICORN PTE. LTD. to HEYTAP PTE. LTD.
Thank you for using Shelf. Shelf is a widget (the "App") on the home screen developed and operated by HEYTAP PTE. LTD. ("we", "us", or "our", registered at 138 Market Street #15-03 Capitagreen, Singapore 048946) to provide users ("you", or "your") with multiple features.
During your use of our accounts, websites, mobile apps, or other products or services, we may collect and use your personal information. In the Shelf Privacy Notice (this "Privacy Notice"), "personal information" or "personal data" refers to all information that can be used alone or in combination with other information to identify a natural person.
This Privacy Notice explains how we process your personal information, the purposes for which we collect, use, and disclose your personal information during your use of Shelf, your rights to your personal information, and the security measures we use to protect your personal information.
Before using Shelf, please carefully read this Privacy Notice to understand our practices regarding personal information protection. By tapping "Agree" to launch Shelf, you acknowledge that you fully understand the collection and use of personal information and your rights described below.
Regardless of your location, the general terms in Section A apply to you. Section B only applies to users located in the European Union, Liechtenstein, Norway, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland ("Europe"). Section C applies to users in the United States and is only applicable to users domiciled in California, Nevada, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah. Section C provides more details about personal information to meet the disclosure requirements under the laws of these states. Section D applies to the users in India.
In principle, this Privacy Notice applies to all jurisdictions where we have declared the provision of services through the App. However, different jurisdictions may have different requirements regarding personal information protection. Therefore, in addition to the general terms, we make a disclosure in the form of appendices of specific terms to meet the special requirements of different jurisdictions. The appendices, along with the main part of this Privacy Notice, constitute our notification of personal information processing in specific jurisdictions. If you are in a region listed in one of the appendices, you should also read the appendix applicable to your region. Unless otherwise specified in the appendices, the general terms of this Privacy Notice shall prevail. In case of any conflict or inconsistency between an appendix and the main part of this Privacy Notice, the appendix shall prevail.

General Provisions
How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information
The information we collect depends on the features or services you use, the context in which you interact with us, and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the features or services you use.
The features or services provided by the App may vary depending on the country or region in which a device is purchased, the operating system or app versions running on a device, and the apps installed or downloaded on a device. Therefore, the features or services actually provided by the App, personal information processing, and required app permissions are subject to the device you use.
You are not obliged to provide personal information to us. If you choose not to provide the personal information necessary for the App to provide the required services, we may not be able to provide you with such services, nor will we be able to respond to or deal with any problems you may encounter. We collect personal information to operate more efficiently and provide you with the best possible user experience. The following describes in detail what personal information we collect as well as how and why we collect and use such information.
We collect information about you in three primary ways:
• directly from you;
• automatically from your use of the App; and/or
• from third parties.
If the following clauses explicitly state that your relevant information is only kept locally, then the information is only collected and processed locally on your device and it will not be uploaded to our servers, which means such information is not bound by this Privacy Notice. This is to address any privacy concerns you may have and provide transparency about our processing of personal information.
Please note that if you provide other people's personal information to us, you must ensure that you have obtained their authorization.
1.1 App features, personal information we collect and use, and intended purposes
(1) Display of widgets
Shelf is designed to display widgets of apps to let you view key information or get instant services from these apps. Such apps include system apps, pre-installed apps, and other third-party apps. In order for Shelf to display widgets, relevant personal information will be processed locally on your device, which will not be uploaded to our server.
The widgets that will be displayed in the subscription list vary depending on the apps downloaded and installed on your device. When you add or view a widget, Shelf will redirect you to App Market, to the third-party website concerned, or launch the corresponding app that powers that widget if you have not downloaded, installed, or opened this app before. Such a widget will not display any data until you allow its corresponding app to process your personal information or authorize it to use relevant app permissions.
(2) Widget configurations, content operation, and service recommendations
We will configure widgets, deliver operation content, and recommend services to you based on your device's identifier (DUID), GAID, IP address, device information (device brand, device model, and system language settings), Shelf version, region, app list, app usage data, and more.
(3) Location-based service recommendations
In some countries and regions, we have launched a location-based service recommendation feature, which is displayed as a widget and jointly provided by us and a third-party service partner. Based on your location, this feature recommends nearby takeout and displays available ride-hailing drivers, their locations, and other related information. After you permit the App to access your location, it will share your location, GAID, and basic information relating to your device (region and language settings, information on whether the corresponding third-party app is installed, and more) with the third-party service partner, which will provide you with nearby takeout and ride-hailing services. In particular, you can choose to permit the App to access your fine or coarse location. If you permit its access to your fine location, we will provide you with more targeted recommendations based on this location information. To prevent the App from accessing your location, please go to "Settings - Apps - App management", tap the three-dot icon in the upper-right corner, choose "Show system", scroll down and tap "Shelf" to access its page, where you can tap "Permissions - Location" and choose "Deny". For information about the third-party service partner, please go to "Appendix: Our Partners" at the bottom of this Privacy Notice.
Tapping a widget may redirect you to a third-party app or website or any other service that is developed and operated by the third party (collectively, "third-party services"). Please note that such third-party services are not bound by this Privacy Notice. Before using such services, you should carefully read the privacy policy of the third party.
(4) User experience optimization
Shelf needs to collect event tracking information so we can understand the active user base and usage of product features in order to develop product strategies, improve our products and services, perform advertising and content recommendation attribution analysis, assess the effectiveness of advertising and recommendations, settle advertising fees, and manage business partnerships. Event tracking information primarily includes device identifiers, device information (including brand, model, sales region, and network type), system and application information (including system version, app versions, and app package names), event tracking data types, GAID (which has been encrypted), behavioral data (acts of adding, removing, and sliding on widgets, widget-specific impressions and taps, acts of launching and exiting Shelf, and more), data about cross-app launches, settings support data, cache data, status information, information on how you and your device interact with Shelf, the time and duration of your use of Shelf, the widgets used in Shelf, product feature usage statistics, etc.
(5) Personalized recommendations
The personalized recommendations function in Shelf is jointly provided by us and our partners. The recommended content may include product suggestions. You can view a list of our current partners in different countries and regions in the "Our Partners" section at the end of this Privacy Notice. To provide you with personalized recommendations, we need to collect your GAID and share it with our partners.
1.2 Cookies and other similar technologies
Currently, the App does not use cookies or any other similar technologies to collect or store user preferences or any information about you.
How We Store and Retain Your Personal Information
Pursuant to laws and regulations, we will retain your personal information for the minimum period needed to provide you with the required products and services. We will delete or anonymize your personal information upon the expiration of the retention period or when it can be deleted unless otherwise specified by applicable laws or regulations.
2.1 How long we store your personal information
The widgets displayed in the App will process your personal information only on your device to provide relevant services and will not upload such information to the server. Personal information needed for widget configuration, service recommendations, and optimization of the user experience as well as the location information and GAID needed for location-based service recommendations are deleted immediately after the corresponding functions are completed and are not stored on the server. The content involved in the attachment recommendation will be deleted from the server when the widget is disabled.
2.2 Where we store your personal information
As a company operating globally, we provide products and services through resources and servers around the world. For the purpose of ensuring the high quality of our services (such as ensuring a high processing speed) and subject to local data protection laws, we will store your personal data based on the region where your mobile phone is purchased or configured. We have established data centers in France, Singapore, India, and Indonesia. This means that your personal information may be transferred to or accessed from a jurisdiction outside the country or region where you use the relevant products or services.
You understand that there are different risks under different data protection laws. We will take measures to ensure that the data collected by us is processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws, and that, when your personal information moves across borders, it is as well protected as it is in the country or region where you use the relevant products or services. For example, we will obtain your consent to the cross-border transfer of your personal information or take security measures such as encryption, de-identification, or entering into a necessary data transfer/sharing agreement with the recipient of your data before transferring your data across borders.
Third-Party Service Providers and Their Services
3.1 Our cooperation with third-party service providers
Some of the features and services of the App are provided by third-party service partners. We will share personal information with such third parties as is necessary to provide you with the features or services you request. We will share your personal information only for legitimate, proper, necessary, specific, and explicit purposes, and we will share only the personal information necessary for the provision of the services. Such third parties will have no right to use your personal information shared by us for any other purpose. We will sign a data protection agreement with each third party to clarify their responsibility and obligation to protect your personal information.
Please go to "Appendix: Our Partners" at the bottom of this Privacy Notice to learn about the third-party services contained in our products or services.
3.2. Third-party service providers and their services
Some of our features or services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, such as the third-party apps and websites redirected when you tap a relevant widget in the App.<b>This Privacy Notice does not apply to such third-party websites, products, or services.
After you are directed to such third-party websites, products, or services, please carefully read the privacy policies and related terms and conditions of the third-party website operators or service providers before you access specific functional modules or services.
How to Exercise Your Data Subject Rights
We respect your rights to your personal information, and we do our best to protect your rights. We provide a variety of secure and convenient ways for you to configure privacy settings and manage personal information, thus ensuring the security of your personal information. Please note that the settings may vary by device model, operating system version, and App version. In addition, we may adjust the settings from time to time to improve your user experience.

4.5 Right to change the scope of authorization or withdraw consent
The performance of each service function requires certain basic personal information (see the "How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information" section of this Privacy Notice). You can change the scope of the personal information you authorize us to collect or withdraw your authorization by deleting information, turning off app permissions, changing settings on the product or feature settings page, or deleting your account.

You have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority regarding our personal information protection practices or file a lawsuit in a court with jurisdiction. However, we hope that we have the opportunity to solve your concerns or issues before you contact relevant authorities, so please first contact us directly.
How We Protect Minors' Personal Information
We greatly value our obligation and responsibility for protecting the personal information of children. We strive to create a healthy cyber environment for them and make extra efforts to protect them. We treat anyone under the age of 18 (or a similar minimum age of full legal capacity defined in the jurisdiction concerned) as a child.
Most of the features and services provided by the App are intended for adults, not for children. We do not provide services directly to children. Please note that due to technical limitations and other objective factors, the App may not be able to actively identify the age of users.
According to applicable laws and regulations, if you are a child, you must obtain the consent of your parent or another guardian before using the App, and be sure to carefully read this Privacy Notice together with them. If you are the guardian of a child, before assisting the child in using the App, you must carefully read both the Children's Privacy Statement (if any) and this Privacy Notice. Please note that children are not allowed to use the App without the consent of their parents or guardians.
We do not actively collect, store, use, transfer, or disclose children's personal information, let alone use their personal information for marketing purposes. If you are a child, or if you are a parent or guardian of a child, or if you otherwise find that any information we processed may contain the personal information of a child, please contact us as set forth in this Privacy Notice. We will do everything we can to delete the relevant data as soon as possible.

Appendix: Europe-Specific Privacy Notice (GDPR-based Terms)
This section only applies to users located in the European Union, Liechtenstein, Norway, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland ("Europe").
GDPR divides roles in personal data processing into data controller and data processor. A data controller refers to any natural person, legal person, public authority, institution, or group that, alone or together with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. (It is almost the same concept as the personal information processor in "General Terms"). A data processor refers to any natural person, legal person, public authority, agency institution, or group that processes personal data on behalf of a data controller. (It is almost the same concept as the party that is entrusted to process personal information described in "General Terms"). If you are a user located in Europe, HEYTAP PTE. LTD. acts as the "data controller" as defined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and is able to determine the purpose for which your personal information is collected and processed and process your personal information in compliance with this Privacy Notice and applicable terms in the GDPR.
The personal information herein (also "personal data") refers to any information related to a natural person that has been identified or is identifiable. Personal data of special types refers to sensitive personal data which includes data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as data for unique identification of a natural person, such as genetic data, biometric data, health data, or data relating to sex life or sexual orientation.
1. Legal Grounds for the Processing of Personal Information

(1) We have obtained your express consent in advance, and you can withdraw your consent at any time;
(2) Information processing is necessary for us to enter into a contract or perform the contract concerning our products and/or services;
(3) The processing of relevant personal information is indispensable for fulfilling our legal obligations;
(4) Disclosing your personal information is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party. We will process your personal information on this lawful basis only after balancing our or the third party's interests against your privacy rights.
2. Scope of Personal Information We Process and the Purposes
In Europe, we provide the following features:
app widget display, feature configuration, widgets, operational content delivery, and product experience optimization
.
When you use Shelf, we may collect, use, or disclose your personal information for the purposes and procedures below or for other reasonably related purposes:

3. Additional Information on How Your Personal Information Is Transferred Globally
We determine your location based on the country/region you have selected in system settings.
In principle, personal information generated and collected in the European Union will be stored in the European Union. Where your personal information is transferred to a country or region outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will take the necessary security measures. For example, we will ensure that:
The recipient is located in a country that the European Commission has, through an adequacy decision, recognized as providing adequate protection;
The recipient has signed a contract in accordance with the "Standard Contractual Clauses" issued by the European Commission, requiring them to protect your personal information; or
In the absence of appropriate safeguards, we will obtain your express consent for the transfer of your personal information. In addition, we will use techniques such as encryption or de-identification to protect your personal information.
For more information about the safeguards relating to personal data transfers outside Europe, please submit your request through:

4.5 Right to object
You are entitled to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to any processing based on your legitimate interests. Should you decide to object to the processing, we will stop processing the personal information concerning you, unless we can demonstrate compelling reasons for continued processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or in the case that we establish, exercise, or defend our legal claims. You can object to direct marketing activities at any time for any reason.
4.6 Right to data portability
You are entitled to obtain a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and transmit such data to another provider. In certain circumstances, you can transmit your personal data to any other provider.

We will respond to your complaint as soon as possible. In general, we will respond within one month following the receipt of your complaint.

You may be able to limit our use of your Personal Data to display targeted advertisements on behalf of our advertisers, by adjusting your preference through our Grab App. Depending on the type of phone and operating software that you are using, you may be granted the option to disable our use of mobile identifiers (such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s GAID) and the ability to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies by adjusting the settings available on your mobile devices. Through adjusting the settings on your device, you can typically reset, delete, limit and/or otherwise restrict the use of such mobile identifiers.
Although we will not use your Personal Data to show you such targeted advertisements on other platforms, you may still see generic ads that appear relevant to you. This may be because we have engaged third party advertisers / platforms to display ads to users of specific attributes or demographic makeups who may find them relevant. You may be able to limit seeing these advertisements through managing your preferences on these platforms.
VII. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
We will take reasonable legal, physical, organisational and technical measures to ensure that your Personal Data is protected. This includes measures to prevent Personal Data from getting lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your Personal Data to our employees on a need to know basis. Those processing your Personal Data will only do so in an authorised manner and are required to treat your information with confidentiality.
Nevertheless, please understand that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted through any online means, therefore, any transmission remains at your own risk.
VIII. YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA
In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, you may be entitled to:
inquire about the processing of your Personal Data and be provided with a copy of it;
request the correction and/or deletion of your Personal Data;
request the restriction of or object to the processing of your Personal Data;
withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data within our possession or control (if the legal basis for such processing is based on your consent);
request receipt or transmission to another organisation, in a machine-readable form, of the Personal Data that you have provided to us where we are using your Personal Data based on consent or performance of a contract; and
complain to the relevant data privacy authority if your data privacy rights are violated, or if you have suffered detriment as a result of unlawful processing of your Personal Data.
If you are given the option to share your Personal Data with us and you choose not to, or subsequently withdraw your consent for our use of it,  this could mean that we are unable to perform the actions necessary to achieve the purposes of processing described in
Section II (Use of Personal Data)
or that you are unable to make use of App or the Services in such circumstances. We may be able to continue to process your Personal Data to the extent required or otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations.
We will screen and verify all requests. In order to verify your authority to make the request, we may require you to provide supporting information or documentation to corroborate the request. Once verified, we will give effect to your request within the timelines prescribed by applicable laws.

ADDENDUM 1: GRAB FOR BUSINESS
I. INTERPRETATION
All capitalised terms but undefined terms used herein shall bear the same meaning as those defined in the Terms of Use and Grab’s Privacy Notice
This Addendum forms part of the Grab Privacy Notice. In the event of any inconsistency between the Grab Privacy Notice and this Addendum, this Addendum shall prevail.
II. GRAB’S RELATIONSHIP WITH USERS AND CLIENTS
How Grab for Business works
Grab for Business is provided as an add-on feature for organisations (“Client”) to facilitate corporate billing for itsAuthorised Users’ (e.g. employees) use of Grab’s Services in the course of work.
When a Client chooses to utilise Grab for Business, the Authorised User is given the option of tagging his/her rides or other transactions to the Client or to tag it as a personal ride. As part of this feature, Grab will disclose detailed trip and booking information that Authorised Users have tagged as being for business purposes to the Client. Apart from this, Grab does not disclose other Personal Data of Authorised Users to the Client.
Alternatively, an individual user may choose to set up a business profile within the App to facilitate the tagging of business-related rides and to generate consolidated trip reports to facilitate the submission of claims from his or her employer. When used in this mode, the claims process is user-driven and the user’s employer need not be a Client.
For ease of reference, Authorised Users and individual users will each be referred to as a “User” and collectively as “
Users
” in this Addendum.
Grab is a data controller, so are our Clients
In respect of any User and the processing of their Personal Data ,
Grab acts as a data controller
. For further information on how Grab collects, uses and discloses Users’ Personal Data, please refer to the Grab Privacy Notice.
Due to the way Grab for Business works, Grab does not process any Personal Data for and on behalf of the Client. Accordingly,
Grab is not the data processor of the Client
, but
an independent data controller
in respect of all Personal Data that it processes in the course of providing the Grab for Business feature. Likewise, the Client is an independent data controller of the Personal Datathat it discloses to and/or receives from Grab.
As independent controllers, Grab and the Client individually determine the purposes and means of processing Personal Data, subject to the provisions set out in the Terms of Use and this Privacy Notice. Grab and the Client are also individually responsible to ensure the protection of Personal Data under their charge.
III. WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED, PROCESSED AND DISCLOSED

where applicable, linking the Authorised User’s account with the Client’s Grab for Business account or tracking the Authorised User’s business profile bookings on the Apps, as the case may be;
where applicable, verifying the Corporate Billing status of such Authorised User from time to time; and
contacting the User in accordance with the purposes set out in the Grab Privacy Notice .
