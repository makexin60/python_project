AT&T Privacy Notice
Thank you for reading our Privacy Notice. Your privacy is important to you and to us. This notice explains how we use your information and keep it safe.
Importantly, it explains the choices you can make at any time about how your information may be used.
This notice applies to AT&T products and services including internet, wireless, voice and AT&T apps. We will tell you if a different notice applies. For example:
Cricket and DIRECTV (including U-verse TV) have their own privacy notices.
AT&T business customers may have a service agreement that covers the handling of information. The service agreement controls if it is different from this Privacy Notice.
For AT&T business customers outside the United States,
the AT&T Business Customer Privacy Notice – Most of World
governs if different from this Privacy Notice.
Please make sure everyone who uses your account knows they are covered by this notice.
The information we collect
To better run our business, we collect information about you, your equipment and how you use our products and services. This can include:
Account information.
You give us information about yourself, such as contact and billing information. We also keep service-related history and details, including
Customer Proprietary Network Information
.
Equipment information.
We collect information about equipment on our network like the type of device you use, device ID, and phone number.
Network performance.
We monitor and test the health and performance of our network. This includes your use of Products and Services to show how our network and your device are working.
Location information.
Location data is automatically generated when devices, products and services interact with cell towers and Wi-Fi routers. Location can also be generated by Bluetooth services, network devices and other tech, including GPS satellites.
Web browsing and app information
. We automatically collect a variety of information which may include time spent on websites or apps, website and IP addresses and advertising IDs. It also can include links and ads seen, videos watched, search terms entered and items placed in online AT&T shopping carts. We may use pixels, cookies and similar tools to collect this information. We don’t decrypt information from secure websites or apps – such as passwords or banking information.
Biometric information.
Fingerprints, voice prints and face scans are examples of biological characteristics that may be used to identify individuals. Learn more in our
Biometric Information Privacy Notice
.
Third-party information.
We get information from outside sources like credit reports, marketing mailing lists and commercially available demographic and geographic data. Social media posts also may be collected, if you reach out to us directly or mention AT&T. Sometimes this data is de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized.
All these types of information are considered Personal Information when they can reasonably be linked to you as an identifiable person or household. For instance, information is personal when it can be linked to your name, account number or device.

How we use your information
We rely on the information we collect to support our business functions, power our services and improve your experience, such as when we:
Combine it with the information from testing and running our network to determine which products and services better meet the needs of our customers.
Provide our products and services.
Contact you.
Improve your experience and safety. This includes verifying your identity, detecting and preventing fraud, protecting your financial accounts, authorizing transactions and assisting your interactions with customer care.
Improve and protect our network.
Use it to help understand which additional products and services may interest you and others. (We don’t access or use the content of your texts, emails or calls for this or any other marketing and advertising.)
Design and deliver advertising, marketing and promotional campaigns to you and others – and measuring their effectiveness (
See your choices
).
Use it for billing, collection, and protection of our property and legal rights.
Prevent and investigate security issues, illegal activities, and violations of our terms and conditions.
De-identify, aggregate, or anonymize it to protect your privacy and security. We don’t try to re-identify this data like attempting to associate it with an individual person except to evaluate the effectiveness of our de-identification policies and procedures.
Conduct research and create aggregated reports – reports that offer insights about groups of customers, but not individuals (we do not attempt to re-identify individuals in aggregated reports).
Close
How we share your information
As described in the following paragraphs, AT&T shares information within our own AT&T companies and affiliates. We also share with non-AT&T companies.
AT&T affiliates.
We share information that identifies you personally with our
affiliates
, such as DIRECTV and Cricket. When we share this information, they must follow this Privacy Notice regarding your info, not just their own policy. This includes the
privacy choices
you make with AT&T.
AT&T affiliates and non-AT&T companies for advertising and marketing.
We may share information with affiliates and other companies to deliver our ads and marketing or to assess their effectiveness. (Learn more about our ad programs and see
your choices
.)
Non-AT&T companies providing a service.
We use suppliers for services like marketing and mailing bills and to support our products. When we share your information with suppliers, we require them to use it only for the intended purpose and to protect it consistent with this notice.
Non-AT&T companies for identity verification.
We share your information to protect you from fraud, authenticate your identity, protect your financial accounts and authorize transactions. When we share with companies like your bank for this purpose, we require them to use it only for the intended purpose and to protect it consistent with this notice. (Learn more and
see your choices
, including your right to decline this service.)
Non-AT&T companies and non-branded affiliates with your consent.
If we have your opt-in consent, we may share your information consistent with your direction.
Non-AT&T companies or entities where authorized or required by law.
This can happen when we:
Comply with court orders, subpoenas, and lawful discovery requests, and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we must comply with legal requirements. You can learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
Detect and prevent fraud.
Provide or obtain information related to payment for your service.
Route your calls or other communications, like connecting calls or text messages with other carrier networks.
Ensure network operations and security, defend against legal claims and enforce our legal rights.
Notify, respond, or provide information (including location) to an appropriate governmental entity in emergency circumstances such as immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.
Alert the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography if we become aware through the provision of our services.
Share the names, addresses and telephone numbers of non-mobile phone customers with phone directory publishers and directory assistance services as required by law. We honor your request for non-published or non-listed numbers.
Provide name and phone number for wireline and wireless Caller ID and related services like Call Trace.
Non-AT&T companies for metrics, insights and research.
We may share aggregated (grouped) data that does not identify you personally for these purposes. We require that companies and entities agree not to attempt to identify individuals – or allow others to do so. We share in this manner for:
Metrics:
Sometimes you enjoy a service from us that directly involves another business. For instance, we might provide the Wi-Fi service at a place you visit. As part of our service, we may provide aggregate metrics reports to that business about how the Wi-Fi is being used, such as aggregated location and web-browsing data. It can only be used for group insights.
Insights:
We may share aggregated data about our network, operations or services.
Research:
We may share information for research. We require the entities to handle the data securely and not reuse or resell it.
Non-AT&T companies for location services.
With your consent, we may share your location information for traffic and mapping apps and other location services to which you subscribe. We share only with your consent unless required by law. Keep in mind:
You may give your consent to us, or you may give it directly to another company – like a medical alerting device company.
If you give it directly to another company, that company governs the use or disclosure of location.
In some cases, such as parental controls, consent may come from the AT&T account holder and not the individual user.
Close
Your privacy choices and controls
You can manage how we use and share your information for certain activities including advertising and marketing. Here are key examples:
Sharing or selling my personal information.
We may share limited information to create, deliver, and measure advertisements for things you might like. This includes targeted advertising, which may be based on personal data obtained from your interactions with other businesses. We also share information in ways that may be considered a sale of information under some state laws, such as exchanging subscriber lists for marketing.
You can ask us to stop at any time, just:
Visit
att.com/PrivacyChoices
or our
Choices and Controls page
page to control if we can share or sell your personal information.
Contact us at (866) 385-3193 if you are a California resident.
We recognize and honor the preference signal associated with a
Global Privacy Control
.
Access, delete and correct your personal information.
You can ask to see what personal information we have about you. You can also ask us to delete or correct it.
Access and Portability.
If you want to see the personal information we’ve collected, you can ask us for it. We will describe the categories of info we collect, the specific pieces we’ve collected, the sources of the information, the purposes for collecting, sharing or selling it and the categories of non-AT&T companies with whom we shared it. You can also ask to “port” your data, which means you get a copy that you can take with you.
Delete.
You can ask us to delete your personal information. In keeping with various state laws, please know that we will still keep data needed for things like running the business, security and fraud protection, compliance with legal obligations and marketing our products and services to our own customers.
Correct.
You can ask us to correct inaccurate personal information we have about you. We’ll ask you to provide documentation to support the correction and let you know the result.
To access, delete or correct your information, visit our
Choices and Controls page
. California residents can also contact us at (866) 385-3193. Helpful details about the process can be found at
our Data Request Center
, including your option to appeal.
We don’t mind if you make access, deletion or correction requests, or ask us not to sell or share information. These are rights under certain state laws, and we have extended their availability to others across the U.S., regardless of where you live.
As required by California law, you can review information specifically about California requests from the previous calendar year on our
California metrics page
. We also follow state requirements within California regarding
businesses
and
those that provide work for us.
Personalized and Personalized Plus
AT&T has two programs that use your personal information to help customize your experience. For instance, you might be shown an online advertisement that is more relevant to your interests, rather than a general ad.
You can choose to participate or not – and it’s never a problem if you change your mind. You are automatically enrolled in the Personalized program, but you can always opt out. You must opt in to join Personalized Plus. Choices for both programs can be made at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
Here is a comparison of the programs:
*If you live in certain states, we won’t collect, use, store or share your sensitive personal information for marketing and advertising unless you join Personalized Plus. This includes information like ethnicity and racial origin. The states are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.
If you join the Personalized Plus program, it is an extension of the Personalized program, and you will be enrolled in both. Regardless of your selection to participate in either program, you are always in control of the sharing or selling of your personal information, see the “Your privacy choices and controls” section.  And if you choose not to allow the sharing and selling of your personal information, you will be enrolled only in portions of Personalized Plus that don’t sell or share your information externally.
More choices and controls
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI).
CPNI is information related to the telecommunications services you purchase from us, such as which subscription plan you have and details about who you called. Your phone number, name and address are not CPNI. It is your right and our duty under federal law to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.
You can choose whether we use your CPNI internally for marketing – such as helping to offer you new services and promotions.
You can opt out at
att.com/cpni/optout
. You can also call us any time at
(800) 315-8303
and follow the prompts. Or you can talk to a service representative at
(800) 288-2020 (consumer)
or
(800) 321-2000 (business)
.
We don’t share CPNI outside of our AT&T affiliates, agents and suppliers without your consent except for court orders, fraud detection, providing service, network operations and security, aggregate (grouped) information that doesn’t identify you personally and as otherwise authorized by law.
If you choose to restrict our use of CPNI, it won’t affect your services. We keep your choice until you change your mind, which you can do at any time. Keep in mind, even if you restrict use of your CPNI, you may still get marketing from us.
Identity verification.
Non-AT&T companies like your bank may receive limited information from us to help protect your accounts from fraud, verify your identity and make sure it’s really you authorizing a transaction. We do not allow these non-AT&T companies to use your information for any purpose except supporting those services. You are generally enrolled through the non-AT&T company, but you can stop at any time through us. Text “STOP” to 8010 to turn off Identity Verification, or text “RESUME” to restart. Or manage your choices at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
Contact preferences.
We like to tell you about offers and programs that may interest you. You can manage how we do that. Keep in mind that we still may need to contact you with service and non-marketing messages. Please visit
Contact Preferences
for more information and links.
Industry choices and controls
Online behavioral advertising.
You have industry-wide choices about online, interest-based advertising.
Companies including AT&T may use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of websites including ours. This information can be used to analyze and track online activity or deliver ads and content tailored to your interests.
You can opt out of online behavioral advertising from companies that participate in the
Digital Advertising Alliance
. Go to their
Consumer Choice Page
. You can also select this icon
when you see it on an online ad.
You can limit collection of data on websites by
managing cookies and similar technologies
on your computer. Remember that if you change computers, devices, or web browsers, or if you delete cookies, you will need to manage them again.
At AT&T, please note that when we collect web browsing information as an internet service provider, it works independently of your web browser’s cookie and private browsing settings that interact with online behavioral advertising. You can manage AT&T’s use of web browsing information – such as our Personalized Plus program – at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
We don’t currently respond to Do Not Track. Please go to
All About Do Not Track
for more information.
Unless you join our Personalized Plus ad program, we don’t knowingly allow non-AT&T companies to collect your personally identifiable activity on our websites for their own use and tracking.
Close
Data retention and security
We keep your information as long as we need it for business, tax or legal purposes. We set our retention periods based on things like what type of personal information it is, how long it’s needed to operate the business or provide our products and services, and whether it’s subject to contractual or legal obligations. These obligations might be ongoing litigation, mandatory data retention laws or government orders to preserve data for an investigation. After that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or indecipherable.
We work hard to safeguard your information using technology controls and organizational controls. We protect our computer storage and network equipment. We require employees to authenticate themselves to access sensitive data. We limit access to personal information to the people who need access for their jobs. And we require callers and online users to authenticate themselves before we provide account information.
No security measures are perfect. We can’t guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this notice. If a breach occurs, we’ll notify you as required by law.

Cookies and Other Technologies
Definitions
Let's start with what we mean when we use the word "cookie" and other related terms:
Cookies
are small data files. Websites place them in your browser to recognize your computer

                    or

                    mobile device when you return to that site. Cookies are created to keep track of your movements

                    within

                    the site, help you resume where you

                    left off, remember your registered username, preferences and other customizations.
There are a couple of important things to remember about cookies:
Disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on some websites. You’ll need to

                        perform the opt out procedure if you opt out of a program or service and then change computers

                        or

                        Web browsers, or clear or erase the digital

                        "cookie" that lets us know you opted out.
Local Storage Cookies.
Local Storage is a convenient, flexible, secure and faster way to

                        store HTTP state data. It is a method by which our web pages locally store named key/value pairs

                        in

                        a user’s web browser. Local storage on

                        ATT.com is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from our domains. Local storage

                        data

                        is session-based and will not persist once the session is over and the browser is closed.
Flash Cookies
(also called Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") are similar to cookies, except

                that they can store more complex data. They are used to remember your settings, preferences and usage,

                and

                other similar services. Flash

                cookies allow functionality and availability of certain services. If disabled, these services may not

                function correctly. While browser cookies may be removed or blocked via web browser settings, flash

                cookies

                operate differently. Please note

                that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the

                functionality of some Flash applications. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit

                the
Adobe website
and make changes

                at
Global Storage Settings Panel

Web beacons
are small graphic images on a Web page or in an e-mail. They can be used for things

                like

                recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing

                campaign performs.
A
widget
is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. It can provide

                real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports. Widgets are often provided by a third

                party

                and allow them to collect data about

                users viewing that page.
A
server log
records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in

                improving web page performance and introducing new features. For example, it may record which search

                terms

                you’ve entered, or the links you’ve

                clicked on. It may also record your browser information, such as your IP address, device type, how long

                you

                spend on a Web page, and your browser's cookies.
Some websites have “
social network or other third-party plug-ins
.” These plug-ins may provide

                information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in. It may also

                apply

                even if you don’t have an account

                with them. Social networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser.

                This

                might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address and the URL

                of

                the web page where the

                plug-in appears. If you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to

                familiarize

                yourself with their privacy policies.

AT&T Consumer Marketing
AT&T will maintain a company-specific (Internal) Do Not Mail (DNM) list of existing and prospective

            residential customers who request not to receive any AT&T marketing materials via US Postal Mail.
Consumers must contact the AT&T residential care center at 1-800-288-2020 and specify each individual

                member of the household and each associated address to be added to the DNM list.
Generally AT&T processes DNM requests within 30 days. However, because our mailings are processed well

                in advance, you may continue to receive additional offers for some time after the request date.'
Please note that AT&T may direct mail market to certain neighborhoods or zip

                        codes. These offerings are delivered to all homes in a neighborhood or zip code. You may continue to

                        receive this type of mailing even if you opt-out of receiving

                        marketing related postal mailings from AT&T.
DNM requests for an individual consumer at a residential address will remain in effect for THREE years from

                the date of request.
AT&T does not accept DNM requests from third party providers.
AT&T DNM requests will expire upon change of address.
AT&T will not share or disclose DNM information with any third party other than AT&T vendors responsible

            for direct mail marketing on AT&T's behalf.
Notifications and other non-solicitation mail pieces are exempt from this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM

            Policy.
AT&T reserves the right to discontinue this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy, and may cease

            accepting DNM requests or otherwise modify this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy.

We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:
We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.

As of November 1, these additional key changes will take effect for AT&T customers under our revised policy:
We may collect, use or share biometric information for fraud prevention and security purposes.
If you opt in to our Enhanced Relevant Advertising program, we may use other information from testing and
            running our network to make inferences regarding web browsing and videos watched over secure connections to
            personalize your experience or
            deliver more relevant marketing messages and offers to you. Keep in mind that we don’t access sensitive
            information or break encryption, and we don’t use the content of texts, emails or phone calls for marketing
            or advertising.
If we share information with third parties for purposes such as verifying your identity and protecting your
            financial accounts, you can manage this sharing of information simply by going to
Manage Privacy Choices
.
We are committed to keeping your information secure, as well as providing you with Choices and Controls for how
        your information is used. You can visit the
Choices and
            Controls
section of our
Privacy Center

        settings. Your service is not affected by these changes, and your continued use of our services indicates your
        acceptance of these changes.

                otherwise

                directly communicate with us.
We automatically get it
when you use, or your device uses, our Products

                or

                Services. For example, we use network tools to collect information like call and

                text

                records and the web browsing information we describe in this Policy.
We get it from outside sources

                lists, and

                commercially available geographic and demographic information, along with other

                available information, such as public posts to social networking sites.

AT&T Privacy Notice
Thank you for reading our Privacy Notice. Your privacy is important to you and to us. This notice explains how we use your information and keep it safe.
Importantly, it explains the choices you can make at any time about how your information may be used.
This notice applies to AT&T products and services including internet, wireless, voice and AT&T apps. We will tell you if a different notice applies. For example:
Cricket and DIRECTV (including U-verse TV) have their own privacy notices.
AT&T business customers may have a service agreement that covers the handling of information. The service agreement controls if it is different from this Privacy Notice.
For AT&T business customers outside the United States,
the AT&T Business Customer Privacy Notice – Most of World
governs if different from this Privacy Notice.
Please make sure everyone who uses your account knows they are covered by this notice.
The information we collect
To better run our business, we collect information about you, your equipment and how you use our products and services. This can include:
Account information.
You give us information about yourself, such as contact and billing information. We also keep service-related history and details, including
Customer Proprietary Network Information
.
Equipment information.
We collect information about equipment on our network like the type of device you use, device ID, and phone number.
Network performance.
We monitor and test the health and performance of our network. This includes your use of Products and Services to show how our network and your device are working.
Location information.
Location data is automatically generated when devices, products and services interact with cell towers and Wi-Fi routers. Location can also be generated by Bluetooth services, network devices and other tech, including GPS satellites.
Web browsing and app information
. We automatically collect a variety of information which may include time spent on websites or apps, website and IP addresses and advertising IDs. It also can include links and ads seen, videos watched, search terms entered and items placed in online AT&T shopping carts. We may use pixels, cookies and similar tools to collect this information. We don’t decrypt information from secure websites or apps – such as passwords or banking information.
Biometric information.
Fingerprints, voice prints and face scans are examples of biological characteristics that may be used to identify individuals. Learn more in our
Biometric Information Privacy Notice
.
Third-party information.
We get information from outside sources like credit reports, marketing mailing lists and commercially available demographic and geographic data. Social media posts also may be collected, if you reach out to us directly or mention AT&T. Sometimes this data is de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized.
All these types of information are considered Personal Information when they can reasonably be linked to you as an identifiable person or household. For instance, information is personal when it can be linked to your name, account number or device.
Close
How we use your information
We rely on the information we collect to support our business functions, power our services and improve your experience, such as when we:
Combine it with the information from testing and running our network to determine which products and services better meet the needs of our customers.
Provide our products and services.
Contact you.
Improve your experience and safety. This includes verifying your identity, detecting and preventing fraud, protecting your financial accounts, authorizing transactions and assisting your interactions with customer care.
Improve and protect our network.
Use it to help understand which additional products and services may interest you and others. (We don’t access or use the content of your texts, emails or calls for this or any other marketing and advertising.)
Design and deliver advertising, marketing and promotional campaigns to you and others – and measuring their effectiveness (
See your choices
).
Use it for billing, collection, and protection of our property and legal rights.
Prevent and investigate security issues, illegal activities, and violations of our terms and conditions.
De-identify, aggregate, or anonymize it to protect your privacy and security. We don’t try to re-identify this data like attempting to associate it with an individual person except to evaluate the effectiveness of our de-identification policies and procedures.
Conduct research and create aggregated reports – reports that offer insights about groups of customers, but not individuals (we do not attempt to re-identify individuals in aggregated reports).
Close
How we share your information
As described in the following paragraphs, AT&T shares information within our own AT&T companies and affiliates. We also share with non-AT&T companies.
AT&T affiliates.
We share information that identifies you personally with our
affiliates
, such as DIRECTV and Cricket. When we share this information, they must follow this Privacy Notice regarding your info, not just their own policy. This includes the
privacy choices
you make with AT&T.
AT&T affiliates and non-AT&T companies for advertising and marketing.
We may share information with affiliates and other companies to deliver our ads and marketing or to assess their effectiveness. (Learn more about our ad programs and see
your choices
.)
Non-AT&T companies providing a service.
We use suppliers for services like marketing and mailing bills and to support our products. When we share your information with suppliers, we require them to use it only for the intended purpose and to protect it consistent with this notice.
Non-AT&T companies for identity verification.
We share your information to protect you from fraud, authenticate your identity, protect your financial accounts and authorize transactions. When we share with companies like your bank for this purpose, we require them to use it only for the intended purpose and to protect it consistent with this notice. (Learn more and
see your choices
, including your right to decline this service.)
Non-AT&T companies and non-branded affiliates with your consent.
If we have your opt-in consent, we may share your information consistent with your direction.
Non-AT&T companies or entities where authorized or required by law.
This can happen when we:
Comply with court orders, subpoenas, and lawful discovery requests, and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we must comply with legal requirements. You can learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
Detect and prevent fraud.
Provide or obtain information related to payment for your service.
Route your calls or other communications, like connecting calls or text messages with other carrier networks.
Ensure network operations and security, defend against legal claims and enforce our legal rights.
Notify, respond, or provide information (including location) to an appropriate governmental entity in emergency circumstances such as immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.
Alert the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography if we become aware through the provision of our services.
Share the names, addresses and telephone numbers of non-mobile phone customers with phone directory publishers and directory assistance services as required by law. We honor your request for non-published or non-listed numbers.
Provide name and phone number for wireline and wireless Caller ID and related services like Call Trace.
Non-AT&T companies for metrics, insights and research.
We may share aggregated (grouped) data that does not identify you personally for these purposes. We require that companies and entities agree not to attempt to identify individuals – or allow others to do so. We share in this manner for:
Metrics:
Sometimes you enjoy a service from us that directly involves another business. For instance, we might provide the Wi-Fi service at a place you visit. As part of our service, we may provide aggregate metrics reports to that business about how the Wi-Fi is being used, such as aggregated location and web-browsing data. It can only be used for group insights.
Insights:
We may share aggregated data about our network, operations or services.
Research:
We may share information for research. We require the entities to handle the data securely and not reuse or resell it.
Non-AT&T companies for location services.
With your consent, we may share your location information for traffic and mapping apps and other location services to which you subscribe. We share only with your consent unless required by law. Keep in mind:
You may give your consent to us, or you may give it directly to another company – like a medical alerting device company.
If you give it directly to another company, that company governs the use or disclosure of location.
In some cases, such as parental controls, consent may come from the AT&T account holder and not the individual user.
Close
Your privacy choices and controls
You can manage how we use and share your information for certain activities including advertising and marketing. Here are key examples:
Sharing or selling my personal information.
We may share limited information to create, deliver, and measure advertisements for things you might like. This includes targeted advertising, which may be based on personal data obtained from your interactions with other businesses. We also share information in ways that may be considered a sale of information under some state laws, such as exchanging subscriber lists for marketing.
You can ask us to stop at any time, just:
Visit
att.com/PrivacyChoices
or our
Choices and Controls page
page to control if we can share or sell your personal information.
Contact us at (866) 385-3193 if you are a California resident.
We recognize and honor the preference signal associated with a
Global Privacy Control
.
Access, delete and correct your personal information.
You can ask to see what personal information we have about you. You can also ask us to delete or correct it.
Access and Portability.
If you want to see the personal information we’ve collected, you can ask us for it. We will describe the categories of info we collect, the specific pieces we’ve collected, the sources of the information, the purposes for collecting, sharing or selling it and the categories of non-AT&T companies with whom we shared it. You can also ask to “port” your data, which means you get a copy that you can take with you.
Delete.
You can ask us to delete your personal information. In keeping with various state laws, please know that we will still keep data needed for things like running the business, security and fraud protection, compliance with legal obligations and marketing our products and services to our own customers.
Correct.
You can ask us to correct inaccurate personal information we have about you. We’ll ask you to provide documentation to support the correction and let you know the result.
To access, delete or correct your information, visit our
Choices and Controls page
. California residents can also contact us at (866) 385-3193. Helpful details about the process can be found at
our Data Request Center
, including your option to appeal.
We don’t mind if you make access, deletion or correction requests, or ask us not to sell or share information. These are rights under certain state laws, and we have extended their availability to others across the U.S., regardless of where you live.
As required by California law, you can review information specifically about California requests from the previous calendar year on our
California metrics page
. We also follow state requirements within California regarding
businesses
and
those that provide work for us.
Personalized and Personalized Plus
AT&T has two programs that use your personal information to help customize your experience. For instance, you might be shown an online advertisement that is more relevant to your interests, rather than a general ad.
You can choose to participate or not – and it’s never a problem if you change your mind. You are automatically enrolled in the Personalized program, but you can always opt out. You must opt in to join Personalized Plus. Choices for both programs can be made at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
Here is a comparison of the programs:
*If you live in certain states, we won’t collect, use, store or share your sensitive personal information for marketing and advertising unless you join Personalized Plus. This includes information like ethnicity and racial origin. The states are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.
If you join the Personalized Plus program, it is an extension of the Personalized program, and you will be enrolled in both. Regardless of your selection to participate in either program, you are always in control of the sharing or selling of your personal information, see the “Your privacy choices and controls” section.  And if you choose not to allow the sharing and selling of your personal information, you will be enrolled only in portions of Personalized Plus that don’t sell or share your information externally.
More choices and controls
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI).
CPNI is information related to the telecommunications services you purchase from us, such as which subscription plan you have and details about who you called. Your phone number, name and address are not CPNI. It is your right and our duty under federal law to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.
You can choose whether we use your CPNI internally for marketing – such as helping to offer you new services and promotions.
You can opt out at
att.com/cpni/optout
. You can also call us any time at
(800) 315-8303
and follow the prompts. Or you can talk to a service representative at
(800) 288-2020 (consumer)
or
(800) 321-2000 (business)
.
We don’t share CPNI outside of our AT&T affiliates, agents and suppliers without your consent except for court orders, fraud detection, providing service, network operations and security, aggregate (grouped) information that doesn’t identify you personally and as otherwise authorized by law.
If you choose to restrict our use of CPNI, it won’t affect your services. We keep your choice until you change your mind, which you can do at any time. Keep in mind, even if you restrict use of your CPNI, you may still get marketing from us.
Identity verification.
Non-AT&T companies like your bank may receive limited information from us to help protect your accounts from fraud, verify your identity and make sure it’s really you authorizing a transaction. We do not allow these non-AT&T companies to use your information for any purpose except supporting those services. You are generally enrolled through the non-AT&T company, but you can stop at any time through us. Text “STOP” to 8010 to turn off Identity Verification, or text “RESUME” to restart. Or manage your choices at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
Contact preferences.
We like to tell you about offers and programs that may interest you. You can manage how we do that. Keep in mind that we still may need to contact you with service and non-marketing messages. Please visit
Contact Preferences
for more information and links.
Industry choices and controls
Online behavioral advertising.
You have industry-wide choices about online, interest-based advertising.
Companies including AT&T may use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of websites including ours. This information can be used to analyze and track online activity or deliver ads and content tailored to your interests.
You can opt out of online behavioral advertising from companies that participate in the
Digital Advertising Alliance
. Go to their
Consumer Choice Page
. You can also select this icon
when you see it on an online ad.
You can limit collection of data on websites by
managing cookies and similar technologies
on your computer. Remember that if you change computers, devices, or web browsers, or if you delete cookies, you will need to manage them again.
At AT&T, please note that when we collect web browsing information as an internet service provider, it works independently of your web browser’s cookie and private browsing settings that interact with online behavioral advertising. You can manage AT&T’s use of web browsing information – such as our Personalized Plus program – at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
We don’t currently respond to Do Not Track. Please go to
All About Do Not Track
for more information.
Unless you join our Personalized Plus ad program, we don’t knowingly allow non-AT&T companies to collect your personally identifiable activity on our websites for their own use and tracking.
Close
Data retention and security
We keep your information as long as we need it for business, tax or legal purposes. We set our retention periods based on things like what type of personal information it is, how long it’s needed to operate the business or provide our products and services, and whether it’s subject to contractual or legal obligations. These obligations might be ongoing litigation, mandatory data retention laws or government orders to preserve data for an investigation. After that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or indecipherable.
We work hard to safeguard your information using technology controls and organizational controls. We protect our computer storage and network equipment. We require employees to authenticate themselves to access sensitive data. We limit access to personal information to the people who need access for their jobs. And we require callers and online users to authenticate themselves before we provide account information.
No security measures are perfect. We can’t guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this notice. If a breach occurs, we’ll notify you as required by law.

Close
Information specific to children
We don’t knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 without parental notice, and we get parental consent where appropriate. We also won’t contact a child under 13 for marketing purposes without parental consent. However, if we are not aware that a child is using a service or device purchased by an adult, we may collect the information and treat it as the adult’s. (See
your privacy choices
.)
We don’t have knowledge that we sell the personal information of anyone under 16. If we collect personal information that we know is from anyone under 16, we won’t sell it unless we receive affirmative permission to do so.

are small data files. Websites place them in your browser to recognize your computer

                    or

                    mobile device when you return to that site. Cookies are created to keep track of your movements

                    within

                    the site, help you resume where you

                    left off, remember your registered username, preferences and other customizations.
There are a couple of important things to remember about cookies:
Disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on some websites. You’ll need to

                        perform the opt out procedure if you opt out of a program or service and then change computers

                        or

                        Web browsers, or clear or erase the digital

                        "cookie" that lets us know you opted out.
Local Storage Cookies.
Local Storage is a convenient, flexible, secure and faster way to

                        store HTTP state data. It is a method by which our web pages locally store named key/value pairs

                        in

                        a user’s web browser. Local storage on

                        ATT.com is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from our domains. Local storage

                        data

                        is session-based and will not persist once the session is over and the browser is closed.
Flash Cookies
(also called Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") are similar to cookies, except

                that they can store more complex data. They are used to remember your settings, preferences and usage,

                and

                other similar services. Flash

                cookies allow functionality and availability of certain services. If disabled, these services may not

                function correctly. While browser cookies may be removed or blocked via web browser settings, flash

                cookies

                operate differently. Please note

                that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the

                functionality of some Flash applications. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit

                the
Adobe website
and make changes

                at
Global Storage Settings Panel
.
Web beacons
are small graphic images on a Web page or in an e-mail. They can be used for things

                like

                recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing

                campaign performs.
A
widget
is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. It can provide

                real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports. Widgets are often provided by a third

                party

                and allow them to collect data about

                users viewing that page.
A
server log
records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in

                improving web page performance and introducing new features. For example, it may record which search

                terms

                you’ve entered, or the links you’ve

                clicked on. It may also record your browser information, such as your IP address, device type, how long

                you

                spend on a Web page, and your browser's cookies.
Some websites have “
social network or other third-party plug-ins
.” These plug-ins may provide

                information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in. It may also

                apply

                even if you don’t have an account

                with them. Social networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser.

                This

                might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address and the URL

                of

                the web page where the

                plug-in appears. If you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to

                familiarize

                yourself with their privacy policies.
Managing Cookies
Most browsers will allow you to delete, disable and choose what cookies can be placed on your computer. If

            you

AT&T Consumer Marketing
AT&T will maintain a company-specific (Internal) Do Not Mail (DNM) list of existing and prospective

            residential customers who request not to receive any AT&T marketing materials via US Postal Mail.
Consumers must contact the AT&T residential care center at 1-800-288-2020 and specify each individual

                member of the household and each associated address to be added to the DNM list.
Generally AT&T processes DNM requests within 30 days. However, because our mailings are processed well

                in advance, you may continue to receive additional offers for some time after the request date.'
Please note that AT&T may direct mail market to certain neighborhoods or zip

                        codes. These offerings are delivered to all homes in a neighborhood or zip code. You may continue to

                        receive this type of mailing even if you opt-out of receiving

                        marketing related postal mailings from AT&T.
DNM requests for an individual consumer at a residential address will remain in effect for THREE years from

                the date of request.
AT&T does not accept DNM requests from third party providers.
AT&T DNM requests will expire upon change of address.
AT&T will not share or disclose DNM information with any third party other than AT&T vendors responsible

            for direct mail marketing on AT&T's behalf.
Notifications and other non-solicitation mail pieces are exempt from this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM

            Policy.
AT&T reserves the right to discontinue this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy, and may cease

            accepting DNM requests or otherwise modify this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy.

We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:
We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.

We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:
We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.

.
As of November 1, these additional key changes will take effect for AT&T customers under our revised policy:
We may collect, use or share biometric information for fraud prevention and security purposes.
If you opt in to our Enhanced Relevant Advertising program, we may use other information from testing and
            running our network to make inferences regarding web browsing and videos watched over secure connections to
            personalize your experience or
            deliver more relevant marketing messages and offers to you. Keep in mind that we don’t access sensitive
            information or break encryption, and we don’t use the content of texts, emails or phone calls for marketing
            or advertising.
If we share information with third parties for purposes such as verifying your identity and protecting your
            financial accounts, you can manage this sharing of information simply by going to
Manage Privacy Choices
.
We are committed to keeping your information secure, as well as providing you with Choices and Controls for how
        your information is used. You can visit the
Choices and
            Controls
section of our
Privacy Center
at any time to adjust your
        settings. Your service is not affected by these changes, and your continued use of our services indicates your
        acceptance of these changes.

AT&T Privacy Notice
Thank you for reading our Privacy Notice. Your privacy is important to you and to us. This notice explains how we use your information and keep it safe.
Importantly, it explains the choices you can make at any time about how your information may be used.
This notice applies to AT&T products and services including internet, wireless, voice and AT&T apps. We will tell you if a different notice applies. For example:
Cricket and DIRECTV (including U-verse TV) have their own privacy notices.
AT&T business customers may have a service agreement that covers the handling of information. The service agreement controls if it is different from this Privacy Notice.
For AT&T business customers outside the United States,
the AT&T Business Customer Privacy Notice – Most of World
governs if different from this Privacy Notice.
Please make sure everyone who uses your account knows they are covered by this notice.
The information we collect
To better run our business, we collect information about you, your equipment and how you use our products and services. This can include:
Account information.
You give us information about yourself, such as contact and billing information. We also keep service-related history and details, including
Customer Proprietary Network Information
.
Equipment information.
We collect information about equipment on our network like the type of device you use, device ID, and phone number.
Network performance.
We monitor and test the health and performance of our network. This includes your use of Products and Services to show how our network and your device are working.
Location information.
Location data is automatically generated when devices, products and services interact with cell towers and Wi-Fi routers. Location can also be generated by Bluetooth services, network devices and other tech, including GPS satellites.
Web browsing and app information
. We automatically collect a variety of information which may include time spent on websites or apps, website and IP addresses and advertising IDs. It also can include links and ads seen, videos watched, search terms entered and items placed in online AT&T shopping carts. We may use pixels, cookies and similar tools to collect this information. We don’t decrypt information from secure websites or apps – such as passwords or banking information.
Biometric information.
Fingerprints, voice prints and face scans are examples of biological characteristics that may be used to identify individuals. Learn more in our
Biometric Information Privacy Notice
.
Third-party information.
We get information from outside sources like credit reports, marketing mailing lists and commercially available demographic and geographic data. Social media posts also may be collected, if you reach out to us directly or mention AT&T. Sometimes this data is de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized.
All these types of information are considered Personal Information when they can reasonably be linked to you as an identifiable person or household. For instance, information is personal when it can be linked to your name, account number or device.
Close
How we use your information
We rely on the information we collect to support our business functions, power our services and improve your experience, such as when we:
Combine it with the information from testing and running our network to determine which products and services better meet the needs of our customers.
Provide our products and services.
Contact you.
Improve your experience and safety. This includes verifying your identity, detecting and preventing fraud, protecting your financial accounts, authorizing transactions and assisting your interactions with customer care.
Improve and protect our network.
Use it to help understand which additional products and services may interest you and others. (We don’t access or use the content of your texts, emails or calls for this or any other marketing and advertising.)
Design and deliver advertising, marketing and promotional campaigns to you and others – and measuring their effectiveness (
See your choices
).
Use it for billing, collection, and protection of our property and legal rights.
Prevent and investigate security issues, illegal activities, and violations of our terms and conditions.
De-identify, aggregate, or anonymize it to protect your privacy and security. We don’t try to re-identify this data like attempting to associate it with an individual person except to evaluate the effectiveness of our de-identification policies and procedures.
Conduct research and create aggregated reports – reports that offer insights about groups of customers, but not individuals (we do not attempt to re-identify individuals in aggregated reports).
Close
How we share your information
As described in the following paragraphs, AT&T shares information within our own AT&T companies and affiliates. We also share with non-AT&T companies.
AT&T affiliates.
We share information that identifies you personally with our
affiliates
, such as DIRECTV and Cricket. When we share this information, they must follow this Privacy Notice regarding your info, not just their own policy. This includes the
privacy choices
you make with AT&T.
AT&T affiliates and non-AT&T companies for advertising and marketing.
We may share information with affiliates and other companies to deliver our ads and marketing or to assess their effectiveness. (Learn more about our ad programs and see
your choices
.)
Non-AT&T companies providing a service.
We use suppliers for services like marketing and mailing bills and to support our products. When we share your information with suppliers, we require them to use it only for the intended purpose and to protect it consistent with this notice.
Non-AT&T companies for identity verification.
We share your information to protect you from fraud, authenticate your identity, protect your financial accounts and authorize transactions. When we share with companies like your bank for this purpose, we require them to use it only for the intended purpose and to protect it consistent with this notice. (Learn more and
see your choices
, including your right to decline this service.)
Non-AT&T companies and non-branded affiliates with your consent.
If we have your opt-in consent, we may share your information consistent with your direction.
Non-AT&T companies or entities where authorized or required by law.
This can happen when we:
Comply with court orders, subpoenas, and lawful discovery requests, and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we must comply with legal requirements. You can learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
Detect and prevent fraud.
Provide or obtain information related to payment for your service.
Route your calls or other communications, like connecting calls or text messages with other carrier networks.
Ensure network operations and security, defend against legal claims and enforce our legal rights.
Notify, respond, or provide information (including location) to an appropriate governmental entity in emergency circumstances such as immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.
Alert the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography if we become aware through the provision of our services.
Share the names, addresses and telephone numbers of non-mobile phone customers with phone directory publishers and directory assistance services as required by law. We honor your request for non-published or non-listed numbers.
Provide name and phone number for wireline and wireless Caller ID and related services like Call Trace.
Non-AT&T companies for metrics, insights and research.
We may share aggregated (grouped) data that does not identify you personally for these purposes. We require that companies and entities agree not to attempt to identify individuals – or allow others to do so. We share in this manner for:
Metrics:
Sometimes you enjoy a service from us that directly involves another business. For instance, we might provide the Wi-Fi service at a place you visit. As part of our service, we may provide aggregate metrics reports to that business about how the Wi-Fi is being used, such as aggregated location and web-browsing data. It can only be used for group insights.
Insights:
We may share aggregated data about our network, operations or services.
Research:
We may share information for research. We require the entities to handle the data securely and not reuse or resell it.
Non-AT&T companies for location services.
With your consent, we may share your location information for traffic and mapping apps and other location services to which you subscribe. We share only with your consent unless required by law. Keep in mind:
You may give your consent to us, or you may give it directly to another company – like a medical alerting device company.
If you give it directly to another company, that company governs the use or disclosure of location.
In some cases, such as parental controls, consent may come from the AT&T account holder and not the individual user.
Close
Your privacy choices and controls
You can manage how we use and share your information for certain activities including advertising and marketing. Here are key examples:
Sharing or selling my personal information.
We may share limited information to create, deliver, and measure advertisements for things you might like. This includes targeted advertising, which may be based on personal data obtained from your interactions with other businesses. We also share information in ways that may be considered a sale of information under some state laws, such as exchanging subscriber lists for marketing.
You can ask us to stop at any time, just:
Visit
att.com/PrivacyChoices
or our
Choices and Controls page
page to control if we can share or sell your personal information.
Contact us at (866) 385-3193 if you are a California resident.
We recognize and honor the preference signal associated with a
Global Privacy Control
.
Access, delete and correct your personal information.
You can ask to see what personal information we have about you. You can also ask us to delete or correct it.
Access and Portability.
If you want to see the personal information we’ve collected, you can ask us for it. We will describe the categories of info we collect, the specific pieces we’ve collected, the sources of the information, the purposes for collecting, sharing or selling it and the categories of non-AT&T companies with whom we shared it. You can also ask to “port” your data, which means you get a copy that you can take with you.
Delete.
You can ask us to delete your personal information. In keeping with various state laws, please know that we will still keep data needed for things like running the business, security and fraud protection, compliance with legal obligations and marketing our products and services to our own customers.
Correct.
You can ask us to correct inaccurate personal information we have about you. We’ll ask you to provide documentation to support the correction and let you know the result.
To access, delete or correct your information, visit our
Choices and Controls page
. California residents can also contact us at (866) 385-3193. Helpful details about the process can be found at
our Data Request Center
, including your option to appeal.
We don’t mind if you make access, deletion or correction requests, or ask us not to sell or share information. These are rights under certain state laws, and we have extended their availability to others across the U.S., regardless of where you live.
As required by California law, you can review information specifically about California requests from the previous calendar year on our
California metrics page
. We also follow state requirements within California regarding
businesses
and
those that provide work for us.
Personalized and Personalized Plus
AT&T has two programs that use your personal information to help customize your experience. For instance, you might be shown an online advertisement that is more relevant to your interests, rather than a general ad.
You can choose to participate or not – and it’s never a problem if you change your mind. You are automatically enrolled in the Personalized program, but you can always opt out. You must opt in to join Personalized Plus. Choices for both programs can be made at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
Here is a comparison of the programs:
*If you live in certain states, we won’t collect, use, store or share your sensitive personal information for marketing and advertising unless you join Personalized Plus. This includes information like ethnicity and racial origin. The states are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.
If you join the Personalized Plus program, it is an extension of the Personalized program, and you will be enrolled in both. Regardless of your selection to participate in either program, you are always in control of the sharing or selling of your personal information, see the “Your privacy choices and controls” section.  And if you choose not to allow the sharing and selling of your personal information, you will be enrolled only in portions of Personalized Plus that don’t sell or share your information externally.
More choices and controls
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI).
CPNI is information related to the telecommunications services you purchase from us, such as which subscription plan you have and details about who you called. Your phone number, name and address are not CPNI. It is your right and our duty under federal law to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.
You can choose whether we use your CPNI internally for marketing – such as helping to offer you new services and promotions.
You can opt out at
att.com/cpni/optout
. You can also call us any time at
(800) 315-8303
and follow the prompts. Or you can talk to a service representative at
(800) 288-2020 (consumer)
or
(800) 321-2000 (business)
.
We don’t share CPNI outside of our AT&T affiliates, agents and suppliers without your consent except for court orders, fraud detection, providing service, network operations and security, aggregate (grouped) information that doesn’t identify you personally and as otherwise authorized by law.
If you choose to restrict our use of CPNI, it won’t affect your services. We keep your choice until you change your mind, which you can do at any time. Keep in mind, even if you restrict use of your CPNI, you may still get marketing from us.
Identity verification.
Non-AT&T companies like your bank may receive limited information from us to help protect your accounts from fraud, verify your identity and make sure it’s really you authorizing a transaction. We do not allow these non-AT&T companies to use your information for any purpose except supporting those services. You are generally enrolled through the non-AT&T company, but you can stop at any time through us. Text “STOP” to 8010 to turn off Identity Verification, or text “RESUME” to restart. Or manage your choices at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
Contact preferences.
We like to tell you about offers and programs that may interest you. You can manage how we do that. Keep in mind that we still may need to contact you with service and non-marketing messages. Please visit
Contact Preferences
for more information and links.
Industry choices and controls
Online behavioral advertising.
You have industry-wide choices about online, interest-based advertising.
Companies including AT&T may use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of websites including ours. This information can be used to analyze and track online activity or deliver ads and content tailored to your interests.
You can opt out of online behavioral advertising from companies that participate in the
Digital Advertising Alliance
. Go to their
Consumer Choice Page
. You can also select this icon
when you see it on an online ad.
You can limit collection of data on websites by
managing cookies and similar technologies
on your computer. Remember that if you change computers, devices, or web browsers, or if you delete cookies, you will need to manage them again.
At AT&T, please note that when we collect web browsing information as an internet service provider, it works independently of your web browser’s cookie and private browsing settings that interact with online behavioral advertising. You can manage AT&T’s use of web browsing information – such as our Personalized Plus program – at
att.com/PrivacyChoices
.
We don’t currently respond to Do Not Track. Please go to
All About Do Not Track
for more information.
Unless you join our Personalized Plus ad program, we don’t knowingly allow non-AT&T companies to collect your personally identifiable activity on our websites for their own use and tracking.
Close
Data retention and security
We keep your information as long as we need it for business, tax or legal purposes. We set our retention periods based on things like what type of personal information it is, how long it’s needed to operate the business or provide our products and services, and whether it’s subject to contractual or legal obligations. These obligations might be ongoing litigation, mandatory data retention laws or government orders to preserve data for an investigation. After that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or indecipherable.
We work hard to safeguard your information using technology controls and organizational controls. We protect our computer storage and network equipment. We require employees to authenticate themselves to access sensitive data. We limit access to personal information to the people who need access for their jobs. And we require callers and online users to authenticate themselves before we provide account information.
No security measures are perfect. We can’t guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this notice. If a breach occurs, we’ll notify you as required by law.

Close
Information specific to children
We don’t knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 without parental notice, and we get parental consent where appropriate. We also won’t contact a child under 13 for marketing purposes without parental consent. However, if we are not aware that a child is using a service or device purchased by an adult, we may collect the information and treat it as the adult’s. (See
your privacy choices
.)
We don’t have knowledge that we sell the personal information of anyone under 16. If we collect personal information that we know is from anyone under 16, we won’t sell it unless we receive affirmative permission to do so.

Web beacons
are small graphic images on a Web page or in an e-mail. They can be used for things

                like

                recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing

                campaign performs.
A
widget
is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. It can provide

                real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports. Widgets are often provided by a third

                party

                and allow them to collect data about

                users viewing that page.
A
server log
records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in

                improving web page performance and introducing new features. For example, it may record which search

                terms

                you’ve entered, or the links you’ve

                clicked on. It may also record your browser information, such as your IP address, device type, how long

                you

                spend on a Web page, and your browser's cookies.
Some websites have “
social network or other third-party plug-ins
.” These plug-ins may provide

                information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in. It may also

                apply

                even if you don’t have an account

                with them. Social networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser.

                This

                might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address and the URL

                of

                the web page where the

                plug-in appears. If you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to

                familiarize

                yourself with their privacy policies.

AT&T Consumer Marketing
AT&T will maintain a company-specific (Internal) Do Not Mail (DNM) list of existing and prospective

            residential customers who request not to receive any AT&T marketing materials via US Postal Mail.
Consumers must contact the AT&T residential care center at 1-800-288-2020 and specify each individual

                member of the household and each associated address to be added to the DNM list.
Generally AT&T processes DNM requests within 30 days. However, because our mailings are processed well

                in advance, you may continue to receive additional offers for some time after the request date.'
Please note that AT&T may direct mail market to certain neighborhoods or zip

                        codes. These offerings are delivered to all homes in a neighborhood or zip code. You may continue to

                        receive this type of mailing even if you opt-out of receiving

                        marketing related postal mailings from AT&T.
DNM requests for an individual consumer at a residential address will remain in effect for THREE years from

                the date of request.
AT&T does not accept DNM requests from third party providers.
AT&T DNM requests will expire upon change of address.
AT&T will not share or disclose DNM information with any third party other than AT&T vendors responsible

            for direct mail marketing on AT&T's behalf.
Notifications and other non-solicitation mail pieces are exempt from this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM

            Policy.
AT&T reserves the right to discontinue this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy, and may cease

            accepting DNM requests or otherwise modify this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy.

We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:
We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.

AT&T may disclose Personal Data if AT&T determines it is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or to protect or defend AT&T’s rights, property, or employees.

Where is Personal Data about Customer Data Subjects Processed?
AT&T is a multinational company, but has centralized business and operational activities to better manage a global business. That centralization may result in the transfer of Personal Data to, or access to Personal Data from, countries outside of the country in which the Customer Data Subject is located. The principal countries to which Personal Data is transferred include the United States of America, Brazil, Czech Republic, India, Malaysia, Poland, Philippines, Mexico, Singapore, and Slovakia. In some of these countries, the Data Privacy Laws may offer a lower standard of protection than the country in which the Customer Data Subject is located. As applicable, AT&T takes appropriate technical, organizational, and contractual steps to conduct cross border transfers of Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of the more stringent Data Privacy Laws in order to safeguard Personal Data as set out in this Notice.
AT&T generally transfers Personal Data about Customer Data Subjects between AT&T affiliates on the basis of our Intra-Group Agreement (IGA), which includes standard contractual clauses for export of Personal Data to third countries. AT&T may additionally rely on other lawful bases for transfer of Personal Data. A Customer Data Subject may request to review the safeguards AT&T uses for cross border transfers by contacting the AT&T Chief Privacy Office at
AskPrivacy@att.com.
Wherever Personal Data is Processed, AT&T uses appropriate security measures consistent with Data Privacy Laws.
Close
When is Personal Data about Customer Data Subjects deleted?
Personal Data will be retained as needed for business administration, tax, or legal purposes and as consistent with Data Privacy Laws. In many cases, this will require retention through the administrative period of the contract between AT&T and the AT&T Business Customer, or through the period of the relationship between the AT&T Business Customer and the Customer Data Subject. After that, Personal Data will be destroyed by making it unreadable or undecipherable. While Personal Data is retained, AT&T implements appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to secure Personal Data. Such measures may include:
Maintaining and protecting the security of computer storage and network equipment and using security procedures that require usernames and passwords to access data;
Applying encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect Personal Data when stored or transmitted;
Limiting access to Personal Data to only those with jobs requiring such access; and
Requiring AT&T personnel involved in the Processing of Personal Data to complete training and awareness programs on the requirements of Data Privacy Laws.
Close
What rights do Customer Data Subjects have to manage Processing of Personal Data?
The Customer Data Subject has certain rights under certain circumstances regarding Processing of Personal Data. AT&T is committed to honoring these rights and has established effective and transparent policies and procedures to do so. A Customer Data Subject’s rights with respect to his or her own Personal Data may include:
Right to Notice.
AT&T provides this Notice detailing how Personal Data is Processed.
Right to Access.
A Customer Data Subject may obtain confirmation of whether Personal Data is being Processed and, if it is, access the Personal Data and additional information about the Processing of that data.
Right to Revoke Consent.
A Customer Data Subject may withdraw a given consent at any time and AT&T will stop Processing and delete the Customer Data Subject’s Personal Data, subject to AT&T’s right to retain the data as allowed for lawful purposes, including to comply with its legal obligations and to use on an anonymized basis
Right to Rectification.
A Customer Data Subject may have inaccurate Personal Data corrected and have incomplete Personal Data made complete.
Right to Erasure.
A Customer Data Subject may have Personal Data erased, in certain circumstances.
Right to Restriction of Processing.
A Customer Data Subject may have additional Processing of Personal Data temporarily prohibited while the accuracy or Processing of Personal Data is contested.
Right to Data Portability.
A Customer Data Subject may be able to have Personal Data provided to another Data Controller, either by the Customer Data Subject or directly by AT&T.
Right to Object.
A Customer Data Subject may object, at any time and on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to Processing of Personal Data.
Right to Avoid Automated Individual Decision-Making.
AT&T’s Processing of Personal Data generally does not include automated decision-making that produces legal effects concerning the Customer Data Subject. In the event AT&T implements such automated-decision making, AT&T will provide meaningful information about the logic involved and the significance and the envisaged consequences of such Processing for the Customer Data Subject.
Whether, how, and to what extent a specific right applies and how it will be addressed by AT&T will depend upon the applicable Data Privacy Law, the lawful basis pursuant to which Personal Data is Processed, the nature of the Personal Data, and AT&T’s ability to determine that it holds responsive Personal Data. As the Personal Data is Processed as part of AT&T’s contractual obligations to the AT&T Business Customer, for applicability and authentication purposes AT&T will coordinate responses to requests of Customer Data Subjects with the AT&T Business Customer. The Customer Data Subject should directly contact the AT&T Business Customer to initiate a rights request. AT&T's Business customers should submit requests on behalf of users by emailing their AT&T account manager or AT&T Service Management contact. Please copy
BusinessDataRequests@amcustomercare.att-mail.com
on the email. AT&T will work with the AT&T Business Customer to determine the appropriate response to a request. Provision of Personal Data in response to a Customer Data Subject’s request shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
Close
Additional Information
Questions about this Notice may be sent to AT&T Chief Privacy Office at
AskPrivacy@att.com
or to AT&T’s country and regional data protection officers (DPOs) at this
email address
. Please include “Customer Data Subject Question” in the email’s subject line. A Customer Data Subject may file a complaint with the relevant data protection regulator or national authority. The relevant national authority would likely be, but is not necessarily limited to, the one established in the country in which the Customer Data Subject is located. A Customer Data Subject may additionally or alternatively seek judicial redress for alleged infringements of applicable law by AT&T.

We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:
We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.

Previous Version
Your information and your privacy are important – to you and to us. This policy explains how we use your information and how we keep it safe. Importantly, it explains the choices you can make at any time about how your information is used. Below links can be used to go directly to the different policy sections.

When this Policy Applies
This Cricket Wireless Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers the information generated when you use or subscribe to Cricket Wireless products, services, apps, websites or networks to which this Policy is linked. In the Policy, we call them “Products or Services” for short. They include voice, data, mobile broadband and other products, services, and apps.
This Policy applies to you and anyone who uses our Products or Services under your account, except where we identify that separate Cricket or affiliate privacy policies or terms, and conditions apply.  You are responsible for making sure all users under your account understand and agree to this Policy.
Here are special circumstances where this Policy may not apply, or may apply in addition to other policies:
Some of our affiliates – such as AT&T companies – have their own privacy policies that apply to data they collect from products, services, and apps they provide.  Any data collected subject to this Policy that is shared with those affiliates will still be treated consistent with this Policy.
Some areas both inside and outside of the United States - for example California and the European Union - require us to adopt different policy terms and commitments in accordance with local laws.
In certain cases, when you’re using your Cricket Products or Services, other companies may be collecting information, so your information may be covered by this Policy and other privacy policies at the same time. Here are some examples: if you purchase one of our Products or Services from a retailer; if you use our services to connect to a social networking service or another company’s Wi-Fi network; or if you provide your information to another company through a co-branded website, app or service controlled by the other company. In those cases, any information you provide to those companies may be subject to just their policy, or subject to both their policy and ours.
If you are a Cricket business customer, we may have written Product or Service agreements that contain specific provisions about confidentiality, security or handling of information. When one of those agreements differs from or conflicts with this Policy, the terms of those agreements will apply instead. In all other instances, the terms of this Policy apply.
The Information we Collect
We collect information about you and how you’re using our Products or Services along with information about your devices and equipment. This may include performance information, along with web browsing and location information.
Here are detailed examples of types of information we collect from our Products or Services:
Account information includes things like contact and payment information, service-related details and history and similar information, including
Customer Proprietary Network Information
. It also includes technical, equipment and usage information that relate to the services, products, websites, and networks we provide you.
Web browsing and app information includes things like the websites you visit or mobile apps you use, on or off our network.  It includes internet protocol addresses and URLs, pixels, cookies and similar technologies, and identifiers such as advertising IDs and device IDs. It can also include information about the time you spend on websites or apps, the links or advertisements you see, search terms you enter, items identified in your online shopping carts and other similar information.
Equipment Information includes information that identifies or relates to equipment on our networks, such as type, identifier, status, settings, configuration, software or use.
Network performance and usage information includes information about our networks, including your use of Products or Services or equipment on the networks, and how they are performing.
Location information includes your street address, your ZIP code and where your device is located. Location information is generated when the devices, Products or Services you use interact with cell towers, Wi-Fi routers, Bluetooth services, access points, other devices, beacons and/or with other technologies, including GPS satellites.
How We Collect Your Information
We collect your information in 3 ways:
You give it to us when you make a purchase, set up an account or otherwise directly communicate with us.
We automatically get it when you use, or your device uses, our Products or Services. For example, we use network tools to collect information like call and text records and the web browsing information we describe in this Policy.
We get it from outside sources like credit information, marketing mailing lists and commercially available geographic and demographic information, along with other available information, such as public posts to social networking sites.
How We Use Your Information
We use your information to power our services and to improve your experiences. We use your information to provide, support, improve, protect, analyze, and bill for our products, service, and network; to communicate with you about your service, products or apps; to market our services; to detect and avoid fraud; for advertising; and for research purposes.
Here are examples of ways we use your information:
Providing our Products and Services.
Contacting you.
Improving your experience and protecting the Products and Services we offer. This includes things like customer care, network security, verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting and preventing fraud, billing, authorizing transactions and the development of future Products and Services.
Helping us plan, deploy, improve, protect, and defend our network infrastructure, protecting our property and legal rights, and for other lawful purposes.
Understanding the Products, Services and offers that you, and other Cricket customers with whom you call and text and interact, might enjoy the most.  We do not use the content of your texts, emails, or calls for marketing or advertising.
Creating engaging and customized experiences and offering new or improved Products and Services or offers. This is based on things like the information we’ve collected and our research, development, and analysis.
Designing and delivering advertising and marketing campaigns to you and others and measuring their effectiveness.  See
Your Privacy Choices and Controls
for more information about how your information is used for advertising and marketing programs and your choices and controls for such use.
Delivering or customizing products and the content you see, including advertisements, articles, videos, and marketing materials.
Creating aggregate business and marketing insights, and helping companies develop aggregate insights (for instance, to market or improve Products and Services). We aggregate the data before we share it, which means that we group the information so that it does not identify you personally, and we require anyone who receives this data to agree they will only use it for aggregate insights, won’t attempt to identify any person or device using this information, and will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.
For security purposes, including preventing and investigating illegal activities and violations of our Terms, Use Policies and other service conditions or restrictions.
How We Share Your Information
We share it with your permission.
We share it across affiliate companies.
We share it with non-affiliate companies or entities as explained in this Policy. For more details about how your information may be shared for advertising and marketing see
Your Privacy Choices and Controls
.
Sharing information across the affiliates: Cricket is an AT&T company, and we share your information with AT&T and other companies in the AT&T family for a variety of purposes, including the marketing of Products and Services to you. Cricket already offers you certain choices and controls about Marketing and Advertising. Our affiliates are required to honor your choices and controls elections in order to use information they may receive from Cricket for their advertising or marketing purposes. If you are also an AT&T customer, making a choice per this Policy will not change any existing choices you may have made separately with AT&T.  For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share, and protect the information consistent with this Policy including honoring your communications preferences for first-party marketing of their products and services, your advertising consents and your State Data Rights and Choices.  We may also combine information from your Cricket Products or Services that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.
Sharing information with non-affiliated companies that provide services for us or for you: We share information that identifies you personally with vendors that perform services for us or that support Products or Services provided to you, including marketing or ad delivery services. We do not require consent for sharing with our vendors for these purposes.  We do not allow those vendors to use your information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy.
Sharing information with non-affiliated companies to enable Identity Verification to you: We may share information with non-affiliated companies for their purposes to provide you services such as verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting fraud, protecting your financial accounts, and authorizing transactions. We do not allow those non-affiliated companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy. You are in control of this sharing and can opt out by texting “STOP” to 8010 or text “RESUME” to restart sharing at any time.
Sharing information with other non-affiliated companies or entities: There are also times when we provide information that identifies you personally to other companies and entities, such as government agencies, without your consent, but where authorized or required by law. Reasons to share include:
Complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies, as well as parties to civil lawsuits.  You can find out more about this in our
Transparency Report
.
Detecting and preventing fraud.
Providing or obtaining payment for your service.
Routing your calls or other communications.
Ensuring network operations and security.
Notifying, responding, or providing information (including location) to a responsible governmental entity in emergency circumstances such as immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.
Alerting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our services.
Enforcing our legal rights, protecting our network and property, or defending against legal claims.
Providing name and number information for wireless caller ID and related services. This means a person receiving a call can see the name and number of the caller.
Sharing Aggregate Metrics Reports with non-affiliated companies: Sometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. For example, we or our affiliates may collect information, including location and web browsing data, from visitors to places where we or our affiliates provide Wi-Fi services. In such cases, we aggregate the data before we use or share it with our business customers and service suppliers, which means that we group the information so that it does not identify you personally. We require that these metrics reports only be used for aggregate insights and no one will attempt to identify any person or device using this information. Consistent with this Policy, we also require that our metrics reports be handled in a secure manner and that the information included be used only to develop aggregate insights to enable the marketing or improvement of products and services.
Sharing Aggregate Insights: We may share insights with non-Cricket companies about Cricket’s operations, network or services derived from aggregated customer data (data grouped so as not to identify you personally).
Sharing information for research: We may share information that doesn’t identify you personally with other companies and entities for research.  When we share this information, we require companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to use it to identify individuals.  Our agreements will also prevent businesses from reusing or reselling the information and require that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.
Sharing information with affiliates and non-affiliate companies for advertising and marketing programs: We may share information with affiliates and with non-affiliate companies to deliver or assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns as described in the Your Privacy Choices and Controls section.
Sharing information to support location services:  Location services rely on, use or incorporate the location of a device to provide or enhance the service. Location services may collect and use or share location information to power applications on your device (those that are pre-loaded or those that you chose to download), such as mapping and traffic apps, or other location services you subscribe to.  Cricket will not share your location information for location services without your consent (to us or a company providing you service), except as required by law.  If you purchase location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device company, the use or disclosure of location information is governed by the agreement between you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the service provider, and is not governed by this Policy
.
In other cases – for example parental controls services - the account holder for the location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the location services and provide the required consent.
Your Privacy Choices and Controls
You can manage your privacy choices about how we contact you and how we use or share your information. You also have choices about how certain non-Cricket companies and advertisers use your information, including how we use and share your information for advertising and marketing.

Choices about how we use and share your information for advertising and marketing
You have choices about how your information is used or shared in our programs that provide you with marketing and advertising tailored to your interests and for aggregate analytics.  As your provider of communications and internet services, our collection and use of information operates independently in many cases from the user controls and settings on your device, through your operating system, or on non-Cricket company websites or apps.
Online behavioral advertising: Online behavioral advertising is automated, customized advertising that you see when using online services, like ads in mobile apps or on websites. Those ads are served to you based on inferences about your interests.  Those interests are determined from data collected about you, whether by Cricket or other parties.
We work with ad companies that may serve ads, across your use of online services. These companies may use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our websites and apps and other websites and apps. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track online activities and deliver ads and content tailored to your interests as part of our advertising programs.
You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising from companies who participate in the
Digital Advertising Alliance
by going to their
Consumer Choice Page
or selecting this icon when you see it on an online ad.

for more information.
Personalized: Personalized uses information to deliver ads that we think you might be interested in on websites, apps and other properties, sites, or services.
Personalized:  This program gives you the benefit of offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. To determine your possible interests, we use data about your use of our products and services. We also use data we get from our advertising partners, and demographic data like ZIP code and age range. You won't see more ads – just customized ads. The Personalized program does not use your precise location, web browsing data collected as an internet service provider, information about your medical conditions, financial account information or Customer Proprietary Network Information. It also does not access or use the contents of your texts, emails or calls.
The Personalized program may place you into general categories of interest, such as “soccer fan.”  When you participate in this program, we will also:
Use automated decision-making, such as artificial intelligence, for things like marketing and advertising.
Use some types of your Sensitive Personal Information, like your ethnic or racial origin, for things like marketing and advertising, except as noted above.
You can choose to participate or not. You are automatically enrolled in the Personalized program, but you can always opt out. Choices can be made at
Limit the Use of My Personal Information
. If you live in certain states, we won’t collect, use, store or share your sensitive personal information for marketing and advertising. This includes information like ethnicity and racial origin. The states are Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.
Other Choices
Customer Proprietary Network Information: You can
opt-out
or go to
Customer Choices and Controls
for more information about Customer Proprietary Network Information and your choices about our use of that information for marketing purposes.
Identity Verification: We may share information with non-Cricket companies such as your bank to help protect your accounts from fraud, verify your identity and make sure you authorize certain transactions. We do not allow those non-Cricket companies to use your information for any other purpose than those services.  You are enrolled by default, but you can stop at any time.  Text “STOP” to 8010 to turn off Identity Verification or “RESUME” to restart.
Cricket Call Defense:  Cricket Call Defense is enabled on your line if you have an HD Voice capable device.  This product helps to automatically block potential fraud calls and will notify you of suspected spam calls if you are in an HD Voice coverage area. You can opt-out of this service by logging into My Account online or the myCricket app to disable Cricket Call Defense in your settings.
Security
We work hard to safeguard your data using a range of technological and organizational security controls.
We maintain and protect the security of computer storage and network equipment, and we use security procedures that require employees to authenticate themselves to access sensitive data. We also limit access to personal information only to those with jobs requiring such access. We require callers and online users to authenticate themselves before providing account information.
No security measures are perfect, however. We can’t guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy.  If a breach were to occur, we will notify you as required by applicable law.
Data storage, transfer, retention, and accuracy
We take steps to ensure that data is processed according to this Policy and to the requirements of applicable law of your country and of the additional countries where the data is subsequently processed.
Data we collect may be processed and stored in the United States or in other countries where we or our affiliates or service providers process data.
When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other countries, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to help ensure all applicable laws, rights and regulations continue to protect your data.
We keep your information as long as we need it for business, tax or legal purposes. We set our retention periods based on things like the type of personal information collected, how long the personal information is needed to operate the business or provide our Products and Services and whether the business is subject to contractual or legal obligations – such as ongoing litigation, mandatory data retention laws or government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation.  After that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or indecipherable.
Need to update your information? We’re happy to help you review and correct the information we have on your account records. For more information, please see the
Contact Us
section of this Policy.

Privacy notice
The FirstNet.com website is powered by AT&T
Privacy information for FirstNet users
July 1, 2024
AT&T’s FirstNet service is made available for first responders around the country at all levels of government and local organizations and other public safety entities who answer the call when emergencies arise. The First Responder Network Authority (“FirstNet Authority”) is an independent authority within the U.S. Department of Commerce. Its mission is to develop, build and operate the nationwide, broadband network that equips first responders to help save lives and protect communities. AT&T provides services pursuant to a contract with the FirstNet Authority to maintain a single, nationwide, interoperable communications network dedicated when needed to public safety communications.
When you use FirstNet services you are considered a non-consumer customer of AT&T and are subject to AT&T’s Privacy Notice as incorporated in and modified by this document. We do things a little differently for the FirstNet service and it is important that you read and understand the general
AT&T Privacy Notice
and the overriding exceptions and special provisions below:
What is the FirstNet service?
The FirstNet service is provided by AT&T on behalf of the FirstNet Authority. The FirstNet service includes wireless voice, text and data service plans specifically for first responders and other public safety users, provided via a special, National Public Safety Broadband Network (the “FirstNet Network”).
Who are FirstNet users?
FirstNet users are first responders and other public safety users who have enrolled in FirstNet services, either individually or through the agency or organization for which they work or with which they are associated. If you are a FirstNet user who has subscribed individually to the FirstNet service (such as someone using a personal phone instead of a phone supplied by your employer to access the FirstNet service) you are still considered a non-consumer customer. The entire AT&T Privacy Notice applies for services other than FirstNet service that you use.
How are AT&T’s practices different for FirstNet users?
While the AT&T Privacy Notice generally governs FirstNet users, some things are different:
Sharing your information
– The FirstNet Authority and FirstNet subscribing agencies and organizations, including yours, will have access to your information to, among other things, manage priority levels during emergencies and to review AT&T compliance with its FirstNet contract. They will have access to your name, title, device identifier, telephone number, location, and other information about your device and your use of FirstNet Services. By using FirstNet Services, you consent to the collection and disclosure of this and other information.
Sharing reports with the Government and Public Safety entities
– AT&T may share your information in de-identified or aggregate format with the FirstNet Authority and certain other public safety entities. These reports may be provided as part of our contractual obligations for providing FirstNet Services.
Marketing, advertising, and external marketing and analytics reports
– AT&T will not use FirstNet user information for any marketing or advertising purposes other than to market FirstNet apps, services, and supporting devices. Nor will AT&T use FirstNet user information to create External Marketing & Analytics Reports, as described in the AT&T Privacy Notice. However, if you are an individual subscriber to FirstNet, AT&T may use the fact that you are a FirstNet subscriber (but not any other information about you or your FirstNet services) to qualify you for certain offers on AT&T’s consumer products. We obtain information from other sources, like credit agencies, marketing companies, and other service providers.
FirstNet apps and other services

applicable terms of use for AT&T’s websites
.

.
We may request additional information, such as your name, email address, or mailing address, to enroll in a specific service or forum. The relevant grant of consent will be specific. This information, collectively or individually, is referred to as “Personal Data” throughout this Notice.
Close
Why does AT&T process personal data about you?
Personal Data will be used to provide the AT&T websites you are seeking to access. AT&T Processes Personal Data pursuant to established and appropriate lawful bases for processing. These are:
Processing for one or more specific purposes for which you have given consent.
Your consent authorizes us to Process your Personal Data for a specific AT&T web service, including the use of cookies. You may withdraw your consent at any time, but this will impact our ability to provide you with the service or further related information.
Processing necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by AT&T.
AT&T has certain legitimate and lawful interests in Processing Personal Data; these could include Processing for website functionality, administrative purposes, personal and network security, and other compatible purposes.
Throughout this Notice, “Processing” (and all variants) means any operation(s) performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Close
Who has access to personal data about you?
Personal Data may be disclosed, to the extent required for the above purposes, to appropriate and authorized recipients. Recipients may include AT&T affiliates and personnel; business partners and third-party service providers, suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors; and/or other third parties performing services for any of the AT&T companies. Third parties may also collect and Process Personal Data on AT&T’s behalf for the above purposes.
A list of AT&T affiliates and the countries in which they are located may be accessed at this link
.
Third parties given access to Personal Data will be required to use appropriate security measures consistent with legal requirements when Processing Personal Data. Where the third party is Processing such Personal Data on behalf of AT&T, the third party is obligated to do so only pursuant to AT&T’s instructions.
AT&T may disclose Personal Data if compelled to do so by a court of law, regulators, law enforcement agencies, governmental agencies and parties to civil lawsuits in connection with inquiries, proceedings, investigations or lawfully requested to do so by a relevant governmental authority using the appropriate means of request. These parties may be located anywhere in the world.  Prior to any such disclosure, AT&T examines all such requests to determine that they are legally valid, appropriate and proportionate; and AT&T may challenge such requests if it determines that these criteria are not met. AT&T may disclose Personal Data if AT&T determines it is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or to protect or defend AT&T’s rights, property, or employees.
Close
Where is personal data about you processed?
AT&T is a multinational company, but has centralized business and operational activities to better manage a global business. That centralization may result in the transfer of Personal Data to, or access to Personal Data from, countries outside of the country in which you are located. The principal countries to which Personal Data is transferred include the United States of America, Brazil, Czech Republic, India, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore, and Slovakia. In some of these countries, the applicable data privacy laws may offer a lower standard of protection than the country in which you are located. As applicable, AT&T takes appropriate technical, organizational, and contractual steps to conduct cross border transfers of Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of the more stringent applicable data privacy law in order to safeguard Personal Data as set out in this Notice.
AT&T generally transfers Personal Data between AT&T affiliates on the basis of our Intra-Group Agreement (IGA), which includes standard contractual clauses for export of Personal Data to third countries. AT&T may additionally rely on other lawful bases for transfer of Personal Data. You may request to review the safeguards AT&T uses for cross border transfers by contacting the AT&T Chief Privacy Office at
AskPrivacy@att.com
.
Wherever Personal Data is Processed, AT&T uses appropriate security measures consistent with applicable data privacy laws.
Close
When is personal data about you deleted?
Personal data will generally be retained as needed for business administration, tax, or legal purposes and as consistent with applicable data privacy laws. After that, Personal Data will be destroyed by making it unreadable or undecipherable. While Personal Data is retained, AT&T implements appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to secure Personal Data. Such measures may include:
Maintaining and protecting the security of computer storage and network equipment and using security procedures that require usernames and passwords to access data;
Applying encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect Personal Data when stored or transmitted;
Limiting access to Personal Data to only those with jobs requiring such access; and
Requiring AT&T personnel involved in the Processing of Personal Data to complete training and awareness programs on the requirements of applicable data privacy laws.
Close
How may you manage processing of personal data?
You have certain rights regarding Processing of Personal Data. AT&T is committed to honoring these rights and has established clear and accessible policies and procedures. Your rights with respect to your own Personal Data may include:
Right to Notice.
AT&T provides this
AT&T Website User Privacy Notice  - Most of World

Right of Access.
You may obtain confirmation from AT&T as to whether or not Personal Data concerning you is being Processed and, if it is, access to the Personal Data and additional information about the Processing of that data.

Right to Avoid Automated Individual Decision-Making.

Whether and how a right applies will depend on the lawful basis pursuant to which Personal Data is Processed, the nature of the Personal Data requested, and AT&T's ability to determine if we hold responsive Personal Data.

Cookies and Other Technologies
Definitions
Let's start with what we mean when we use the word "cookie" and other related terms:
Cookies
are small data files. Websites place them in your browser to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to that site. Cookies are created to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume where you left off, remember your registered username, preferences and other customizations.
There are a couple of important things to remember about cookies:
Disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on some websites. You’ll need to perform the opt out procedure if you opt out of a program or service and then change computers or Web browsers, or clear or erase the digital "cookie" that lets us know you opted out.
Local Storage Cookies.
Local Storage is a convenient, flexible, secure and faster way to store HTTP state data. It is a method by which our web pages locally store named key/value pairs in a user’s web browser. Local storage on ATT.com is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from our domains. Local storage data is session-based and will not persist once the session is over and the browser is closed.
Flash Cookies
(also called Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") are similar to cookies, except that they can store more complex data. They are used to remember your settings, preferences and usage, and other similar services. Flash cookies allow functionality and availability of certain services. If disabled, these services may not function correctly. While browser cookies may be removed or blocked via web browser settings, flash cookies operate differently. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the
Adobe website
and make changes at
Global Storage Settings Panel
.
Web beacons
are small graphic images on a Web page or in an e-mail. They can be used for things like recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing campaign performs.
A
widget
is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. It can provide real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports. Widgets are often provided by a third party and allow them to collect data about users viewing that page.
A
server log
records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in improving web page performance and introducing new features. For example, it may record which search terms you’ve entered, or the links you’ve clicked on. It may also record your browser information, such as your IP address, device type, how long you spend on a Web page, and your browser's cookies.
Some websites have “
social network or other third-party plug-ins
.” These plug-ins may provide information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in. It may also apply even if you don’t have an account with them. Social networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser. This might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address and the URL of the web page where the plug-in appears. If you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies.

We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:
We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.

We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:
We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.

Biometric information privacy notice
Biometrics are unique biological characteristics that identify you. These include things like fingerprints, voiceprints and scans of your facial geometry. We may collect and use biometrics for verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting and preventing fraud or safety and other security purposes. We only keep biometric information until the initial purpose of collecting it is complete or within one year of your last interaction with AT&T, whichever occurs first, unless we are legally required to keep it for a different period.  After that, we permanently destroy it.
If you have questions about this biometric information notice and how it applies, contact

AT&T Event Guest Privacy Notice
May 2024
AT&T hosts events to discuss critical issues, collaborate with stakeholders, conduct training, and raise awareness of products and services. Personal Data must be Processed to support participation at these AT&T Events. This AT&T Event Guest Privacy Notice (the “Notice”) provides information about the Processing of Personal Data that is consistent at each AT&T Event. There will also be a privacy notice for each AT&T Event to provide the additional and detailed terms of AT&T’s Processing of Personal Data for that specific AT&T Event.
In connection with your participation at an AT&T Event, the Notice outlines:
Who is covered by the Notice?
What Personal Data about you does AT&T Process?
Why does AT&T Process Personal Data about you?
Who has access to Personal Data about you?
Where is Personal Data about you Processed?
When is Personal Data about you deleted?
How may you manage the Processing of Personal Data?
Who is covered by the Notice?
The Notice applies to individuals invited to attend an AT&T Event. It informs guests about how AT&T Processes Personal Data to register you for, and to enable your participation at, an AT&T Event. The Notice also applies to employees and contractors of AT&T, but only as to the Personal Data Processed to register your for at AT&T Event.
Throughout the Notice, “AT&T” includes our affiliated companies and third parties acting on our behalf in support of an event.
What Personal Data about you does AT&T Process?
The Personal Data you will be required to provide will be listed in the AT&T Event-specific notice. This may include your name, email address, or phone number, as well as information such as dietary restrictions, travel details, or emergency contact information. This information is referred to as “Personal Data” throughout the Notice. If Sensitive Personal Data is needed for an event, we will specifically note that and ask for additional consent.
Why does AT&T Process Personal Data about you?
Throughout the Notice, “Process” or “Processing” means any activities performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data. This includes collection, storage, use, dissemination, and deletion.
Personal Data will be used to register you for and facilitate your participation at an AT&T Event.
Personal Data will be Processed:
For one or more specific purposes for which you have given consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time, but this may impact on our ability to provide you with further information.
As necessary for legitimate interests pursued by AT&T. This includes Processing for internal administrative purposes, personal and network security, and other purposes such as sending you future invitations.
Who has access to Personal Data about you?
Personal Data will be disclosed as required for stated purposes and to authorized recipients only. Recipients may include AT&T affiliates and personnel, business partners, third-party service providers, suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors. Third parties may also collect and Process Personal Data on AT&T’s behalf for the above purposes. Third parties given access to Personal Data are required to use appropriate security measures. Third parties are obligated to Processing Personal Data only pursuant to AT&T’s instructions.
AT&T may disclose Personal Data if compelled to do so by a court of law, regulators, law enforcement agencies, governmental agencies, and parties to civil lawsuits. Prior to any disclosure, AT&T examines the demand to determine whether it is legally valid, appropriate, and proportionate. AT&T may challenge such requests if these criteria are not met. AT&T may disclose Personal Data if necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or to protect or defend AT&T’s rights, property, or employees.
Where is Personal Data about you Processed?
AT&T is a multinational company but has centralized business and operational activities to better manage a global business. That centralization may result in the transfer of Personal Data to countries other than the country in which you are located. The principal countries to which Personal Data is transferred include the United States of America, Brazil, Czech Republic, India, Malaysia, Poland, Philippines, Mexico, Singapore, and Slovakia.
When AT&T transfers Personal Data between AT&T affiliates it does so based on our Intra-Group Agreement (IGA). The IGA includes standard contractual clauses for the export of Personal Data to third countries. You may review the safeguards AT&T uses for cross-border transfers by contacting the AT&T Chief Privacy Office at
AskPrivacy@att.com
.
Wherever Personal Data is Processed, AT&T uses appropriate security measures consistent with privacy and data protection laws.

We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:
We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.
