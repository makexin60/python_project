Last updated: 27.05.2024
Omio Corp., a Delaware corporation with its operational headquarters located at Warschauer Platz 12,
                10245 Berlin, Germany, together with its subsidiaries and corporate affiliates (“we,” “us,” “our,” or
                “Omio”) respect your right to privacy and we take our responsibility to safeguard your
                private information very seriously. Omio Corp. is the operator of the Omio websites
                (collectively, our “Service Sites”) and the Omio mobile applications (collectively, the
                “App”), is the data ‘controller,’ as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). You can
                contact us at
info@omio.com
and our data protection officer at
privacy@omio.com
. If the Service Sites or the App connect you
                with third-party online services, you should carefully review the privacy policies of such third-party
                sites as they are not governed by our privacy policy.
We want to inform you about the way we collect and process your personal data in accordance with the GDPR
                and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).
I. What kind of data do we collect?
1. Automatically generated website visitor information
We collect information and data that is automatically transmitted or generated by your browser each time
                you visit our website. Such information includes the IP address, the URLs of the site you visited before
                accessing our Service Sites (“referrer”), the browser used, the browser language, the operating system
                and user interface, the access device used, date and time of your access, the pages viewed on our
                website, and the time you spend on the Service Sites. Such data is stored for a period of two years and
                deleted automatically thereafter. We may use this information to investigate errors, to improve the
                stability and functionality of the Service Sites and the App, and to assist you in completing any
                interrupted bookings.
2. Data provided by you / user accounts
Furthermore, we also collect and use the information you provide to us about yourself, your travel
                companions, and about the planning of your trip by using the Service Sites or the App:
a) When you book a travel product through our Service Sites, we ask you to provide personal data, e.g.
                your name, your email address, phone number, government-issued identification numbers, emergency contact
                information, billing address, payment method or credit card information, your preferred travel
                connection and – where applicable – information about your loyalty, bonus or discount cards (e.g.
                mileage or frequent-flyer programs, railway customer cards). We will ask you for the data that the
                respective transportation provider requires to complete the booking process. Our forms show what kind of
                data is required for each respective booking. We cannot process your booking without provision of the
                required data. Credit card information will be immediately passed on to the respective payment provider.
                We only store truncated credit card data (e.g. “511111******1111”) for reporting purposes and fraud
                analysis. When you make a booking for someone else (e.g. your travel companion, business travel) through
                the Service Sites or the App, we will request personal information about such companion or such
                business. You should obtain the consent of all such individuals before providing their information to us
                as those individuals may not be able to independently view their information themselves if it is
                provided to us under your account. To the extent that your companion(s) may need to amend or delete
                their information, they can reach out to us using
privacy@omio.com
.
b) Should you opt to additionally register for a personal profile with Omio by creating a user account,
                this data will be stored with us for your future bookings.
c) If you contact us or our customer support (e.g. by email, telephone or contact form on the Service
                Sites), we use the data you provided (usually your contact information and your inquiry) to respond.
d) Call recording: When you make calls to our customer service team, you may be required to confirm that
                you have an existing reservation with us. Calls to our customer service team may be recorded for quality
                control and training purposes, which includes using the recordings to process claims and for fraud
                detection purposes. . You can opt-out from the call recording at any time during your conversation with
                our customer service team by notifying one of our agents.
e) We may invite you to take part in surveys from time to time. These surveys may help us conduct market
                research, analyze how to improve your experience on the Service Sites and the App, and improve the
                functionality and quality of our Products. We will collect the data provided by you when you submit any
                such survey responses.
We will retain Personal Data collected from you for as long as we have an existing legitimate business
                need to do so (such as the purposes set out in paragraphs a) to e) above). In some cases, We may retain
                your Personal Data for longer periods, in order to comply with statutory obligations. These include
                fraud investigations, tax and accounting obligations, or other legal purposes in line with applicable
                laws.
We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data based on the following;
The purpose for which we process the Personal Data,
The nature, and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed,
The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, and
Any applicable legal requirements (such as statutes of limitation).
Once the legitimate business purpose or legal obligation no longer exists, We will either delete or
                anonymize your personal data.
In addition, We’d like to remind You that You have rights in relation to Your Personal Data under the EU
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These include the right to be forgotten, the right to access
                Your Personal Data, the right to data portability, amongst others. You can exercise these rights at any
                time, subject to statutory legal obligations We may be subject to, by contacting our Data Protection
                Team at
privacy@omio.com
.
Furthermore, If you object to our data processing set out under this section, and no opt-out mechanism is
                available to you directly (for instance in your account settings), please send your objection to our
                Data Protection Team at
privacy@omio.com
.
Bookings for certain countries may be handled by our partner Amadeus IT Group SA (Salvador de Madariaga
                1, Madrid, 28027, Spain) and its affiliates. For such bookings, we may transmit your booking data to
                Amadeus, which processes the data under its own responsibility according to their data protection policy
                which we highly recommend you to carefully review on their website before making any such booking (see
                link
here
).
The Service Sites and App are intended to be used by adults only. We do not knowingly collect personal
                information from children under the age of 13. In the event that we have knowledge that a child under
                the age of 13 has submitted any personal information to us via the Services Sites or the App, we may use
                the email address or other contact information provided by the child for the sole purpose of responding
                to the child’s question or carrying out his or her request on a one-time-only basis. We will not use the
                email address provided by such child for any other purpose, and we will delete such information from our
                records once their question has been answered or the request has been fulfilled. If we become aware that
                we have unknowingly collected personal contact information other than an email address from a child
                under the age of 13, we will delete the information immediately.
3. Logging in with Facebook Connect
It may also be possible to log into our Service Sites using Facebook Connect. Doing so will not require
                you to register a separate user account with us. Instead, you may log in using your existing Facebook
                account. In the process, Facebook transmits certain pieces of your personal data to us. Facebook will
                inform you, during such registration process, about the data to be transmitted (“Facebook Data”). You
                will be given the explicit opportunity to consent or to refuse to the transmission of such Facebook
                Data. Facebook will not transmit any of your personal Facebook Data to us without your express
                permission. We will then be able to see your Facebook username and your public Facebook profile. We may
                use this Facebook Data solely for the purposes detailed in this privacy policy, or for purposes that we
                explain to you at the time we collect your personal information. Conversely, Facebook will be able to
                see whether and when you log into our site using Facebook Connect.
You can stop using Facebook Connect login to the Service Sites at any time and, if desired, create your
                own user profile account with us. Note that you can opt to use our Service Sites without creating a user
                account at all.
4. Newsletter and marketing emails
If you opt into our newsletter subscription (e.g. by subscribing via the Service Sites or when creating a
                user account), we will send you newsletters and marketing emails, including information about Omio,
                together with promotions for offers and services whether provided by us or third-parties (e.g. travel,
                accommodation).
If you have opted to receive our newsletter subscription, you can withdraw your consent by using the
                “unsubscribe” link included in each of our newsletter and marketing emails.
Upon the withdrawal of your consent or unsubscribing from the newsletter, we delete your contact
                information, unless the contact information remains stored for another reason described elsewhere in
                this privacy policy, such as part of your user account or in relation to your bookings, as described
                above.
5. Cookies, web beacons and similar technology
Like most other website operators, we use cookies, web beacons, and similar technology (collectively
                “Tracking Facilities”) when you visit or use our Service Sites.
Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your computer or mobile device and which
                allow re-identification of your computer or mobile device, potentially across numerous websites,
                including the Service Sites. These cookies contain no personal data. Some of the cookies we use are
                automatically deleted upon expiry of your session, that is, when you close your browser (these are
                referred to as session cookies). Other cookies remain stored on your device and allow us, or our
                business partners, to recognize your browser during subsequent visits (persistent cookies).
Our use of Tracking Facilities allows us to collect information about our users in order to provide
                simpler and more convenient access to our Service Sites, or to enable us to provide certain services at
                all.
We use Tracking Facilities for the following purposes:
To save your user settings such as language and currency while on using the Service Sites, and
                    between visits.
To store your login status as a registered user (optional), so you do not have to log in again when
                    returning to the Service Sites later.
For the technical assignment of your visit to certain servers to ensure a safe transition between
                    pages and search queries.
To monitor the performance of our systems (no user-based evaluation of data).
Service providers for website analysis, retargeting, and conversion tracking may also use Tracking
                    Facilities (see below).
If you click a link on the Service Sites that takes you to the website of a provider (for example when
                making a booking or to buy a ticket), it is possible that such other websites also store cookies on your
                computer. We have no control over these providers’ cookies and the data collected in this way and we
                cannot accept any responsibility for our providers’ websites or their tracking practices. We encourage
                you to carefully review the privacy policies of any website that you visit.
How do we use cookies?
We use different categories of cookies for different purposes (see below)
Mandatory for Use: We use strictly necessary cookies that are essential for You to browse the website
                properly and use its core features. As such they do not require Your consent. These cookies will
                generally be first-party cookies.

Category: Security

                user authentication for secure payment and fraud prevention. These may include third-party cookies, e.g.
                security cookies from the payment provider You selected when You are redirected to the payment page.
Category: Functionalities
Purpose: Core functionality cookies are necessary to ensure the proper functioning of our website and its
                essential features, such as travel service bookings and ticket issuance. These may include third-party
                cookies from our transportation providers when you are redirected to their website to finalize your
                booking.
Non-necessary cookies: We also use cookies and similar technologies that help us understand how you use

"Settings"
, which might affect your experience with our
                website.
Category: Performance and Statistics
Purpose: Performance & Statistics cookies are used to help understand personal and statistical use of our
                website to improve your user experience. As such they may include third-party cookies and similar

                websites and how different settings affect your user experience.
Category: Marketing
Purpose: Marketing cookies are used to assist our marketing efforts and improve online advertising
                performance. They allow us to track your online activity in order to place personalized and relevant
                advertisements from third-party Ads partners. We may upload your user identifiers received from these
                cookies to our Ads partner platform such as Facebook, Google and others to help improve the
                personalization
                of the advertisements.
6. Retargeting
Our Service Sites may use what are known as retargeting tags for presentation of interest-related
                advertising on third-party websites.
A retargeting tag is the name for a JavaScript element that is placed in our Service Site’s source code.
                If you visit a page on our Service Site that contains a retargeting tag, a provider of online
                advertising services (each a “Retargeting Provider”, e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.) places a cookie on
                your computer and allocates it to the corresponding retargeting target group lists. The Retargeting
                Provider uses the cookie to gather data related to your interests (e.g. the pages visited on the Service
                Sites or search queries), using pseudonymous identifies. Based on that information, the Retargeting
                Provider displays interest-based ads on third-party websites. No directly personally identifying data is
                stored or transmitted, and the usage profiles will not be merged with your personal data. However, the
                Retargeting Provider can potentially identify you and track your visits on our website, in particular,
                if you are a registered user of the particular Retargeting Provider (e.g. if you have a Google or
                Facebook account).
We use the following Retargeting Providers:

If you are a resident in Canada, you can follow this link:

You can object to usage-based online advertising by all or some providers on the same website. To access
                the preferences manager, click here:

If you are a resident in Canada, you can click here:
http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=3&lang=en
You can also prevent data transfer to all retargeting providers by Omio at any time by clicking the
                following link:
You opted out of tracking for advertising purposes. Click below to change that:
Allow tracking for advertising
                            purposes
Don't
                        track me for advertising purposes
If you click the link above, we will set a persistent cookie that allows us to recognize and observe your
                opt-out upon later visits to the Service Sites. Please note that it must be re-set when you delete all
                cookies in your browser. Opt-out cookies prevent tracking when you visit the Service Sites with a
                specific device, browser and domain. To prevent cookies on different devices or browsers, you must set
                the opt-out cookie by clicking the opt-out button on all devices/browsers. The same applies if you visit
                the Service Sites under different top-level domains (e.g. omio.com or omio.it).
                To prevent tracking in the App, please use the App’s opt-out function (see below).
7. Conversion tracking
We use advertising partners to advertise our offers on third-party websites. We also use marketing tools
                to determine the success of our advertising measures (“Conversion Tracking”). We intend to show you
                advertising relevant to your interests, to optimize our website, and to achieve a fair calculation of
                advertising costs.
To that end our advertising partners use cookies and web beacons (see above) to measure certain
                parameters related to the success of an advertising campaign, e.g. display of an ad or user clicks. The
                cookies are not intended to personally identify you. For the lifetime of the cookie the advertising
                partner can identify your clicks on an ad and your redirection to a certain landing page (e.g. form
                input, confirmation page, newsletter subscription). Based on this information, the advertising partner
                generates conversion statistics. These statistics show e.g. the number of users that have clicked on one
                of our ads. In addition, the statistics show the number of users that have reached a certain target page
                that has been marked with a “conversion tag” (remarketing tag, see above). The statistics do not include
                data that allows us to personally identify you.
We do not collect or use personal data in the advertising campaigns ourselves. Our advertising partners
                only provide us with statistical data, which allows us to identify effective advertising campaigns. We
                do not receive additional data, in particular no data that would allow us to identify our users.
Due to the Conversion Tracking tools, your browser automatically connects to the server of the
                advertising partners. We have no influence on the scope and further use of data collected by the
                Conversion Tracking tools of our advertising partners. The advertising partners receive the information
                that you have visited certain pages on the Service Sites or clicked on one of our ads. If you are a
                registered user of the advertising partner (e.g. if you have a Google or Facebook account), the
                advertising partner can relate your visits to such account data. Even if you are not a registered user
                with the advertising partner, or are not logged into your account, the advertising partner may collect
                and store your IP address.
We use Conversion Tracking with the following advertising partners:

                device, browser and domain. To prevent cookies on different devices or browsers, you must set the
                opt-out cookie by clicking the opt-out button on all devices/browsers. The same applies if you visit our
                website under different top-level domains (e.g. omio.com or omio.it). To
                prevent tracking in the App, please use the App’s opt-out function (see below).
8. Web analytics and statistics / Google Analytics
The Service Sites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. (“Google”).
                Google uses cookies (see above), which are stored on the user's computer and allow us to analyze the use
                of the Service Sites. The information generated by the cookie about the use, including the user’s
                current, but truncated EU IP addresses are transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
                Since we have activated IP anonymization, your IP address will be truncated by Google within a European
                Union member state or a member state of the European Economic Area before transmission to the USA. Only
                in exceptional circumstances will the full IP address be transferred from the EU and truncated in the
                USA. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of the Service Sites, compiling
                reports on the activities of users of our services, and to provide other services associated with
                internet use. In addition, Google may also transfer this information to third-parties if required to do
                so by law or where such third-parties process the information on Google's behalf. The IP address sent by
                your browser to Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
You can prevent the installation of cookies by changing the settings of your browser. Please note,
                however, that this may prevent some of our services’ feature from working correctly. Alternatively, you
                can prevent the collection of cookie data and your website usage data (including your IP address) by
                Google and the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing a browser plugin
                available at:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
In addition, you can disable data processing by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link:
Deactivate Google Analytics
This sets an opt-out cookie that prevents the future collection of your data when visiting the Service
                Sites. Please note that it must be reset when you delete all cookies in your browser.
This website utilizes Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIP()”. This extension ensures the
                processing of truncated IP addresses, so that no direct personal identification via IP addresses is
                possible.
Personal data associated with cookies, user identifiers (e.g., User-ID) and advertising identifiers
                (e.g., DoubleClick cookies, Android’s Advertising ID, Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers) will be
                deleted automatically after 14 months.
Use of Google Analytics is in accordance with the requirements agreed between the German data protection
                authorities and Google. Please find additional information here: Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd.,
                Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, Fax: +353 (1) 436 1001.

9. Social Plugins
The Service Sites use what are referred to as social plugins by the following social media providers:
We use the so-called 2-click solution. If you visit the Service Sites, no personal data is transferred to
                the plugin provider. You can recognize the plugin provider by the label or logo on the button. We permit
                you to communicate directly with the plugin provider via the button.
Only if you click the button and activate the plugin, the plugin provider receives the information that
                you have visited the respective page of the Service Sites. In addition, the information mentioned under
                Sec. 1 above is transferred by your browser to the plugin provider. If you have an account with the
                plugin provider, and are logged in, the provider may relate your visit to the Service Sites and your
                additional interaction with the social plugin (e.g. clicking on the “Like” button) to your user account
                (e.g. your Facebook account).
We have no influence on the data collected and processed by the plugin provider, nor do we know the full
                extent of the data processing, purposes, retention terms and deletion of data by the plugin provider.
                Please find additional information regarding data processing by the plugin provider in their respective
                privacy policies linked above. These policies also include information regarding your rights and
                privacy-related configuration options.
10. Data Breaches
In the unlikely event of any unauthorized access or acquisition of your personal data, or if we
                experience a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
                unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, your personal data, where such breach poses a significant risk
                of harm to your rights and freedoms, we will promptly notify you without undue delay and, where
                feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it. In such case, we will also inform
                governmental authorities of such breach as required by applicable law.
II. Omio app
The Omio applications (collectively referred to as the “App”) are alternative ways to access
                offers and services provided by Omio. The App records, processes and utilizes data in the same way as
                the Service Sites, for the same purposes and on the same legal basis. The contents of this portion of
                the privacy policy apply to the App.
1. Additional use of app-specific data
When using the App, Omio can access additional data relating to the App and your mobile device, e.g.
                the device name, device manufacturer, model, operating system version, app version or SDK version and
                the device number (IMEI), advertising identifiers (e.g. Android’s Advertising ID, Apple’s Identifier for
                Advertisers). If you are using an Android device, the App can also detect what Google services you have
                subscribed to and can prevent your device from going into standby while the App is running.
The App, for both Android and iOS, requires your permission in order to function properly. Once you grant
                such permission, the App may record your device’s geolocation to use it for processing your query (e.g.,
                filling in your location in the search form, to provide location-based services, or to suggest relevant
                content based on your location). Your location data is transmitted through an encrypted connection. If
                you use GPS, the App will detect your precise location. The data is used to fill in the search form and
                will not be stored otherwise. You may use your device’s settings menu to disable location data
                collection at any time.
2. Statistics and analytics
We use data analytics services to create statistics and analytics regarding your use of the App, the
                Service Sites, and our services. Data analytics services also assist when transitioning to our partner’s
                websites or services. We use the IP address and device identifier of your mobile device for such
                purposes. In addition, we may use such information to create cross-device, pseudonymous usage profiles
                (“cross-device-tracking”). You can disable the analytics functionality at any time in the App
                preferences.
In our apps, we use "Google Analytics" and “Firebase Analytics” as analytics services provided by Google
                LLC. (“Google”). Google provides SDKs (software development kits), which are stored on the user's device
                and allow us to analyze their use of the App. The information generated by the SDKs about such use,
                including the user’s current, but truncated IP address, are transmitted to a Google server in the USA
                and stored there. Since we have activated IP anonymization, your IP address, if collected in the EU,
                will be truncated by Google within a European Union member state or a member state of the European
                Economic Area before transmission to the USA. Only in exceptional circumstances will the full IP address
                be transferred and truncated in the USA. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the
                use of the App, compile reports on the activities of users of our services, and to provide other
                services associated with internet use. In addition, Google may also transfer this information to
                third-parties if required to do so by law or where such third-parties process the information on
                Google's behalf. The IP address sent by your App to Google Analytics or Firebase will not be merged with
                other Google data.
If you are using the App, you can disable data processing by Google Analytics or by Firebase by using the
                switch at the bottom of this page.
This app utilizes Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIP()”. This ensures processing of
                truncated IP addresses, so that no direct personal identification via IP addresses is possible.

3. Push messages
If you have configured your mobile device accordingly, the App may send you push messages, e.g. to
                provide updates on Omio, status updates, marketing campaigns and other news, or to notify you of new
                services, products, and features. Push messages may also include advertising for Omio or
                third-party offers (e.g. travel, accommodation).
You can withdraw your consent to receive marketing push messages at any time, free of charge, by
                disabling marketing push messages in the App settings or by deactivating push messages in your device’s
                operating system preferences.

                                online frauds. Our service provider may use and process your personal information in
                                accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws. You can read about the ways
                                by which our service provider may use and process your personal information in this

III. With whom do we share your Data?
1. Data processing by Our subsidiaries
Omio Corp. employs Omio Travel GmbH and Omio Services GmbH, (Warschauer Platz 12, 10245 Berlin,
                Germany) as a service provider to, among other things, operate computer systems, handle order processing
                and perform customer service. We may share your information with, and among, our affiliated in order to
                enhance the products and services that we provide. To the extent that affiliates have access to your
                information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices set forth in
                this privacy policy.
Omio Travel GmbH and Omio Services GmbH are subsidiaries of Omio Corp. Your personal data will be
                forwarded to Omio Travel GmbH and/or Omio Services GmbH or collected directly by Omio Travel GmbH and/or
                Omio Services GmbH on behalf of Omio Corp. Omio Travel GmbH and Omio Services GmbH will process your
                data solely in compliance with this privacy policy and only for the purposes of performing services for
                Omio Corp., for running the Service Sites, the App, related platforms and providing associated
                services. This privacy information therefore applies to data processing by Omio Travel GmbH and Omio
                Services GmbH as well. You can contact our data protection officer at
privacy@omio.com
.
We contractually oblige Omio Travel GmbH and Omio Services GmbH to observe the provisions of this privacy
                information, to process your data for the aforementioned purposes only and to observe all applicable
                data protection and data security law and regulations.
2. Data transmission related to bookings
a) Transportation provider
When you make a booking on the Service Sites or the App, we will transmit any personal data (including
                loyalty program membership information) required to execute such booking to the respective
                transportation provider (e.g. airline, railway or coach operator) so that the transportation provider
                can process your booking and produce any personalized tickets that may be required. Such a third-party
                will then process your personal data under its own responsibility and in accordance with its own privacy
                policies. We therefore strongly recommend that you carefully review the privacy policy for each such
                transportation service provider prior to making your booking.
Bookings may be handled by our subsidiary, Omio Voyages SAS. In such cases, we transmit the required data
                to Omio Voyages SAS, which processes the data on our behalf and only for the purposes of completing the
                booking process.
This data transfer requires that your explicit consent is given for each booking process, pursuant to
                Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.
To the extent that we participate in a corporate transaction, divestiture, merger, consolidation, or
                asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we will inform the buyer that it shall only use your
                personal information for the purposes disclosed in this privacy policy. From time to time, we may also
                share aggregate or anonymous information with third-parties, including advertisers and investors. For
                example, we may tell our investors the number of visitors that the Service Sites receive on a monthly
                basis, or we may tell advertisers where the most popular travel destinations are each month.
b) Payment providers
The payment details (credit card information) for bookings made directly on the Service Sites or through
                the App are processed by a trusted internet payment processor, who will transmit your data directly to
                the relevant credit card company.
In order to ensure that the credit card is being used by its legitimate owner, and to prevent cases of
                online fraud, encrypted credit card information is transferred to an external payment security service
                for auditing purposes. This transfer may also include additional personal data.
Your credit card data is processed by trusted and reliable internet payment processors. Your credit card
                details are encrypted (usually using the SSL protocol) before transmission to the payment processor.
                Your credit card data will not be disclosed to us by the payment processors.
c) Accommodation providers
In addition, the basic information of your query (such as destination and travel time) will be forwarded
                to the accommodation service providers displayed in the search window (e.g. Booking.com or Airbnb) - but
                only if you have explicitly included the respective service provider in the search query by selecting a
                checkbox. The service provider will then present you with non-binding offers matching your search query
                in a new window or tab. A transfer of personal data (except for the IP address) does not take place on
                our side.
3. Other service providers
We may use third party service providers, in particular for technical and business services, tax advisors
                and legal counsel. This may include hosting providers, including a content delivery network to cache and
                provide content, statistics and analytics, providers to handle service desk and support data, provision
                of CRM systems, sending of newsletters/mailings, spam and fraud prevention, IT service and development
                providers.
These service providers receive personal data solely for the performance of their services for us on our
                behalf. They are contractually obliged not to use personal data for other purposes.
4. Recipients outside of the EU
The data processing mentioned under Sec. I2a, I6-9, II2,3, III2,3 may result in data transmission to
                recipients outside of the EU. The data transmission is then based on the EC model contracts (
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm
).
Personal information may be transferred to third-parties, such as transportation providers, located in
                non-EU countries, in which the travel is scheduled to take place. Omio cannot provide any further
                information on the level of data protection offered in non-EU countries. Neither an adequacy decision in
                accordance with Art. 45 para. 3 GDPR or appropriate safeguards in accordance with Art 46 GDPR are
                required for such data transfer as it is necessary:
For the performance of a contract between you and Omio or the implementation of pre-contractual
                measures taken at your request (Art. 49(1)(b) GDPR); or for the conclusion or performance of a contract
                concluded in your interest between Omio and another natural or legal person (Art. 49(1)(c) GDPR).
IV. Purposes and legal basis of data processing
We will only process personal information in ways that are compatible with the purposes outlined in this
                privacy policy (or those you later authorize). We process your personal data for the following purposes
                and on the following legal basis:
a) Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR to enter into, perform, modify or terminate a contractual relationship
                with you, in particular:
to enable your access and use of the Service Sites and the App,
to facilitate your search queries and bookings,

Privacy Policy
Last updated: 27.05.2024
Omio Corp., a Delaware corporation with its operational headquarters located at Warschauer Platz 12,
                10245 Berlin, Germany, together with its subsidiaries and corporate affiliates (“we,” “us,” “our,” or
                “Omio”) respect your right to privacy and we take our responsibility to safeguard your
                private information very seriously. Omio Corp. is the operator of the Omio websites
                (collectively, our “Service Sites”) and the Omio mobile applications (collectively, the
                “App”), is the data ‘controller,’ as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). You can
                contact us at
info@omio.com
and our data protection officer at
privacy@omio.com
. If the Service Sites or the App connect you
                with third-party online services, you should carefully review the privacy policies of such third-party
                sites as they are not governed by our privacy policy.
We want to inform you about the way we collect and process your personal data in accordance with the GDPR
                and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).
I. What kind of data do we collect?
1. Automatically generated website visitor information
We collect information and data that is automatically transmitted or generated by your browser each time
                you visit our website. Such information includes the IP address, the URLs of the site you visited before
                accessing our Service Sites (“referrer”), the browser used, the browser language, the operating system
                and user interface, the access device used, date and time of your access, the pages viewed on our
                website, and the time you spend on the Service Sites. Such data is stored for a period of two years and
                deleted automatically thereafter. We may use this information to investigate errors, to improve the
                stability and functionality of the Service Sites and the App, and to assist you in completing any
                interrupted bookings.
2. Data provided by you / user accounts
Furthermore, we also collect and use the information you provide to us about yourself, your travel
                companions, and about the planning of your trip by using the Service Sites or the App:
a) When you book a travel product through our Service Sites, we ask you to provide personal data, e.g.
                your name, your email address, phone number, government-issued identification numbers, emergency contact
                information, billing address, payment method or credit card information, your preferred travel
                connection and – where applicable – information about your loyalty, bonus or discount cards (e.g.
                mileage or frequent-flyer programs, railway customer cards). We will ask you for the data that the
                respective transportation provider requires to complete the booking process. Our forms show what kind of
                data is required for each respective booking. We cannot process your booking without provision of the
                required data. Credit card information will be immediately passed on to the respective payment provider.
                We only store truncated credit card data (e.g. “511111******1111”) for reporting purposes and fraud
                analysis. When you make a booking for someone else (e.g. your travel companion, business travel) through
                the Service Sites or the App, we will request personal information about such companion or such
                business. You should obtain the consent of all such individuals before providing their information to us
                as those individuals may not be able to independently view their information themselves if it is
                provided to us under your account. To the extent that your companion(s) may need to amend or delete
                their information, they can reach out to us using
privacy@omio.com
.
b) Should you opt to additionally register for a personal profile with Omio by creating a user account,
                this data will be stored with us for your future bookings.
c) If you contact us or our customer support (e.g. by email, telephone or contact form on the Service
                Sites), we use the data you provided (usually your contact information and your inquiry) to respond.
d) Call recording: When you make calls to our customer service team, you may be required to confirm that
                you have an existing reservation with us. Calls to our customer service team may be recorded for quality
                control and training purposes, which includes using the recordings to process claims and for fraud
                detection purposes. . You can opt-out from the call recording at any time during your conversation with
                our customer service team by notifying one of our agents.
e) We may invite you to take part in surveys from time to time. These surveys may help us conduct market
                research, analyze how to improve your experience on the Service Sites and the App, and improve the
                functionality and quality of our Products. We will collect the data provided by you when you submit any
                such survey responses.
We will retain Personal Data collected from you for as long as we have an existing legitimate business
                need to do so (such as the purposes set out in paragraphs a) to e) above). In some cases, We may retain
                your Personal Data for longer periods, in order to comply with statutory obligations. These include
                fraud investigations, tax and accounting obligations, or other legal purposes in line with applicable
                laws.
We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data based on the following;
The purpose for which we process the Personal Data,
The nature, and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed,
The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, and
Any applicable legal requirements (such as statutes of limitation).
Once the legitimate business purpose or legal obligation no longer exists, We will either delete or
                anonymize your personal data.
In addition, We’d like to remind You that You have rights in relation to Your Personal Data under the EU
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These include the right to be forgotten, the right to access
                Your Personal Data, the right to data portability, amongst others. You can exercise these rights at any
                time, subject to statutory legal obligations We may be subject to, by contacting our Data Protection
                Team at
privacy@omio.com
.
Furthermore, If you object to our data processing set out under this section, and no opt-out mechanism is
                available to you directly (for instance in your account settings), please send your objection to our
                Data Protection Team at
privacy@omio.com
.
Bookings for certain countries may be handled by our partner Amadeus IT Group SA (Salvador de Madariaga
                1, Madrid, 28027, Spain) and its affiliates. For such bookings, we may transmit your booking data to
                Amadeus, which processes the data under its own responsibility according to their data protection policy
                which we highly recommend you to carefully review on their website before making any such booking (see
                link
here
).
The Service Sites and App are intended to be used by adults only. We do not knowingly collect personal
                information from children under the age of 13. In the event that we have knowledge that a child under
                the age of 13 has submitted any personal information to us via the Services Sites or the App, we may use
                the email address or other contact information provided by the child for the sole purpose of responding
                to the child’s question or carrying out his or her request on a one-time-only basis. We will not use the
                email address provided by such child for any other purpose, and we will delete such information from our
                records once their question has been answered or the request has been fulfilled. If we become aware that
                we have unknowingly collected personal contact information other than an email address from a child
                under the age of 13, we will delete the information immediately.
3. Logging in with Facebook Connect
It may also be possible to log into our Service Sites using Facebook Connect. Doing so will not require
                you to register a separate user account with us. Instead, you may log in using your existing Facebook
                account. In the process, Facebook transmits certain pieces of your personal data to us. Facebook will
                inform you, during such registration process, about the data to be transmitted (“Facebook Data”). You
                will be given the explicit opportunity to consent or to refuse to the transmission of such Facebook
                Data. Facebook will not transmit any of your personal Facebook Data to us without your express
                permission. We will then be able to see your Facebook username and your public Facebook profile. We may
                use this Facebook Data solely for the purposes detailed in this privacy policy, or for purposes that we
                explain to you at the time we collect your personal information. Conversely, Facebook will be able to
                see whether and when you log into our site using Facebook Connect.
You can stop using Facebook Connect login to the Service Sites at any time and, if desired, create your
                own user profile account with us. Note that you can opt to use our Service Sites without creating a user
                account at all.
4. Newsletter and marketing emails
If you opt into our newsletter subscription (e.g. by subscribing via the Service Sites or when creating a
                user account), we will send you newsletters and marketing emails, including information about Omio,
                together with promotions for offers and services whether provided by us or third-parties (e.g. travel,
                accommodation).
If you have opted to receive our newsletter subscription, you can withdraw your consent by using the
                “unsubscribe” link included in each of our newsletter and marketing emails.
Upon the withdrawal of your consent or unsubscribing from the newsletter, we delete your contact
                information, unless the contact information remains stored for another reason described elsewhere in
                this privacy policy, such as part of your user account or in relation to your bookings, as described
                above.
5. Cookies, web beacons and similar technology
Like most other website operators, we use cookies, web beacons, and similar technology (collectively
                “Tracking Facilities”) when you visit or use our Service Sites.
Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your computer or mobile device and which
                allow re-identification of your computer or mobile device, potentially across numerous websites,
                including the Service Sites. These cookies contain no personal data. Some of the cookies we use are
                automatically deleted upon expiry of your session, that is, when you close your browser (these are
                referred to as session cookies). Other cookies remain stored on your device and allow us, or our
                business partners, to recognize your browser during subsequent visits (persistent cookies).
Our use of Tracking Facilities allows us to collect information about our users in order to provide
                simpler and more convenient access to our Service Sites, or to enable us to provide certain services at
                all.
We use Tracking Facilities for the following purposes:
To save your user settings such as language and currency while on using the Service Sites, and
                    between visits.
To store your login status as a registered user (optional), so you do not have to log in again when
                    returning to the Service Sites later.
For the technical assignment of your visit to certain servers to ensure a safe transition between
                    pages and search queries.
To monitor the performance of our systems (no user-based evaluation of data).
Service providers for website analysis, retargeting, and conversion tracking may also use Tracking
                    Facilities (see below).
If you click a link on the Service Sites that takes you to the website of a provider (for example when
                making a booking or to buy a ticket), it is possible that such other websites also store cookies on your
                computer. We have no control over these providers’ cookies and the data collected in this way and we
                cannot accept any responsibility for our providers’ websites or their tracking practices. We encourage
                you to carefully review the privacy policies of any website that you visit.

6. Retargeting
Our Service Sites may use what are known as retargeting tags for presentation of interest-related
                advertising on third-party websites.
A retargeting tag is the name for a JavaScript element that is placed in our Service Site’s source code.
                If you visit a page on our Service Site that contains a retargeting tag, a provider of online
                advertising services (each a “Retargeting Provider”, e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.) places a cookie on
                your computer and allocates it to the corresponding retargeting target group lists. The Retargeting
                Provider uses the cookie to gather data related to your interests (e.g. the pages visited on the Service
                Sites or search queries), using pseudonymous identifies. Based on that information, the Retargeting
                Provider displays interest-based ads on third-party websites. No directly personally identifying data is
                stored or transmitted, and the usage profiles will not be merged with your personal data. However, the
                Retargeting Provider can potentially identify you and track your visits on our website, in particular,
                if you are a registered user of the particular Retargeting Provider (e.g. if you have a Google or
                Facebook account).
We use the following Retargeting Providers:

                cookies in your browser. Opt-out cookies prevent tracking when you visit the Service Sites with a
                specific device, browser and domain. To prevent cookies on different devices or browsers, you must set
                the opt-out cookie by clicking the opt-out button on all devices/browsers. The same applies if you visit
                the Service Sites under different top-level domains (e.g. omio.com or omio.it).
                To prevent tracking in the App, please use the App’s opt-out function (see below).
7. Conversion tracking
We use advertising partners to advertise our offers on third-party websites. We also use marketing tools
                to determine the success of our advertising measures (“Conversion Tracking”). We intend to show you
                advertising relevant to your interests, to optimize our website, and to achieve a fair calculation of
                advertising costs.
To that end our advertising partners use cookies and web beacons (see above) to measure certain
                parameters related to the success of an advertising campaign, e.g. display of an ad or user clicks. The
                cookies are not intended to personally identify you. For the lifetime of the cookie the advertising
                partner can identify your clicks on an ad and your redirection to a certain landing page (e.g. form
                input, confirmation page, newsletter subscription). Based on this information, the advertising partner
                generates conversion statistics. These statistics show e.g. the number of users that have clicked on one
                of our ads. In addition, the statistics show the number of users that have reached a certain target page
                that has been marked with a “conversion tag” (remarketing tag, see above). The statistics do not include
                data that allows us to personally identify you.
We do not collect or use personal data in the advertising campaigns ourselves. Our advertising partners
                only provide us with statistical data, which allows us to identify effective advertising campaigns. We
                do not receive additional data, in particular no data that would allow us to identify our users.
Due to the Conversion Tracking tools, your browser automatically connects to the server of the
                advertising partners. We have no influence on the scope and further use of data collected by the
                Conversion Tracking tools of our advertising partners. The advertising partners receive the information
                that you have visited certain pages on the Service Sites or clicked on one of our ads. If you are a
                registered user of the advertising partner (e.g. if you have a Google or Facebook account), the
                advertising partner can relate your visits to such account data. Even if you are not a registered user
                with the advertising partner, or are not logged into your account, the advertising partner may collect
                and store your IP address.
We use Conversion Tracking with the following advertising partners:

If you click the link above, we will set a persistent cookie that allows us to recognize and observe your
                opt-out upon later visits to the Service Sites. Please note that it must be re-set when you delete all
                cookies in your browser. Opt-out cookies prevent tracking when you visit our website with a specific
                device, browser and domain. To prevent cookies on different devices or browsers, you must set the

                prevent tracking in the App, please use the App’s opt-out function (see below).
8. Web analytics and statistics / Google Analytics
The Service Sites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. (“Google”).
                Google uses cookies (see above), which are stored on the user's computer and allow us to analyze the use
                of the Service Sites. The information generated by the cookie about the use, including the user’s
                current, but truncated EU IP addresses are transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
                Since we have activated IP anonymization, your IP address will be truncated by Google within a European
                Union member state or a member state of the European Economic Area before transmission to the USA. Only
                in exceptional circumstances will the full IP address be transferred from the EU and truncated in the
                USA. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of the Service Sites, compiling
                reports on the activities of users of our services, and to provide other services associated with
                internet use. In addition, Google may also transfer this information to third-parties if required to do
                so by law or where such third-parties process the information on Google's behalf. The IP address sent by
                your browser to Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
You can prevent the installation of cookies by changing the settings of your browser. Please note,
                however, that this may prevent some of our services’ feature from working correctly. Alternatively, you
                can prevent the collection of cookie data and your website usage data (including your IP address) by
                Google and the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing a browser plugin
                available at:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
In addition, you can disable data processing by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link:
Deactivate Google Analytics
This sets an opt-out cookie that prevents the future collection of your data when visiting the Service
                Sites. Please note that it must be reset when you delete all cookies in your browser.
This website utilizes Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIP()”. This extension ensures the
                processing of truncated IP addresses, so that no direct personal identification via IP addresses is
                possible.
Personal data associated with cookies, user identifiers (e.g., User-ID) and advertising identifiers
                (e.g., DoubleClick cookies, Android’s Advertising ID, Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers) will be
                deleted automatically after 14 months.
Use of Google Analytics is in accordance with the requirements agreed between the German data protection
                authorities and Google. Please find additional information here: Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd.,
                Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, Fax: +353 (1) 436 1001.

9. Social Plugins
The Service Sites use what are referred to as social plugins by the following social media providers:
We use the so-called 2-click solution. If you visit the Service Sites, no personal data is transferred to
                the plugin provider. You can recognize the plugin provider by the label or logo on the button. We permit
                you to communicate directly with the plugin provider via the button.
Only if you click the button and activate the plugin, the plugin provider receives the information that
                you have visited the respective page of the Service Sites. In addition, the information mentioned under
                Sec. 1 above is transferred by your browser to the plugin provider. If you have an account with the
                plugin provider, and are logged in, the provider may relate your visit to the Service Sites and your
                additional interaction with the social plugin (e.g. clicking on the “Like” button) to your user account
                (e.g. your Facebook account).
We have no influence on the data collected and processed by the plugin provider, nor do we know the full
                extent of the data processing, purposes, retention terms and deletion of data by the plugin provider.
                Please find additional information regarding data processing by the plugin provider in their respective
                privacy policies linked above. These policies also include information regarding your rights and
                privacy-related configuration options.
10. Data Breaches
In the unlikely event of any unauthorized access or acquisition of your personal data, or if we
                experience a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
                unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, your personal data, where such breach poses a significant risk
                of harm to your rights and freedoms, we will promptly notify you without undue delay and, where
                feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it. In such case, we will also inform
                governmental authorities of such breach as required by applicable law.
II. Omio app
The Omio applications (collectively referred to as the “App”) are alternative ways to access
                offers and services provided by Omio. The App records, processes and utilizes data in the same way as
                the Service Sites, for the same purposes and on the same legal basis. The contents of this portion of
                the privacy policy apply to the App.
1. Additional use of app-specific data
When using the App, Omio can access additional data relating to the App and your mobile device, e.g.
                the device name, device manufacturer, model, operating system version, app version or SDK version and
                the device number (IMEI), advertising identifiers (e.g. Android’s Advertising ID, Apple’s Identifier for
                Advertisers). If you are using an Android device, the App can also detect what Google services you have
                subscribed to and can prevent your device from going into standby while the App is running.
The App, for both Android and iOS, requires your permission in order to function properly. Once you grant
                such permission, the App may record your device’s geolocation to use it for processing your query (e.g.,
                filling in your location in the search form, to provide location-based services, or to suggest relevant
                content based on your location). Your location data is transmitted through an encrypted connection. If
                you use GPS, the App will detect your precise location. The data is used to fill in the search form and
                will not be stored otherwise. You may use your device’s settings menu to disable location data
                collection at any time.
2. Statistics and analytics
We use data analytics services to create statistics and analytics regarding your use of the App, the
                Service Sites, and our services. Data analytics services also assist when transitioning to our partner’s
                websites or services. We use the IP address and device identifier of your mobile device for such
                purposes. In addition, we may use such information to create cross-device, pseudonymous usage profiles
                (“cross-device-tracking”). You can disable the analytics functionality at any time in the App
                preferences.
In our apps, we use "Google Analytics" and “Firebase Analytics” as analytics services provided by Google
                LLC. (“Google”). Google provides SDKs (software development kits), which are stored on the user's device
                and allow us to analyze their use of the App. The information generated by the SDKs about such use,
                including the user’s current, but truncated IP address, are transmitted to a Google server in the USA
                and stored there. Since we have activated IP anonymization, your IP address, if collected in the EU,
                will be truncated by Google within a European Union member state or a member state of the European
                Economic Area before transmission to the USA. Only in exceptional circumstances will the full IP address
                be transferred and truncated in the USA. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the
                use of the App, compile reports on the activities of users of our services, and to provide other
                services associated with internet use. In addition, Google may also transfer this information to
                third-parties if required to do so by law or where such third-parties process the information on
                Google's behalf. The IP address sent by your App to Google Analytics or Firebase will not be merged with
                other Google data.
If you are using the App, you can disable data processing by Google Analytics or by Firebase by using the
                switch at the bottom of this page.
This app utilizes Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIP()”. This ensures processing of
                truncated IP addresses, so that no direct personal identification via IP addresses is possible.

3. Push messages
If you have configured your mobile device accordingly, the App may send you push messages, e.g. to
                provide updates on Omio, status updates, marketing campaigns and other news, or to notify you of new
                services, products, and features. Push messages may also include advertising for Omio or
                third-party offers (e.g. travel, accommodation).
You can withdraw your consent to receive marketing push messages at any time, free of charge, by
                disabling marketing push messages in the App settings or by deactivating push messages in your device’s
                operating system preferences.

III. With whom do we share your Data?
1. Data processing by Our subsidiaries
Omio Corp. employs Omio Travel GmbH and Omio Services GmbH, (Warschauer Platz 12, 10245 Berlin,
                Germany) as a service provider to, among other things, operate computer systems, handle order processing
                and perform customer service. We may share your information with, and among, our affiliated in order to
                enhance the products and services that we provide. To the extent that affiliates have access to your
                information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices set forth in
                this privacy policy.
Omio Travel GmbH and Omio Services GmbH are subsidiaries of Omio Corp. Your personal data will be
                forwarded to Omio Travel GmbH and/or Omio Services GmbH or collected directly by Omio Travel GmbH and/or
                Omio Services GmbH on behalf of Omio Corp. Omio Travel GmbH and Omio Services GmbH will process your
                data solely in compliance with this privacy policy and only for the purposes of performing services for
                Omio Corp., for running the Service Sites, the App, related platforms and providing associated
                services. This privacy information therefore applies to data processing by Omio Travel GmbH and Omio
                Services GmbH as well. You can contact our data protection officer at
privacy@omio.com
.
We contractually oblige Omio Travel GmbH and Omio Services GmbH to observe the provisions of this privacy
                information, to process your data for the aforementioned purposes only and to observe all applicable
                data protection and data security law and regulations.
2. Data transmission related to bookings
a) Transportation provider
When you make a booking on the Service Sites or the App, we will transmit any personal data (including
                loyalty program membership information) required to execute such booking to the respective
                transportation provider (e.g. airline, railway or coach operator) so that the transportation provider
                can process your booking and produce any personalized tickets that may be required. Such a third-party
                will then process your personal data under its own responsibility and in accordance with its own privacy
                policies. We therefore strongly recommend that you carefully review the privacy policy for each such
                transportation service provider prior to making your booking.
Bookings may be handled by our subsidiary, Omio Voyages SAS. In such cases, we transmit the required data
                to Omio Voyages SAS, which processes the data on our behalf and only for the purposes of completing the
                booking process.
This data transfer requires that your explicit consent is given for each booking process, pursuant to
                Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.
To the extent that we participate in a corporate transaction, divestiture, merger, consolidation, or
                asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we will inform the buyer that it shall only use your
                personal information for the purposes disclosed in this privacy policy. From time to time, we may also
                share aggregate or anonymous information with third-parties, including advertisers and investors. For
                example, we may tell our investors the number of visitors that the Service Sites receive on a monthly
                basis, or we may tell advertisers where the most popular travel destinations are each month.
b) Payment providers
The payment details (credit card information) for bookings made directly on the Service Sites or through
                the App are processed by a trusted internet payment processor, who will transmit your data directly to
                the relevant credit card company.
In order to ensure that the credit card is being used by its legitimate owner, and to prevent cases of
                online fraud, encrypted credit card information is transferred to an external payment security service
                for auditing purposes. This transfer may also include additional personal data.
Your credit card data is processed by trusted and reliable internet payment processors. Your credit card
                details are encrypted (usually using the SSL protocol) before transmission to the payment processor.
                Your credit card data will not be disclosed to us by the payment processors.
c) Accommodation providers
In addition, the basic information of your query (such as destination and travel time) will be forwarded
                to the accommodation service providers displayed in the search window (e.g. Booking.com or Airbnb) - but
                only if you have explicitly included the respective service provider in the search query by selecting a
                checkbox. The service provider will then present you with non-binding offers matching your search query
                in a new window or tab. A transfer of personal data (except for the IP address) does not take place on
                our side.
3. Other service providers
We may use third party service providers, in particular for technical and business services, tax advisors
                and legal counsel. This may include hosting providers, including a content delivery network to cache and
                provide content, statistics and analytics, providers to handle service desk and support data, provision
                of CRM systems, sending of newsletters/mailings, spam and fraud prevention, IT service and development
                providers.
These service providers receive personal data solely for the performance of their services for us on our
                behalf. They are contractually obliged not to use personal data for other purposes.
4. Recipients outside of the EU
The data processing mentioned under Sec. I2a, I6-9, II2,3, III2,3 may result in data transmission to
                recipients outside of the EU. The data transmission is then based on the EC model contracts (
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm
).
Personal information may be transferred to third-parties, such as transportation providers, located in
                non-EU countries, in which the travel is scheduled to take place. Omio cannot provide any further
                information on the level of data protection offered in non-EU countries. Neither an adequacy decision in
                accordance with Art. 45 para. 3 GDPR or appropriate safeguards in accordance with Art 46 GDPR are
                required for such data transfer as it is necessary:
For the performance of a contract between you and Omio or the implementation of pre-contractual
                measures taken at your request (Art. 49(1)(b) GDPR); or for the conclusion or performance of a contract
                concluded in your interest between Omio and another natural or legal person (Art. 49(1)(c) GDPR).
IV. Purposes and legal basis of data processing
We will only process personal information in ways that are compatible with the purposes outlined in this
                privacy policy (or those you later authorize). We process your personal data for the following purposes
                and on the following legal basis:
a) Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR to enter into, perform, modify or terminate a contractual relationship
                with you, in particular:

to facilitate your search queries and bookings,
to perform our contractual obligations,
to personalize your ticket or booking and to contact you with regards to the booking process or your
                    user account, for example to send you travel documents,
to facilitate your account login on the Service Sites or the App (user account functionality), to
                    recognize you as a user and spare you from re-entering your data upon your revisits to the Service
                    Sites or the App.
b) Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR based on our legitimate interests,

                    activities, or mitigate the risk of occurrence of the aforementioned events,
to ensure network and information security,
to create statistics on access channels, the use the Service Sites and App and the frequency of
                    transition to our partner’s websites and services,
for internal accounting and invoicing purposes with the respective transportation providers,
                    accommodation or other partners and service providers,
to personalize the Service Sites, the App, and our offers,
to display advertisements and special offers that may match your interests (or reduce your exposure
                    to advertising and special offers which you may find uninteresting),
for marketing purposes and to optimize our marketing measures,
to enable your interaction with social networks and other users, in order to improve our offers and
                    make it more interesting for our users, to contact you, if requested by you or as necessary to
                    fulfil the contract or as otherwise permitted by law,
for the purpose of business process outsourcing to affiliated companies,
enforcing obligations owed to us, and contractual terms and conditions, accounting, risk management
                    and record keeping.
When using personal data to serve the above-mentioned legitimate interests, we will always balance your
                rights and interests in protecting your personal data against the rights and interests of our company,
                our affiliates, and trusted third-parties.
c) Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR based on your consent,
to send you newsletter emails or other marketing push messages (see above),

                this policy

Legal frameworks for data transfers
Effective September 16, 2024
|
Archived versions
We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in the
Privacy Policy
. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the frameworks described below.
Adequacy decisions
The European Commission has determined that certain countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) adequately protect personal information, which means that data can be transferred from the European Union (EU) and Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland to those countries. The UK and Switzerland have adopted similar adequacy mechanisms. We rely on the following adequacy mechanisms:
European Commission adequacy decisions
UK adequacy regulations
Swiss adequacy decisions
EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework certification
, we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for external processing on our behalf, as described in the
“Sharing your information” section of our Privacy Policy
. To learn more about the DPF, and to view Google’s certification, please visit the
DPF website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF certification, we encourage you to
contact us
. Google is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the DPF Principles
.
Standard contractual clauses
Standard contractual clauses (SCCs) are written commitments between parties that can be used as a ground for data transfers from the EEA to third countries by providing appropriate data protection safeguards. SCCs have been approved by the European Commission and can not be modified by the parties using them (you can see the SCCs adopted by the European Commission
here
,
here
, and
here
). Such clauses have also been approved for transfers of data to countries outside the UK and Switzerland. We rely on SCCs for our data transfers where required and in instances where they are not covered by an adequacy decision. If you want to obtain a copy of the SCCs, you can
contact us
.
Google may also incorporate SCCs into contracts with customers of its business services, including
Google Workspace
,
Google Cloud Platform
,
Google Ads
, and other
ads and measurement products

us
” or the “
Company
” is a reference to Braze, Inc. and the relevant affiliate(s) involved in the processing activity.
Braze is a life-cycle engagement platform for companies around the world, supporting stronger relationships between brands and their clients, primarily by leveraging first party data to personalize and automate life-cycle marketing campaigns through first party channels, such as email, SMS, mobile and web push notifications, and in-app/in-browser messaging.

1.3 SCOPE OF THIS POLICY
What is in Scope?
This Privacy Policy applies to Braze, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data for our marketing or business purposes (further details below) and in such capacity, we will use the term “Data Controller”.
What is not in Scope?
Our Websites and Services are intended to be used by businesses and their representatives. We do not offer any products or services to individuals for personal, family or household use. All Personal Data that we process is treated as belonging to individuals in a business capacity.
Braze’s privacy commitments to its customers, where we process Personal Data on behalf of our customers, are outlined in Braze’s agreements with such customers. In our capacity as a processor of our customers’ data, we will refer to ourselves as a “Data Processor.” Specifically, in that capacity, Braze processes Personal Data of people who interact with customer applications or websites that are offered by our customers and that have incorporated Braze technology (“
Customer Applications
”). The protections that apply to such Personal Data will be described in the individual privacy policies of those customers, and not in this Privacy Policy. If you wish to learn more about the privacy and data security practices of those customers, you should reach out to them directly. For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not cover any Personal Data that our customers choose to collect and share with Braze, where Braze is not the Data Controller, but is instead a Data Processor.
Individuals who are interested in, apply for, or are recruited for a job with Braze can find our related privacy practices described in our Candidate's Privacy Policy. For more details, please
view our Candidate Privacy Policy
.
Additionally, our Websites or Services (as defined below) may contain links to other websites, applications and services maintained by third parties.

Braze Affiliates -
We may disclose Personal Data to Braze corporate group affiliates in connection with customer or technical support, marketing, business development, operations, account management, events or webinars, for general business purposes, in order to protect, exercise, establish or defend legal rights, where we are legally required to do so and to receive professional advice.

PART III. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION
3.1 PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE
Braze, Inc. is located in the United States ("
U.S.
") and our group companies operate in Singapore, Germany, Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom ("
UK
"), Ireland, Romania, Brazil, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. Braze works with vendors and partners who operate predominantly in these countries. From time to time, we may work with vendors and partners in other parts of the world where we do business. This means that when we collect your Personal Data, we may process it in any of these countries. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective), but we have in place appropriate safeguards and international transfer mechanisms (e.g., the Data Privacy Framework or the EU Standard Contractual Clauses). We also implement a number of supplementary measures designed to better protect the Personal Data with which we are entrusted.
Where available, Braze, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, as applicable, to the US in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework. For more details, please
read our Data Privacy Framework Notice
.
For non-US transfers, Braze may rely on an alternative transfer mechanism, including the 2021 EU Standard Contractual Clauses, to transfer Personal Data from the UK and European Economic Area ("
EEA
") to other third-party countries.
3.2 SECURITY
We use a number of technical, organizational and administrative security measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of information. However, security risk is inherent in internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data.
3.3 DATA RETENTION
We will retain Personal Data we collect from you for so long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (in connection with the purposes set out in Part II above). We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the purpose for which we process the Personal Data, the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymize it.
PART IV. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
4.1 EXERCISING YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
You may have the right under applicable law to request that we take certain actions in connection with Personal Data that we may have about you. Not all jurisdictions grant privacy rights, so whether or not you have any such rights, and the nature of those rights, if any, are determined by multiple factors, including your location, country, state, or place of residence. Privacy rights may include the following:
Information:
You may be able to request information about the categories of Personal Data we collect, the categories of sources from which we collect it, the purposes for which we process it, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.
Access:
You may be able to request access to the Personal Data we hold about you.
Rectification/correction
: You may be able to request modification or correction of your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
Erasure/deletion:
You may be able to request that we delete Personal Data we hold about you.
Restriction:
You may be able to request that we restrict use of your Personal Data.
Objection:
You may be able to object to the processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing or where our legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest.
Portability:
You may be able to request a copy of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, to allow you to transfer your data to another provider.
Automated Decision Making:
You may be able to request not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, where it produces a legal or similar effect.
If you wish to exercise any of these requests, please
fill out the form provided
. We will respond to requests from individuals wishing to exercise data protection rights applicable to them. For certain rights, such as where you request access to Personal Data, we will need to confirm your identity. To verify your identity, we will require you to provide ID, where permitted or required by applicable law. You also have the right to exercise your applicable privacy rights free from discriminatory treatment and retaliation as prohibited by applicable law. These rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline or partially decline your request as permitted by law.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local supervisory authority. If you have a question about your privacy rights, please email us at
privacy@braze.com
.
4.2 PRIVACY RIGHTS AND BRAZE CUSTOMERS
Braze customers may collect Personal Data through their websites or applications and send that data to the Braze Services. Where you wish to enforce any of your rights in respect of such data, we encourage you to contact the customer who provides you with the Customer Application, as this will be the quickest way to have your request processed. Where you submit a request about a Braze customer and you are able to identify the customer, we forward your request to the customer to handle.
4.3 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
At any time, you have the right to opt-out of marketing communications that we send, or object to the use of your personal data for behavioral advertising. You can exercise these rights by
visiting the Braze Preference Center
for managing your communication preferences, or by using the contact details provided under the '
How to Contact Us
' heading below. Dashboard Users of the Services may exercise this right through preference center options available within the Services. Where applicable, you may also opt-out through unsubscribe options available within the marketing communication itself.
Please note that opting-out of the receipt of marketing communications or objecting to the use of your personal data for behavioral advertising does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about event registrations, service announcements or security information.
4.4 COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
You can manage your cookie preferences by
visiting our Cookie Consent Manager to customize your cookie settings
. Please see our
Cookie Policy
for further information on cookies and other tracking technologies.
4.5 CHAT TECHNOLOGIES
We use chat technologies provided by third-party vendors that employ cookies and software code to operate the chat features you can use to communicate with us through our Websites. We and such third-party vendors may monitor, record and use information from your interactions with our Websites. This information includes details you have shared through online chats, data on sections of the Website you have visited, your IP address and your general geographic information (e.g., city, state). This Personal Data may be processed for the purposes outlined in Section 2.2 of this Privacy Policy.
PART V. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA
If you are from a region that requires us to have a legal basis for processing your Personal Data, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
PART VI. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
If you are a California resident, this section applies to you in addition to the rest of the Privacy Policy. It provides more detail on how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this Part VI, Personal Information has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“
CCPA
”). However, this Part VI does not apply:
To information exempted from the scope of the CCPA;
To Personal Information we collect, use, and disclose on behalf of our customers as a "service provider" under the CCPA for purposes of providing our Services to them.
6.1 YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
As a California resident, you have information, access, rectification/correction, erasure/deletion, and non-discrimination rights as described in Part IV (Your Privacy Rights). In addition, you have the right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information as those terms are defined by the CCPA.
If you have appointed an authorized agent to act on your behalf, your authorized agent may request to exercise these rights on your behalf upon our verification of the agent’s identity and our receipt of a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable California law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you and/or your agent to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as information required to verify your identity and that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
6.2 CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT AND THIRD PARTIES TO WHOM THE DATA MAY BE DISCLOSED
The following chart describes our practices currently in use and in use during the past 12 months. This chart summarizes the Personal Information we collect by reference to the statutory categories specified in the CCPA, and the categories of third parties to whom we may disclose it for a business purpose.

Information you voluntarily provide to us, such as in free-form webforms or via email, may contain other categories of Personal Information not described below. The business/commercial purposes for which we use these categories of Personal Information listed in the below table are described above in Section 2.2 (Purposes of Processing).

6.3 THE SALE AND SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Like many companies, Braze uses services that employ cookies and other technologies to collect Personal Information (including the identifiers and internet activity information described in the table above) about your use of our Websites and other online services over time, which helps us to deliver behavioral advertising. In addition, we may provide your contact details to our advertising vendors for the placement of targeted ads. Braze may share contact details of business contacts with our technology or solutions partners during any sales negotiations. Our use of some of these services constitutes the “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information as defined under the CCPA.
You may opt-out of such sales or sharing by clicking on the 'Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information'
link
in the footer of our Websites and following the instructions therein. You can also opt-out of advertising cookies by
visiting our Cookie Consent Manager to adjust your cookie preferences
, or by enabling
Global Privacy Control
(“GPC”) in your web browser or browser extension, which we recognize to the extent required by applicable law. Enabling GPC will automatically set your cookie settings to opt out of the sharing of Personal Information for behavioral advertising. If you choose to use GPC, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use. Other than GPC, we do not recognize any “do not track” signals.
Dashboard Users of the Services can also opt-out of the selling or sharing of contact details through setting preference center options available within the Services.
While our Website and Services are not directed to children under the age of 16, we are required to inform you that we have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the Personal Information of California residents under 16 years of age.
6.4 SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND DE-IDENTIFIED DATA
Braze does not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information (as defined by the CCPA) for restricted purposes that California residents have a right to limit under the CCPA.
We do not to attempt to re-identify de-identified information that we derive from Personal Information, except for the purpose of testing whether our deidentification processes comply with applicable law.
