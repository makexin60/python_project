These measures include without limitation, those already mentioned, such as:

How do we process data on behalf of third parties?
As mentioned in the chapter dedicated to the Data Controller, the Center or the individual Teacher who contracts our services will be responsible for the processing of the teachers, students and students legal representatives data in the Additio App. In these cases, Additio App will process these data on behalf of the Center or the Teacher, who has contracted us, as the person in charge of the treatment, in accordance with the provisions of article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 27, 2016 (GDPR). Therefore in Additio App:
a. We will process personal data only if we receive documented instructions from the Data Controller, even if it is about personal data transfers to a third country or an international organization, unless we are required by the right of the Union or of the Member States we are subjected to. In such a case, we will notify the Responsible of this legal requirement before processing, unless this right forbids it due to important reasons of public interest.

c. We apply the relevant technical and organizational measures to guarantee appropriate risk control considering the data processing that we manage in accordance with article 32 of the GDPR.
d. We will respect the conditions mentioned in sections 2 and 4 of article 28 of the GDPR to resort to another Data Controller, so we will not subcontract any of the services that are part of this contract purpose and involve the processing of personal data, except those auxiliary services necessary for the proper performance of our services, as explained in the section of this privacy policy referring to the recipients of the data.
If it were necessary to subcontract any other treatment, this would only be contracted with entities that guarantee compliance with the GDPR and this contract will be communicated to the Responsible Party, indicating the treatments that are intended to be subcontracted and clearly and unequivocally identifying the subcontractor company and its data. Outsourcing may be implemented if the Responsible does not object within a period of 10 days of such communication.

f. We will help the Responsible ensure compliance with the obligations on data security established in articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR, considering the nature of the treatment and the information at our disposal, therefore if a breach of data security that constitutes a risk to the rights of individuals occurs, we will notify the Responsible without further ado with all the relevant information to document and communicate the incident accordingly.
If applicable, at least the following information shall be provided:

A description of the potential consequences of the personal data security breach.
A description of the steps adopted or proposed to amend the personal data breach of security, including, when applicable, the actions taken to mitigate any adverse effects. If it is not possible to provide the information all at once, it will be provided gradually without undue delay.
g. As chosen by the Responsible, we will delete or return all the personal data collected once the provision of data-processing services has been completed and we will remove the existing copies too, unless personal data preservation is required by the Union or Member States.
h. We will supply all relevant information to the Responsible, in pursuance of the obligations established in art. 28 of the GDPR, thus allowing and contributing audits, inspections included, by the Responsible or another auditor authorized by the Responsible.
As data processors, the typology of data we can process on behalf of the Responsibles will be: identification data, personal characteristics data and academic and professional data, about teachers, students and legal representatives of the students. Regarding our data processing, these are the ones needed for Additio App proper operation, such as without limitation, the collection, organization, structuring, storage, preservation, queries, visualization and communication by transmission.

How do we process personal data?
We save and use your personal data only to process your orders and to get in touch with you. If you subscribe to our customer newsletter, we also use your email address to send the newsletter to you. We will automatically send you status messages from hetzner-status.de if you have previously changed your settings on our customer administration interface in which you request these messages. We also save and process data that job applicants provide us as part of the job application process.
What categories of data do we collect?
Every time you visit our website, your IP address and other pieces of information are saved in anonymized form. If you register an account with us, your contact information will be stored. If you order products from us, your address and payment information will also be stored.
In particular, we save the following data from you.
Registration data
When you register an account with us, we collect and process certain personal data from you as your registration data. For example, we need your name, address information, telephone number, payment information and your email address to process your order. If you pay using a credit card, we do not collect and store any payment information such as credit card numbers or verification codes. You disclose this information only to the respective payment service provider. One exception with credit card payments is what is known as the pseudo card number: in order for you not to have to enter your credit card information for every payment, a pseudo card number is saved for your account. The pseudo card number only enables payment for products on our website that you order using your customer account. A pseudo card number is not identical to the credit card number. We delete all your registration data either: within 24 months, as soon as you delete your user account with us, or once the statutory retention period expires. You can delete your user account with us by sending an email to
data-protection@hetzner.com
with your deletion request. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR.
Email addresses
If you subscribed to our newsletter, if someone invited you to a Hetzner Cloud project, or if you requested that you receive automated messages from
status.hetzner.com
, we also store your email address. We will delete your email address once you delete your user account or if you unsubscribe from our newsletter.
We use the double opt-in method to ensure that you actually want to receive the newsletter. If you go through this process, you agree to receive the newsletter and to be added to the mailing list for it, and then you will receive a confirmation email that will allow you to legally confirm that you have registered for the newsletter. We will only add your name to the mailing list if you actually complete the confirmation.
We use these data exclusively for sending information that you request including information about our new offers.
We use Brevo as our newsletter software. So if you agree to register for the newsletter, we will send your data to Sendinblue GmbH. Brevo is prohibited from selling your data and from using it for purposes other than sending our newsletter. Brevo is a German certified provider whom we chose because they must comply with the requirements of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).

The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR.

In particular, this may occur in the following cases:

To manage our job applications, we use software from rexx systems GmbH. We also have a data processing agreement with this company.
Third countries
Data is transferred to third countries in adherence to the legally regulated admissibility requirements. We will not transfer your data to a third country if it does not serve the purpose of performing our contract with you; if we have no consent from you; if the transfer is not necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims; and if there are no other exceptions. We will only transfer your data to a third country if there is an adequacy decision in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR or appropriate safeguards in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR.

State authorities and courts
Where do we process your data?
We process your data exclusively in our data centers in Germany and in Finland.
Using the “Ask AI” chatbot
1.	General information
We at Hetzner rely on advanced technologies to provide the best possible customer service. This is why we use the “Ask AI” chatbot. It can help to answer your questions about our products. The chatbot is operated by kapa.ai and uses technology like ChatGPT in the background. You can find more information at
https://www.kapa.ai
.
The chatbot completely automates the answers to your questions, and does so based on textual analysis and machine learning. The answers are based entirely on information that Hetzner has created itself, for example, information on Hetzner Docs.
We may need to make adjustments to the data protection policy for the chatbot as part of the continuous process for its improvement and further development. That’s why we recommend that you review this set of policies from time to time.
2.	Scope and legal basis for the data processing
The chatbot collects and uses any and all information that you provide it with to answer your questions.
You do not need to provide any personal data to use the chatbot.
To increase the protection and security of your data, we use a tool that automatically detects personal data. (Hereafter, we will refer to this tool as the “PII tool”; “PII” is short for personally identifiable information.) If you enter personal data in the chatbot, such as your name or your email address, the tool will automatically recognize it. The chatbot will then respond by asking you to enter your request/question again, but this time without personal data.
Important note: Despite our best efforts, we cannot completely guarantee that the PII tool will recognize personal data if you enter it in the chatbot.
If you have a question/request that requires you to include personal data, please instead write a support request at
https://accounts.hetzner.com
.
We process your data soley for the purpose of providing you with our services and to continually improve our services. The legal bases for the processing of your personal data in relation to the PII tool is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.
Kapa.ai uses the enterprise version of ChatGPT. The enterprise version of ChatGPT does not process personal data. You can find more information about this in ChatGPT’s privacy policy:
https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy
.
2.1 reCaptcha
When you use the chatbot, the tool reCaptcha is used. It is a tool that Google has developed, and it is used to make websites more secure. You can find more information about reCaptcha at
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/
. Google Fonts are loaded when you use the reCaptcha tool in the chatbot. You can find more information about Google Fonts at
https://fonts.google.com/about
.
3.	Data recipients / data transfer
Because the PII tool is in use, your data may be transferred to and processed using a server from kapa.ai Inc. which is located in the USA.
4.	Data storage and processing
The chatbot will store the complete chat history between you and the chatbot, and the time you used the chat (the date and time you accessed it) with kapa.ai after your question/request is processed. The chatbot will not ask you for your personal data and will not store any personal data that it recognizes.
We at Hetzner use the chat histories solely to monitor the quality of the chatbot’s responses, and to correct any mistakes. Your personal data will not be used for any training purposes for any large language models (LLMs). Any feedback that you provide about the chatbot’s answers will be used to improve future answers. We are constantly working to expand the database that the chatbot uses as part of our maintenance and review process.
5.	Cookies
In order to use the chatbot, you will need to accept all cookies. If you have only accepted the necessary cookies when you first accessed our website, you will be asked again whether you agree to the use of all cookies when you click on the “Ask AI” symbol. If you agree, these cookies will be used:
Session-Cookie
The session cookie is saved in the main memory of your device. The cookie contains an identifications number (session ID) as well as information about its origin and storage period. The cookie will only be stored for the duration of your visit to our website. After you leave our website, or after you close your broswer window, the cookie will be deleted.     
                The legal basis for the processing of this personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR because the session cookie is absolutely necessary for the chatbot to work.
Google-Cookies
When you use the chatbot, the tool Google reCaptcha will also be used (hereafter called “reCaptcha”). This is a service that is operated by Google Inc., whose address is: Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountainview, California 94043, USA (hereafter called “Google”). This service makes websites more secure because it checks to see if data that is entered comes from humans or from automated programs. This process runs automatically in the background when you access our website. It includes information such as your IP address and the duration of time that you spend on our website. That data is then sent to Google. You can find more information about reCaptcha at
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/
.   
                Google Fonts are loaded when you use the reCaptcha tool in the chatbot. You can find more information about Google Fonts at
https://fonts.google.com/about
.
                The legal basis for the processing of this personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR; the legitimate interest lies in preventing bad actors from spying on and spamming the chatbot.
You can find more information about how Google processes your data in Google’s privacy policies:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
.
If you are logged onto your Google account in the background while you visit our website, Google will use additional cookies. Please see Google’s privacy policies for more information on that.
6. Creation of log files
Information is automatically storied on kapa.ai’s servers while the chatbot is in use; this is to make the chatbot run more smoothly and to improve the chatbot. This information includes the date and time of day, whether or not access to the chatbot was successful, and the URL. This data is stored for a maximum of 30 days in a log file, and it may make it possible to identify you.
The legal basis for the processing of this personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR; the collection and storage of this data is absolutely necessary for the chatbot to work.
7. Security
Your data will be transferred to the chatbot using an HTTPS connection. We at Hetzner and kapa.ai take several technical and organizational measures to ensure that your personal data remains safe from unauthorized access by third parties.
Social media data
YouTube
