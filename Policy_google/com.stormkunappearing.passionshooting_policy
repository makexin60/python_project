Privacy Policy
DATE UPDATED: 12 May 2024
This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of Tres Studio so when we mention "Company", "we", "us" or "our" in this Privacy Policy.
We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and maintaining the confidence and trust of our customers. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how your personal information is collected, why it is collected and how it is kept secure. We are committed to complying with obligations under all applicable global data privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’), the California Consumer Privacy Act (‘CCPA’) (and any provincial substantially similar law as applicable).
A.INFORMATION WE COLLECT
a.Personal Information is any information about you, whether it is true or not, where your identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from that information. When anonymous information is directly or indirectly associated with personal information, the resulting information is also treated as Personal Information. Anonymous information means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual. Aggregate information means information about groups or categories of customers, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual customer.
b.We collect two basic types of information – Personal Information and anonymous information – and we may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information, aggregate information.
We collect:
①　contact details such as your first name and surname, email address, residential address and mobile or other phone numbers;
②　personal information such as gender, age, age range or your image; account login details, including your username, password and pictures associated with your profile;
③　information sent bilaterally or within a small group using email, post or other methods of communication;
④　information we obtain from a third party, such as a site or platform provider, about your use of or interest in our services;
⑤　location information including location information provided by a mobile or other device interacting with one of our Websites, or associated with your IP address, where we are permitted by law to process this information;
⑥　activity, technical and device information about your use of our Game, such as the content you view, the time and duration of your visit on our Game, how often you use our services, how you first heard about our Game, your preferences and information about your interaction with the content offered through our Game, your hardware model, device type, other unique device identifiers, operating system version, browser type and IP address; and
⑦　sensitive information such as biometric data, geolocation, drivers licenses and financial information to comply with our legal and regulatory purposes.
B.HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION

b.Information you provide to us directly including when you visit our Game, register on the Game, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Game.
c.In addition to collecting information via our Game, we collect information from you by telephone, video or in correspondence (including email, live chat, mail, text message or social media). All telephone or video calls between you and Company representatives may be recorded for training, quality control and compliance purposes and by continuing with any such call you consent to it being recorded.
d.We also collect information about your use of our products and services through a variety of technologies that are present when you visit our Websites, including the Game, or use our applications on third party sites or platforms (whether or not you are logged in or registered) including cookies, flash cookies, pixels, tags and application programming interfaces (“API”).

f.Finally, we also use trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided, or we have collected, including in order to verify or validate information (for example, postal address, documentation and names).
C.PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLGY
a.When you interact with our Game, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies.
b.Our Game may use technologies to enhance your experience. These technologies are small files that are placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other devices when you visit a website. They allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with the Game. Usage information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, device type, an estimate of your geographic location associated with your IP address, the location of your mobile device, the page served, the time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests. This statistical data provides us with information about your use of the services, such as general engagement with a page, the type of content on that page and how long you stay on that page. Usage information is generally non-identifying but if Company associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Company will treat it as Personal Information.
c.The following are examples of these types of technologies:
①　APIs. APIs work by allowing different types of software to communicate with each other. They make life a lot easier for programmers and provide a better experience for end users.
②　Cookies. These are small text files placed in your device browsers to store your preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the service may not work properly.
③　Event tagging. Event tagging allows us to track actions that occur on the Game such as application installs and purchase events. By tracking these events we can view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting.
④　Mobile device identifiers. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. It is used to identify your device for internet-based advertising. For instructions for using the advertising choice mechanisms provided by the most popular mobile operating systems, visit the NAI’s Mobile Choices page here.
⑤　Pixel tags/web beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Game that collects information about your engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on or forwarded.
