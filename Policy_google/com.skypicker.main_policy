Direct marketing
To provide you with the best offers and to maximize our marketing efficiency, we process your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing (sending commercial communication and related processing activities). We do so if you subscribed to our offers (on the basis of your consent) or if you used our services and have not rejected (opt-out) our offers. Besides your contact details, we also keep data like your transaction and travel history, travel preferences, and other data about your interaction with us that help us with customer segmentation and personalization of these offers. For example, we might tailor a special offer just for you based on your previous Bookings.
We will never share your contact details with other Data Controllers without your knowledge, and we will only contact you with offers that are linked to our main business.

Art 6.1(a) - consent.
You can always unsubscribe (exercise your right to object to direct marketing or withdraw your consent) and check your subscription status through the links below every email newsletter that you get from us.
Online advertisement
To provide you with the best offers and to maximize our marketing efficiency, we also display ads on Kiwi.com and third-party websites that are tailored for you based on your Personal Data. It might, therefore, happen that you will see advertisements that offer booking of transportation via Kiwi.com elsewhere on the internet.
Advertisement networks.
Besides our internal marketing database, we also use various third-party advertisement networks, such as Google Ads. These networks allow us to show you relevant ads on different places around the internet. This is done by assigning you an encrypted identifier and storing it in a cookie on your device. When you go to a website that is served ads via one of the companies working with our partner ad network, they will recognize this identifier and show you offers according to our specifications.
Targeting on third-party platforms.
To reach our users with our offers, we also use third-party platforms, such as Meta for Business or Google Ads. When you visit our website and book with us, we share an encrypted identifier (e.g. encrypted email address) with these platforms’ providers allowing them to match your profile on these platforms with our records. Because of this, we can show you tailored offers directly on these platforms using their advertising services. So, for example, if you search for a flight on Kiwi.com, don’t buy it, and the price goes down, we might show you an offer for this specific flight on third-party websites. These platforms are: Facebook (Meta for Business) by Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd, Google Search (Google Ads) by Google Ireland Limited, and TikTok by TikTok Technology Limited. If you don’t have a profile on these platforms, they won’t receive any information about you.
Lookalike features.
Some of the advertisement services which we use, namely Meta for Business and Google Ads, also provide the so-called “lookalike audiences” features. These features allow us to find users who might be interested in our services based on similarities to our existing users. We are then again able to target those users with our offers. This means that if you give us your consent, these services will analyze your profiles and find us other profiles based on common attributes. When using these features, we never gain direct access to any personal data or the profiles - this is all done by the service providers in the background and we only get the option to target our ads to a wider audience.

Customers
When you order any of our services, we will continue to process your Personal Data for the purposes explained above. The scope of the processed Personal Data for these purposes will, however, also include the Information about your Booking(s) and Information about your requests and your communication with us. Besides this, we will process your Personal Data for the following purposes:
NAME
DESCRIPTION
CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA
LEGAL GROUND
Ordering & Provision of services
The main reason we collect and use your Personal Data is to conclude an agreement with you and to provide you the services you have ordered. Depending on the extent to which you use our services, we will process your Personal Data in a way that is necessary to enter into and fulfill our Agreement as described in our Terms & Conditions. The services that we provide include, primarily, the brokering of a contract of carriage and related services between you and the selected carrier. We may also process your Personal Data for this purpose when providing you with the service of enforcement of your claims against carriers.
To achieve this purpose, we need to share your Personal Data with the carriers with whom you will enter into a contract of carriage and, in some cases, also with operators of ticket marketplaces, such as the Global Distribution Systems. Additionally, to pay for the tickets, we will use your name and surname to generate a single-use virtual payment card, which we use for the financial settlement with the transport provider.
If you order additional service Special assistance or when you ask us for a refund due to health issues, we will process your Personal Data concerning health. In the case of the Special assistance service, we will share it with the carrier of your choice. During the ordering process, you will be asked to give your explicit consent with the processing of this Personal Data. You can always withdraw your consent through this form: www.kiwi.com/privacy/rights. However, please note that if you withdraw the consent with the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of the Special Assistance additional service, we won’t be able to provide you with any subsequent support related to this service.
It may also happen that you choose to order another service that we or our partners offer on our website or in our app, such as insurance or accommodation. We will process your Personal Data as required to enter into a contract with you and to provide you with the ordered service or (if the service is provided by our partner) to enable you to enter into the contract with the service provider and to do our part in the contractual relationship between you and the third-party service provider.

Fraud prevention
When you book a ticket or order any other service through our website or app, during the payment transaction, we use a third-party service that helps us prevent fraudulent behavior. This is a very common process that happens nearly every time you order something online. For this to be possible, we will transfer your Personal Data momentarily to a third-party provider of fraud-checking service. However, this is not something to worry about, the whole transaction is completely secure, and we use one of the best and most common fraud-prevention tools. These third-party service providers (currently we use products from the company Forter, Inc. ) use the Personal Data, which they collect to build a database of online fraudulent behavior. They then compare this database with the behavior of the end-users of their clients. Whenever they detect similar behavioral signs, they can tell the clients to reject payments done by fraudsters.
Furthermore, to prevent attempts for fraudulent chargebacks, if you report fraudulent purchase through your bank, we might check your social media to see, whether you have some sort of connection to the person who ordered the ticket to make sure that it is not an attempt to get the money for the ticket back by fraud. We will only process limited information about your connection to the person, who ordered the ticket, and whether you, by any chance, have not published some information connected to the journey (e.g., photos from the airport taking a flight).

Customer support
Customer support is a big part of our services. We will record all of our communication through all channels, such as email, chat, and phone calls, in order to provide you with the service that you require. Part of our customer support is also helping our customers with potential legal issues with the carriers (in case of missed flights and similar situations). For this, we have partnered with a third-party service provider. When you have a legal problem, we will send this provider your email address, and you will be contacted with an offer to help you exercise your claims.  We also use third-party AI services to help our agents with the resolution of your cases. For example, when you contact us, we may use these tools to summarize the previous communication between you and other agents to have a quick overview of the case’s history. For certain requests, our AI assistant may provide an immediate response. In such cases, you will always be informed about the AI assistant’s involvement. If any action is taken by the AI assistant based on your request, you will be asked to confirm that action before it is finalized.

Similarly, if you send us a data protection request, we will also store all the data you give us and the data about our handling of the request for this purpose.

Compliance with legal obligations
We need to process some of your Personal Data to fulfill certain legal obligations that are applicable to us. Because this is a legal necessity, we do not need to obtain your consent for it. For this purpose, we will process your identification and contact information and information about your bookings. The main legal obligations we need to do this for arise from Act No. 89/2012 Coll, the Civil Code, Act No. 634/1992 Coll, on the protection of consumers, Act No. 235/2004 Coll, on Value Added Tax and Act. 563/1991 Coll, on Accounting. If you send us a data protection request to fulfill one of your rights, we will ask you for some personal data which we will then process to achieve compliance with the applicable law.

In general, we will process your Personal Data until we don’t need it for any of the purposes defined in this Privacy Policy.

For the purpose of your Kiwi.com user account, we will store your Personal Data for 5 years after the last action you performed by you while logged in.
For the purpose of personalized offers, you will periodically get email offers from us, and in every email, there will be a clear and easy way to unsubscribe and therefore object to this type of processing. We will keep and use your Personal Data for this purpose until you unsubscribe.
How to access and control your Personal Data?
We want you to always be in control of your Personal Data. To this end, you have certain rights that allow for it. Under certain conditions, you may:
gain access to all your data that we use or processing, and even get a copy of all of it,
ask us to delete your data,
correct the data that we are processing if you think that there are mistakes,
restrict the data processing,
object to processing,
receive your Personal Data in a commonly used and machine-readable format or to transmit this data to a different provider.

.

Access your Personal Data
At any time, you have the right to ask us whether we process your Personal Data and to get the following information:
Purposes for which we process your Personal Data,
Categories of your Personal Data we’re processing,
List of third-parties with whom we share your Personal Data, in particular when these third-parties are based in Third Countries
Duration that we plan to process your Personal Data, or at least how we determine the retention period
Your rights as a data subject according to the GDPR
Your right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
Where we received your data in cases where we didn’t get the data straight from you,
If applicable, any information about automated decision making that you may be subject to
When the data was transferred to a Third Country and what safeguards apply according to the GDPR
Also, on your request, we will provide you with a full copy of all the Personal Data about you that we’re processing. The first copy is for free. However, for any further copies we may charge you a fee to cover our administrative costs.
You can also request your data in a commonly used format for the sake of data portability.
Delete your Personal Data
You have also the right to have your data completely deleted (or more precisely, irreversibly anonymised) if one of the following situations applies to you:
we no longer need your Personal Data for any of the purposes defined in this Privacy Policy
you’ve successfully objected to the processing according to the Art. 21 of the GDPR and we have no other purpose for which we need your Personal Data,
we’ve processed your Personal Data unlawfully, or
there is a legal obligation that obliges us to delete your Personal Data.
However, you don’t have the right to request the deletion of your Personal data, if the processing is necessary for:
exercising the right of freedom of expression and information,
compliance with a legal obligation that obliges us to keep the Personal Data, or
we need the Personal Data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
Correct your Personal Data
If you feel that any Personal Data that we’re processing about you is not accurate, you can let us know and we will do our best to correct it.
Please note that we cannot correct the data in our databases that are connected to your ticket. If we would do that, it wouldn’t change it on the part of the carriers or providers of other services and we couldn’t pair it together. If you want to change the details on your ticket, you can always do it in the Manage My Booking section on Kiwi.com.
Restrict processing of your Personal Data
Under certain conditions, we will restrict the processing of your Personal Data. This means that we will make sure that they are not being processed for any other purpose than to archive it or to move it to a secure archive. You have the right to request this restriction if:
you challenged the accuracy of your Personal Data (we will continue processing it once this is resolved),
we’ve processed your Personal Data unlawfully but instead of deletion, you only request restriction,
the only remaining purpose for processing your Personal Data is the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or
you’ve objected to data processing according to the Art. 21 Para 1 of the GDPR and we’re assessing whether your request is justified
Object to processing of your Personal Data
You can object against any purpose for which we’re processing your Personal Data based on the legal ground of legitimate interest. When you object against processing for any marketing purposes, we will stop using your Personal Data for this purpose immediately.
If you protest against any other purpose based on a legitimate interest, we will stop processing your Personal Data for this purpose, unless we can prove that our legitimate grounds for processing it override your individual interests, rights and freedoms.
Get your Personal Data portable
Lastly, you have the right
to
obtain
your Personal Data processed (based on either consent or necessity for a conclusion or performance of a contract) in a commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right
to transmit
that data to another controller of your choice.

For transfers to recipients in countries where we cannot rely on the decision of the adequate level of protection according to Art. 45 of the GDPR or appropriate safeguards according to the Art. 46 of the GDPR, we will transfer your Personal Data based on the exception in the Art. 49 Para. 1 Lett. b) of the GDPR. Each selected carrier or service provider will treat Your Personal Data in accordance with its own Privacy Policy (which is published on every carrier’s website). Disclosure of Personal Data to other service providers will be done in accordance with the applicable Personal Data laws and regulations.

Privacy Policy of Kiwi.com
We at Kiwi.com take your privacy very seriously. Currently, we comply with the Regulation No. 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation, also known as
GDPR
, which sets the highest privacy and data protection standard in the world. In this Privacy Policy we explain what data we collect from you, why we collect it, how we use it and with whom we might share it. It also explains what rights you as a data subject have and how you can fulfill them.
This Privacy Policy applies to any data processing done by us in connection to the use of our services, both through our website
www.kiwi.com
and through our mobile applications for iOS and Android.

someone that determines the purposes and means of processing Personal Data. For example, we are a Data Controller when we process your Personal Data for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.If you choose to book a ticket through our website or app, we will be sending your Personal Data to another Data Controller – the carrier or the provider of other services – who will again use your Personal Data for its own purposes.

You can see the overview of Data Controllers with whom we might share the data below.
Data Processor:
a third party that only helps to achieve the purposes determined by the Data Controller. For example, we as a Data Controller use many third-party services to which we outsource some parts of our activities that we don’t do ourselves for various reasons such as cost-efficiency.

Direct marketing
To provide you with the best offers and to maximize our marketing efficiency, we process your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing (sending commercial communication and related processing activities). We do so if you subscribed to our offers (on the basis of your consent) or if you used our services and have not rejected (opt-out) our offers. Besides your contact details, we also keep data like your transaction and travel history, travel preferences, and other data about your interaction with us that help us with customer segmentation and personalization of these offers. For example, we might tailor a special offer just for you based on your previous Bookings.
We will never share your contact details with other Data Controllers without your knowledge, and we will only contact you with offers that are linked to our main business.

Art 6.1(a) - consent.
You can always unsubscribe (exercise your right to object to direct marketing or withdraw your consent) and check your subscription status through the links below every email newsletter that you get from us.
Online advertisement
To provide you with the best offers and to maximize our marketing efficiency, we also display ads on Kiwi.com and third-party websites that are tailored for you based on your Personal Data. It might, therefore, happen that you will see advertisements that offer booking of transportation via Kiwi.com elsewhere on the internet.
Advertisement networks.
Besides our internal marketing database, we also use various third-party advertisement networks, such as Google Ads. These networks allow us to show you relevant ads on different places around the internet. This is done by assigning you an encrypted identifier and storing it in a cookie on your device. When you go to a website that is served ads via one of the companies working with our partner ad network, they will recognize this identifier and show you offers according to our specifications.
Targeting on third-party platforms.
To reach our users with our offers, we also use third-party platforms, such as Meta for Business or Google Ads. When you visit our website and book with us, we share an encrypted identifier (e.g. encrypted email address) with these platforms’ providers allowing them to match your profile on these platforms with our records. Because of this, we can show you tailored offers directly on these platforms using their advertising services. So, for example, if you search for a flight on Kiwi.com, don’t buy it, and the price goes down, we might show you an offer for this specific flight on third-party websites. These platforms are: Facebook (Meta for Business) by Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd, Google Search (Google Ads) by Google Ireland Limited, and TikTok by TikTok Technology Limited. If you don’t have a profile on these platforms, they won’t receive any information about you.
Lookalike features.
Some of the advertisement services which we use, namely Meta for Business and Google Ads, also provide the so-called “lookalike audiences” features. These features allow us to find users who might be interested in our services based on similarities to our existing users. We are then again able to target those users with our offers. This means that if you give us your consent, these services will analyze your profiles and find us other profiles based on common attributes. When using these features, we never gain direct access to any personal data or the profiles - this is all done by the service providers in the background and we only get the option to target our ads to a wider audience.

When you order any of our services, we will continue to process your Personal Data for the purposes explained above. The scope of the processed Personal Data for these purposes will, however, also include the Information about your Booking(s) and Information about your requests and your communication with us. Besides this, we will process your Personal Data for the following purposes:
NAME
DESCRIPTION
CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA
LEGAL GROUND
Ordering & Provision of services
The main reason we collect and use your Personal Data is to conclude an agreement with you and to provide you the services you have ordered. Depending on the extent to which you use our services, we will process your Personal Data in a way that is necessary to enter into and fulfill our Agreement as described in our Terms & Conditions. The services that we provide include, primarily, the brokering of a contract of carriage and related services between you and the selected carrier. We may also process your Personal Data for this purpose when providing you with the service of enforcement of your claims against carriers.
To achieve this purpose, we need to share your Personal Data with the carriers with whom you will enter into a contract of carriage and, in some cases, also with operators of ticket marketplaces, such as the Global Distribution Systems. Additionally, to pay for the tickets, we will use your name and surname to generate a single-use virtual payment card, which we use for the financial settlement with the transport provider.
If you order additional service Special assistance or when you ask us for a refund due to health issues, we will process your Personal Data concerning health. In the case of the Special assistance service, we will share it with the carrier of your choice. During the ordering process, you will be asked to give your explicit consent with the processing of this Personal Data. You can always withdraw your consent through this form: www.kiwi.com/privacy/rights. However, please note that if you withdraw the consent with the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of the Special Assistance additional service, we won’t be able to provide you with any subsequent support related to this service.
It may also happen that you choose to order another service that we or our partners offer on our website or in our app, such as insurance or accommodation. We will process your Personal Data as required to enter into a contract with you and to provide you with the ordered service or (if the service is provided by our partner) to enable you to enter into the contract with the service provider and to do our part in the contractual relationship between you and the third-party service provider.

Fraud prevention
When you book a ticket or order any other service through our website or app, during the payment transaction, we use a third-party service that helps us prevent fraudulent behavior. This is a very common process that happens nearly every time you order something online. For this to be possible, we will transfer your Personal Data momentarily to a third-party provider of fraud-checking service. However, this is not something to worry about, the whole transaction is completely secure, and we use one of the best and most common fraud-prevention tools. These third-party service providers (currently we use products from the company Forter, Inc. ) use the Personal Data, which they collect to build a database of online fraudulent behavior. They then compare this database with the behavior of the end-users of their clients. Whenever they detect similar behavioral signs, they can tell the clients to reject payments done by fraudsters.
Furthermore, to prevent attempts for fraudulent chargebacks, if you report fraudulent purchase through your bank, we might check your social media to see, whether you have some sort of connection to the person who ordered the ticket to make sure that it is not an attempt to get the money for the ticket back by fraud. We will only process limited information about your connection to the person, who ordered the ticket, and whether you, by any chance, have not published some information connected to the journey (e.g., photos from the airport taking a flight).

Customer support
Customer support is a big part of our services. We will record all of our communication through all channels, such as email, chat, and phone calls, in order to provide you with the service that you require. Part of our customer support is also helping our customers with potential legal issues with the carriers (in case of missed flights and similar situations). For this, we have partnered with a third-party service provider. When you have a legal problem, we will send this provider your email address, and you will be contacted with an offer to help you exercise your claims.  We also use third-party AI services to help our agents with the resolution of your cases. For example, when you contact us, we may use these tools to summarize the previous communication between you and other agents to have a quick overview of the case’s history. For certain requests, our AI assistant may provide an immediate response. In such cases, you will always be informed about the AI assistant’s involvement. If any action is taken by the AI assistant based on your request, you will be asked to confirm that action before it is finalized.

We store and process your Personal Data to establish and exercise legal claims, or defend against them. Whenever you book a ticket or order any other service, we will keep all relevant data for potential future legal claims that you or we could have, especially in judicial and other proceedings and when recovering or selling claims you assigned to us, for at least 4 years from the point of the creation of the corresponding order. Similarly, if you send us a data protection request, we will also store all the data you give us and the data about our handling of the request for this purpose.

Compliance with legal obligations
We need to process some of your Personal Data to fulfill certain legal obligations that are applicable to us. Because this is a legal necessity, we do not need to obtain your consent for it. For this purpose, we will process your identification and contact information and information about your bookings. The main legal obligations we need to do this for arise from Act No. 89/2012 Coll, the Civil Code, Act No. 634/1992 Coll, on the protection of consumers, Act No. 235/2004 Coll, on Value Added Tax and Act. 563/1991 Coll, on Accounting. If you send us a data protection request to fulfill one of your rights, we will ask you for some personal data which we will then process to achieve compliance with the applicable law.

How to access and control your Personal Data?
We want you to always be in control of your Personal Data. To this end, you have certain rights that allow for it. Under certain conditions, you may:

to
obtain
your Personal Data processed (based on either consent or necessity for a conclusion or performance of a contract) in a commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right

Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area
If we need to, we may transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA. This will happen when you want to book a ticket with a carrier from a Third Country or when you order a service from a provider based in a Third Country. Naturally, we need to transfer your data to these third parties because without it, the provision of ordered services would not be possible. We may also transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA to Data Processors located in Third Countries.
For transfers to recipients in countries where we cannot rely on the decision of the adequate level of protection according to Art. 45 of the GDPR or appropriate safeguards according to the Art. 46 of the GDPR, we will transfer your Personal Data based on the exception in the Art. 49 Para. 1 Lett. b) of the GDPR. Each selected carrier or service provider will treat Your Personal Data in accordance with its own Privacy Policy (which is published on every carrier’s website). Disclosure of Personal Data to other service providers will be done in accordance with the applicable Personal Data laws and regulations.

We at Kiwi.com take your privacy very seriously. Currently, we comply with the Regulation No. 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation, also known as
GDPR
, which sets the highest privacy and data protection standard in the world. In this Privacy Policy we explain what data we collect from you, why we collect it, how we use it and with whom we might share it. It also explains what rights you as a data subject have and how you can fulfill them.

and through our mobile applications for iOS and Android.

We analyze all this data and use it to create or modify our features and processes. We use data also to grow our business.

The scope of the processed Personal Data will change depending on what details you decide to save. If you use third party SSO accounts (e.g., Facebook, Google) for signing into Kiwi.com Account, the account providers are informed about it and we obtain your Personal Data from them. Likewise, if you create your account through a website of some of our partners, we will receive the Personal Data from this partner.
We will use the data from your past Bookings to offer you to prefill some of the information for your future Bookings.
When making a Booking we can also prefill your Contact information from your Kiwi.com Account.

Direct marketing
To provide you with the best offers and to maximize our marketing efficiency, we process your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing (sending commercial communication and related processing activities). We do so if you subscribed to our offers (on the basis of your consent) or if you used our services and have not rejected (opt-out) our offers. Besides your contact details, we also keep data like your transaction and travel history, travel preferences, and other data about your interaction with us that help us with customer segmentation and personalization of these offers. For example, we might tailor a special offer just for you based on your previous Bookings.
We will never share your contact details with other Data Controllers without your knowledge, and we will only contact you with offers that are linked to our main business.

Art 6.1(a) - consent.
You can always unsubscribe (exercise your right to object to direct marketing or withdraw your consent) and check your subscription status through the links below every email newsletter that you get from us.
Online advertisement
To provide you with the best offers and to maximize our marketing efficiency, we also display ads on Kiwi.com and third-party websites that are tailored for you based on your Personal Data. It might, therefore, happen that you will see advertisements that offer booking of transportation via Kiwi.com elsewhere on the internet.
Advertisement networks.
Besides our internal marketing database, we also use various third-party advertisement networks, such as Google Ads. These networks allow us to show you relevant ads on different places around the internet. This is done by assigning you an encrypted identifier and storing it in a cookie on your device. When you go to a website that is served ads via one of the companies working with our partner ad network, they will recognize this identifier and show you offers according to our specifications.
Targeting on third-party platforms.
To reach our users with our offers, we also use third-party platforms, such as Meta for Business or Google Ads. When you visit our website and book with us, we share an encrypted identifier (e.g. encrypted email address) with these platforms’ providers allowing them to match your profile on these platforms with our records. Because of this, we can show you tailored offers directly on these platforms using their advertising services. So, for example, if you search for a flight on Kiwi.com, don’t buy it, and the price goes down, we might show you an offer for this specific flight on third-party websites. These platforms are: Facebook (Meta for Business) by Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd, Google Search (Google Ads) by Google Ireland Limited, and TikTok by TikTok Technology Limited. If you don’t have a profile on these platforms, they won’t receive any information about you.
Lookalike features.
Some of the advertisement services which we use, namely Meta for Business and Google Ads, also provide the so-called “lookalike audiences” features. These features allow us to find users who might be interested in our services based on similarities to our existing users. We are then again able to target those users with our offers. This means that if you give us your consent, these services will analyze your profiles and find us other profiles based on common attributes. When using these features, we never gain direct access to any personal data or the profiles - this is all done by the service providers in the background and we only get the option to target our ads to a wider audience.

When you order any of our services, we will continue to process your Personal Data for the purposes explained above. The scope of the processed Personal Data for these purposes will, however, also include the Information about your Booking(s) and Information about your requests and your communication with us. Besides this, we will process your Personal Data for the following purposes:
NAME
DESCRIPTION
CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA
LEGAL GROUND
Ordering & Provision of services
The main reason we collect and use your Personal Data is to conclude an agreement with you and to provide you the services you have ordered. Depending on the extent to which you use our services, we will process your Personal Data in a way that is necessary to enter into and fulfill our Agreement as described in our Terms & Conditions. The services that we provide include, primarily, the brokering of a contract of carriage and related services between you and the selected carrier. We may also process your Personal Data for this purpose when providing you with the service of enforcement of your claims against carriers.
To achieve this purpose, we need to share your Personal Data with the carriers with whom you will enter into a contract of carriage and, in some cases, also with operators of ticket marketplaces, such as the Global Distribution Systems. Additionally, to pay for the tickets, we will use your name and surname to generate a single-use virtual payment card, which we use for the financial settlement with the transport provider.
If you order additional service Special assistance or when you ask us for a refund due to health issues, we will process your Personal Data concerning health. In the case of the Special assistance service, we will share it with the carrier of your choice. During the ordering process, you will be asked to give your explicit consent with the processing of this Personal Data. You can always withdraw your consent through this form: www.kiwi.com/privacy/rights. However, please note that if you withdraw the consent with the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of the Special Assistance additional service, we won’t be able to provide you with any subsequent support related to this service.
It may also happen that you choose to order another service that we or our partners offer on our website or in our app, such as insurance or accommodation. We will process your Personal Data as required to enter into a contract with you and to provide you with the ordered service or (if the service is provided by our partner) to enable you to enter into the contract with the service provider and to do our part in the contractual relationship between you and the third-party service provider.

Fraud prevention
When you book a ticket or order any other service through our website or app, during the payment transaction, we use a third-party service that helps us prevent fraudulent behavior. This is a very common process that happens nearly every time you order something online. For this to be possible, we will transfer your Personal Data momentarily to a third-party provider of fraud-checking service. However, this is not something to worry about, the whole transaction is completely secure, and we use one of the best and most common fraud-prevention tools. These third-party service providers (currently we use products from the company Forter, Inc. ) use the Personal Data, which they collect to build a database of online fraudulent behavior. They then compare this database with the behavior of the end-users of their clients. Whenever they detect similar behavioral signs, they can tell the clients to reject payments done by fraudsters.
Furthermore, to prevent attempts for fraudulent chargebacks, if you report fraudulent purchase through your bank, we might check your social media to see, whether you have some sort of connection to the person who ordered the ticket to make sure that it is not an attempt to get the money for the ticket back by fraud. We will only process limited information about your connection to the person, who ordered the ticket, and whether you, by any chance, have not published some information connected to the journey (e.g., photos from the airport taking a flight).

Customer support
Customer support is a big part of our services. We will record all of our communication through all channels, such as email, chat, and phone calls, in order to provide you with the service that you require. Part of our customer support is also helping our customers with potential legal issues with the carriers (in case of missed flights and similar situations). For this, we have partnered with a third-party service provider. When you have a legal problem, we will send this provider your email address, and you will be contacted with an offer to help you exercise your claims.  We also use third-party AI services to help our agents with the resolution of your cases. For example, when you contact us, we may use these tools to summarize the previous communication between you and other agents to have a quick overview of the case’s history. For certain requests, our AI assistant may provide an immediate response. In such cases, you will always be informed about the AI assistant’s involvement. If any action is taken by the AI assistant based on your request, you will be asked to confirm that action before it is finalized.

We store and process your Personal Data to establish and exercise legal claims, or defend against them. Whenever you book a ticket or order any other service, we will keep all relevant data for potential future legal claims that you or we could have, especially in judicial and other proceedings and when recovering or selling claims you assigned to us, for at least 4 years from the point of the creation of the corresponding order. Similarly, if you send us a data protection request, we will also store all the data you give us and the data about our handling of the request for this purpose.

Compliance with legal obligations
We need to process some of your Personal Data to fulfill certain legal obligations that are applicable to us. Because this is a legal necessity, we do not need to obtain your consent for it. For this purpose, we will process your identification and contact information and information about your bookings. The main legal obligations we need to do this for arise from Act No. 89/2012 Coll, the Civil Code, Act No. 634/1992 Coll, on the protection of consumers, Act No. 235/2004 Coll, on Value Added Tax and Act. 563/1991 Coll, on Accounting. If you send us a data protection request to fulfill one of your rights, we will ask you for some personal data which we will then process to achieve compliance with the applicable law.
