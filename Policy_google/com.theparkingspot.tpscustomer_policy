1. Types of Information Collected
The Websites and Apps collect both personal information and non-personal or aggregate information from and about you.
“Personal information” is information by which you can be personally identified or contacted, and may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number(s), username, and credit/debit card number and related payment information. Personal information also may include information that may not be personally identifiable standing alone (for example, your reservation dates), but which may become personally identifiable when combined with personal information (for example, your reservation dates combined with your name). Many pages and features on our Websites and Apps can be visited and used without providing any personal information. For other pages, functionalities and services, you may be prompted or invited to provide certain personal information.
“Non-personal” or “aggregate” information is data that is about you but which does not identify you as an individual and is not linked to your personal information. This may include information such as your reservation dates, communication and other preferences, goods and services purchased and special requests made, information about your computer, devices and Internet connection when you use the Websites and Apps (such as your device type, browser type, IP address, and mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID), and certain information about your activities while using our Websites and Apps (such as your referring website, click stream data, the search terms you enter, your movement within and interaction with the Websites and Apps, the pages and features you access or visit on the Websites and Apps, the links and ads that you click, and the length of time you spend using the Websites and Apps). Non-personal information also may include personal information that has been de-identified, or in other words, rendered anonymous. For example, survey information that you volunteer may be anonymized and/or aggregated such that it no longer personally identifies you, and would then be considered non-personal or aggregate information. Non-personal information often is collected through the use of cookies, anonymous identifiers, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts, and other similar technologies. Click

3. How We Use Your Information
We may freely use non-personal information or aggregate information for any lawful purpose. We also may use your personal information for various purposes. In general, we use information, including personal information, from and about you:
To develop, deliver, provide and improve our Websites, Apps, services and content;
To accommodate your preferences and to customize your experience with our Websites and Apps;
To support and process the transactions, and provide the services and support, that you have requested;
To register and administer your membership in our loyalty programs;
To verify communications from you, respond to your inquiries and otherwise communicate with you;
For marketing and promotional purposes, including without limitation sending you promotional materials and offers that we believe may be of interest to you, and managing content and advertising;
To enforce our Terms and Conditions and contracts with third parties;
To send you important notices, such as communications about reservations and changes to our terms, conditions and policies (because this information is important to your interaction with The Parking Spot, you may not opt-out of receiving these communications);
To prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities or to otherwise comply with applicable laws and regulations;
To protect the security or integrity of our Websites, Apps, services and our business and to investigate actual and alleged claims against us;

For any other purpose that is permissible or required under the law, that is disclosed to you at the point of collection of personal information, or for which you provide your prior consent.
Payment information (i.e., credit or debit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, EPP code and billing address) is generally obtained only to process a specific transaction. However, members of our loyalty program may choose to link their membership card with a credit card to pre-fill online reservation forms and for convenience of payment. In either case, we only retain debit and credit card information in tokenized form. The Parking Spot may use IP addresses to provide aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Websites and Apps, to determine your general (but not precise) geographic location, to create and segment audiences and otherwise to target advertising, and to help identify and log potential malicious use of our Websites and Apps.
Our services may include certain features and services that may be available via your mobile phone, including, without limitation: (a) the ability to receive information and reply to messages via in-app push notifications, and to send content and messages using text messaging (Mobile Texts), and (b) the ability to access our services from your mobile phone (Mobile Web) (collectively, the "Mobile Services"). We do not charge for Mobile Services. Your carrier’s normal messaging, data and other rates and fees will still apply. Certain Mobile Services may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device. By using the Mobile Services you agree that we may communicate with you regarding the Website and our partners by in-app push notifications, SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to your mobile device and that certain information about your usage of the Mobile Services will be communicated to us. In connection with the Mobile Services we may send communications to your mobile device regarding us or other parties.
We reserve the right to combine personal information we collect on the Websites with data collected or received from other sources. If we combine any non-personal information with personal information that is covered by this Privacy Policy, the combined information will be treated as personal information pursuant to this Privacy Policy as long as it remains combined. We may store personal information for as long as needed for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy (which may be indefinitely) or for such period as may be permitted or required by law. We may anonymize information that we have collected or otherwise obtained and use that information in connection with interest-based advertising, to create audience segments and/or for other online advertising purposes. Non-personal information (including anonymized information and other non-personal information that is automatically collected as you navigate through and use the Websites and Apps) is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and we can use and share such information without restriction for any lawful purpose, including without limitation for business and marketing purposes.
ANCHOR: 4

Other third parties in order to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it (including without limitation your credit card issuer);
For any other purpose disclosed when you provide the information; and
Others with your consent.

5. Cookies and Other Technologies
The Parking Spot, its service providers, marketing partners, and other third parties may use cookies, either alone or in conjunction with anonymous identifiers, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts and other technologies, to obtain certain information about Website and App users. A "cookie" is a small text file that can be placed on your computer or other device when you visit a website or use an app. Cookies help to improve your user experience and allow us to analyze our Websites and Apps and to analyze and manage our advertising. While some cookies are deleted when you close your browser (session cookies), others remain even after you close your browsing session (persistent cookies). Cookies alone cannot be used to disclose your individual identity to us. Following are some of the types of cookies that may be used on the Websites and Apps:
Cookies that are necessary for the Websites and Apps to work and/or that enable you to navigate through and take advantage of our Websites, Apps, and their features;
Cookies to request HTTP header information in order to make our Websites function correctly, to personalize content presented to you, to better understand how our users use the Websites and Apps and how we can better serve your needs;

Cookies to track customer response to our advertisements and content;
Cookies that determine whether your browser is able to receive HTML email messages so that we can determine the appropriate format for you to receive and read email communications from us;
Analytics cookies to provide data about how users interact with Website and App content and advertising campaigns, such as how many people use our Websites and Apps, which pages and features they visit and use, how long they stay there, how visitors come to our Websites (e.g. through a link from another website or via a search engine), and also to collect information about how users use our Websites and Apps. Analytics cookies may be used alone or in conjunction with unique identifiers, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts, and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Websites and Apps or interact with our ads on other websites and apps.

Advertising Cookies to manage, target and serve ads through third-party advertising technology when you visit our Websites and use our Apps and when you visit other websites and use other apps.
Third parties, including advertising networks and other vendors, also may use anonymous identifiers, cookies, pixel tags, beacons, scripts, and other technologies, to track and collect information, including non-personal demographic information, about you and your interests and activities when you visit our Websites and other websites or view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on various websites or mobile platforms. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements and content on our Websites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. This is known as interest-based advertising. We allow third-party companies and others to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Websites and use our Apps. These companies may collect and use non-personal information (such as, for example, hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Demographic or other interest data may also be associated with your browsers or devices when you use the Websites and Apps, and such data may also be used online to serve you advertisements targeted based on your presumed interests.
We use Remarketing with Google Analytics and Google AdWords to show you our ads as you browse other websites around the Internet. The Remarketing service delivers our ads through the Google Display Network, which includes both Google.com pages and the sites of trusted publishers. Click

We also use information collected through cookies, anonymous identifiers, pixels, web beacons, scripts and other technologies to collect, analyze and segment data from websites and other sources to help us provide more effective advertising. For example, we may use data that is available from public or commercial sources and combine it with other data we have collected or received about a user or the user’s device. We work with third-party advertising service partners and platforms that help us provide more effective advertising by, for example, helping us to deliver ads to people who are most likely to be interested in seeing them, keep track of the number of users who saw a particular ad or visited a particular page on our Websites or Apps, and analyze the effectiveness of our ads. While the companies we work with may change from time to time, click on the following links to learn more about the practices of some of the companies we may work with and the choices they may offer with respect to advertising:
Lotame
,
LiveRamp
,
Adacado
and
The Trade Desk
.
Some digital advertising companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, each of which offer a single location to opt-out of certain ad targeting from member companies. To learn more about interest-based advertising generally as well as your options for opting out, please visit
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
or
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
. Please keep in mind that even if you opt out of receiving ads tailored to your apparent interests, you will continue to see ads from online advertising networks. However, those networks will not be able to apply any of your apparent ad preferences and the ads that you see therefore may be less relevant to your interests.
Social media cookies may be placed by social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.) for authentication purposes and/or to collect certain information about your visits to and use of our Websites and Apps through social media widgets. Such third-party social media sites are responsible for those cookies and how they process the data they collect and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the applicable third-party social media site before using their widgets or functionalities.
Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. For more information on how to manage browser cookies, see
http://www.allaboutcookies.org
. You also can check your mobile device’s built-in settings to find out how to turn off cookies on your mobile device. Some mobile devices also might store cookies in areas that are app-specific, which cannot be controlled by browser settings. Check your app settings options on your mobile device to find out how to manage or delete cookies that may be stores in these other areas. Please keep in mind, however, that you may not be able to access the full functionality of our Websites and Apps if cookies are disabled. Please also note that disabling or clearing cookies also may affect cookie-based opt-outs by either preventing you from using such cookie-based opt-outs or clearing opt-outs that you previously set, in which case you would have to revisit the applicable pages and renew your opt-out after clearing cookies.
The Parking Spot, its service providers and other third parties also may use web beacons and pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a web page. These technologies may be used, for example, to allow The Parking Spot and its service providers to send emails to you in a format you can read and to count users who have visited our Websites or used our Apps, seen our ads, opened our emails or clicked on any links in our emails. These technologies also may be used by The Parking Spot and its service providers to better target and personalize ads and to track ad campaigns. For example, pixel tags, web beacons and other technologies may allow third-party ad networks to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser or mobile device. This enables us to learn which ads bring users to our Websites and Apps. The information collected may tell the third-party ad network what other websites you have visited that are associated with the network. This information may be used for the purpose of managing, targeting and personalizing ads on our Websites and Apps and other websites and apps based on those interests.
We, our service providers and other third parties may analyze the information derived from cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts and other technologies and match or combine that information with data provided by you or collected or received from public and commercial sources. Please note that to the extent that third parties are using pixel tags, cookies, beacons, scripts or other tracking technologies on our Websites and Apps, The Parking Spot does not control the use of those technologies or the resulting information, the use of which are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.

6. Online Tracking / “Do Not Track” Signals
Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “Do Not Track” setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, and The Parking Spot does not respond to web browser “Do Not Track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe how we respond to such signals. We may work with third parties that use tracking technologies on the Websites and Apps, including in order to serve tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These and other third parties may collect information about your activity on the Websites and Apps and other websites and apps over time, as well as your interaction with our advertising and other communications, and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications based on your apparent interests, which is known as interest-based advertising. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit

You also can select one of our facilities from a drop down menu and, if you have enabled location services on your device and agree that you want to use those services, you also can use Google Maps to provide you turn-by-turn driving directions to The Parking Spot facility you have selected. Both the map and driving directions features are provided by Google Maps and it is your choice whether to use these features. We do not control Google Maps, and your use of that functionality is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy, as amended by Google from time to time, which can be reviewed
here
. Most mobile devices provide users the ability to disable location services, and you will need to enable location services for Google Maps if you wish to use that functionality on the mobile website or mobile application. Most likely, these controls are located in your device's settings menu.
Our TPS Shuttle App allows you to track the location of our parking shuttles at the airports we serve. To use this feature you must enable location services on your mobile device. If you choose to use this feature you are consenting to use of your geolocation data. Upon your consent, your geolocation (i.e., your latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates) will be sent from your device, allowing us to determine at which airport you are located. You are then prompted to select which of our facilities serving that airport you are using. We will use your geolocation information to show you a map of the real-time location of our parking shuttles serving the facility you are using and to locate you on our dispatch map so that we can see where and for how long you have been waiting for one of our shuttles. We do not associate your geolocation data with any personal information or share it with third parties other than to fulfill the purpose for which you provide your geolocation information.

tection of Personal Information
We take reasonable steps to protect against the unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration and destruction of the personal information under our control. For example, our servers are protected by reasonable physical and electronic security measures. We also encrypt data when you make a reservation through the Websites and certain Apps. Since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, the storage and communication of personal information can never be completely secure, including without limitation with respect to computer viruses, malicious software and hacker attacks. We therefore cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that information that you transmit to us, or any communications conducted on or through the Websites or Apps, is or will be totally secure. We are not responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access, and we make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise, that we will prevent such access. For your own privacy protection, we urge you to keep all passwords (including passwords that you may need to access certain portions of the Websites and Apps) confidential. We also recommend that you do not include any confidential or sensitive personal information in any emails that you send to us. If you become aware of any breach of the terms of this Privacy Policy or of the security of the Websites or Apps, please notify us.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services

A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about

For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
