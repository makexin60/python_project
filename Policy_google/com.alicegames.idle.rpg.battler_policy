Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the

Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.

Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Privacy Shield Notice
1. WHO WE ARE
Vungle is an ad network providing a technology platform (“
Platform
”) for Clients that want to advertise and/or monetize their applications, games, and other products. Our “
Clients
” include “
Advertisers
” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Platform, and “
Publishers
” of applications that want to display relevant ads to end users (“
End Users
“) of third party applications (“
apps
“) that use our SDKs, APIs, hosted video advertising platform and/or any of our related advertising tools (collectively, the “
Vungle Ad Services
“).
Advertising revenue helps keep many games and apps free, and Vungle works hard to ensure that our ads are interesting, relevant, and safe for End Users.
2. VUNGLE AD SERVICES
This Section describes how Vungle collects and uses information we receive from End Users (“
you
“) of apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.
2.1 What information do we collect?
When you use an app supported by Vungle technology (see Section 2.3,
below
, our services can collect certain information about your mobile device. Some of this information (including for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be “personal information” or “personal data” as defined under law in some jurisdictions (including in California and the EU, respectively) (hereinafter, collectively referred to as “
personal information
”). We collect this information the first time Vungle’s SDK is initialized on a Publisher Client’s app. Note, however, that Vungle’s Ad Services do not collect any information that that enables us to identify End Users personally (such as your name, address, or email address).
LEARN MORE
The information we collect includes:
Information about your device
, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address, Vungle SDK version, information about the Publisher Client’s app currently active on your device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer or Publisher Client’s app).
Information about your behavior on our Publisher Client’s app
, such as information about the activities or actions on those apps, and session start/stop time. Historic versions of Vungle technology may also collect geolocation information (e.g., latitude and longitude co-ordinates), but only (i) if the Publisher Client’s app has enabled location services on your device and (ii) you have granted the Publisher permission to collect this information). However, versions that are current as of the date of this Notice no longer collect geolocation information.
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on
, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, the number of times you have seen the ad, the number of Vungle ads viewed per session, and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.
We may also combine and/or enhance the information we collect about your device, including the personal information, with information we may collect about your interactions with other ads served through Vungle’s Platform that you may view on other Publisher Client’s Apps, or with information collected from our Clients and third parties (such as data providers). This may include, for example, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on an app to help make the ads served to you more relevant while limiting your exposure to less relevant ads. We (or our third party partners) may also use this additional information to undertake “user matching,” which means that in addition to the ID an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Clients have assigned to an End User.
2.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information, including the personal information, we collect (sometimes in combination with information provided and sourced by independent validation partners) for a variety of business purposes, including the following:
Serving Ads:
To allow Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their apps, and Advertisers to bid on and display ads in that inventory.
Ad Reporting and Conversions:
: To allow Vungle to confirm with Advertisers information about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website and to ensure accurate billing for advertising services rendered.
Frequency Capping:
Preventing End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.
Customizing Ads:
To customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to you and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting your exposure to less relevant ads).
Performance Analytics and Optimization:
To analyze and optimize ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, implementing end user “whitelists” or “blacklists” (to ensure, in some cases, that certain ads are being viewed by appropriate audiences), as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Fraud Detection and Prevention:
Identifying invalid clicks, installs, or ad queries, and protecting us and our Clients from fraudulent behavior.
Providing and Improving the Vungle Ad Services:
Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to provide, protect, and improve the Vungle Ad Services and to ensure that our technologies function properly.
2.3
How does Vungle use its technology to collect information
?
We use our technology (in some jurisdictions, such as the EU, these may be referred to as “tracking technologies”) to collect information automatically from your device to perform many of the functions described in “
How do we use your information?
” above. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions for opting out in the apps, as described in “
Opt-Out Choices
” below.
LEARN MORE
The standard tracking technologies we use include:
Mobile “SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” (including our own SDKs):
These are blocks of code that are embedded into an app allowing Vungle to collect certain information (as described in “
2.1 What information do we collect?
” above relating to your use of apps using our technology. The embedded code from Vungle’s SDK allows the app to “speak” with Vungle’s Platform for purposes of delivering ads.
Mobile device identifiers:
We also use standard device identifiers, for example the IDFA advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices and the GAID advertising identifier used on Android devices, to monitor and improve the performance of the ads we show you.
Third-Party Ad Measurement URLs/Links:
Additionally, in providing the Vungle Ad Services to our Advertiser Clients, the Vungle ads may include URLs or links from the Advertiser Client’s chosen third-party measurement partner to collect information about your interaction with those ads. The information collected is used for ad delivery, reporting, and billing purposes and may also be used for performance optimization.
“Tags and Pixels”:
These are blocks of code that we and our Clients may use to monitor your interaction with apps using our technology. We may use these to synchronize information that we have collected with information independently collected by our Clients and other third party advertising platforms and advertisers that are interested in providing you with ads.
2.4 Your Opt-Out Choices.
You can opt out of having your information being used by Vungle for performance-based advertising by accessing your mobile device settings and following the most recent published instructions. If you limit ad tracking, you will still see advertisements (even ones sourced from Vungle’s network), but Vungle will no longer be able to use the personal information described above in
Section 2.1
to serve you with more relevant ads. In addition, the advertising identifier (along with any information collected about that identifier) that was previously assigned to you will also be disassociated. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt back in, we will not be able to use any of your past information for advertising purposes, and you will (for all practical purposes) be a new user to our system. For apps using older versions of the Vungle SDK, you may also stop the collection of location information by particular apps that may allow collection of location of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
2.5 How Do We Share Information?
Please see Section 4.1,
below
for information concerning how Vungle shares the information collected.
2.6 Privacy Practices of Vungle Clients.
Vungle is not responsible for the information practices of our Clients or their agents. We require our Clients to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide End Users with notice of the collection of data for advertising purposes as outlined in this Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of apps you visit for information about those apps’ data collection and use practices.
2.7 Minors and Children.
Our Clients are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply with data privacy protection legislation applicable to minors and children, such as the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
“), including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information. With respect to COPPA specifically, we rely upon our Publisher Clients to confirm whether or not their app is subject to COPPA. As required by COPPA, Vungle will enable a flag in our system when a Client indicates their app is subject to COPPA such that the End User’s device history is disassociated, and the only End User personal information used by the Vungle Ad Services would be persistent identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) to provide “support for internal operations” of the Vungle Ad Services (as permitted by COPPA).
3. VUNGLE WEBSITES
This Section describes how we collect and use Information in the usual course of business, including through our websites (such as
“http://vungle.com”
or any other website on which this Notice is posted) and other corporate services, web portals, and dashboards we make available to our Clients and End Users (collectively “
Websites
“), as well as in connection with our events, sales and marketing activities. This section does not apply to information collection through apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.
3.1 What information do we collect?
Information that you provide voluntarily:
Certain parts of our Websites may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, when Clients are registering for a Vungle account, expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about Vungle or our products and services, subscribing to marketing or otherwise contacting us, Vungle collects required personal information from you. The personal information that you are asked to provide (and the reasons why you are asked to provide it) will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information. We will also let you know prior to collection whether the provision of personal information we are collecting is compulsory or may be provided on a voluntary basis, and the consequences (if any) of not providing the information. We also collect personal information you otherwise submit to us, such as when you send Vungle an email.
LEARN MORE
The personal information we collect may include contact information (such as your name, address, telephone number or email address) and contact preferences. It may also include professional information, such as your job title, department or job role, as well as the nature of your request or communication. We also collect information you choose to provide to us when completing any ‘free text’ boxes in our forms (for example, for event sign-up, product feedback or survey requests).
Information we collect automatically:
When using our Websites, we may automatically collect certain information from your device or computer. In some countries, including countries in the EU, this information may be considered personal information under data protection laws.Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include your IP address, your operating system, your browser ID, your browsing activity, and other information about your system and connection, and how you interact with our Websites and other websites. We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, as explained further under the heading “
Cookies and similar tracking technology
.”
Information we collect from third party sources:
We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, data providers, and social media platforms. Examples of the information we could receive from other sources include account information, page-views, and browsing information.
3.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information we collect or receive to:
Send you marketing and promotional communications.
For example, we and/or our third party marketing partners may use the personal information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing preferences. However, you will always be able to opt-out of our marketing at any time (see the “
Your Choices
” section above).
Send administrative information to you.
For example, to send you product, service, and new feature information and/or information about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.

4.4 Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA residents only).

4.5 Third-Party Websites and Apps.
This Notice only applies to the Vungle Websites and Vungle Ad Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of websites, developers, or apps that use or access the Vungle Services or Vungle Ad Services. In addition, ads within the Vungle Platform may contain links to third-party websites and apps. Any access to and use of such linked websites or apps is not governed by this Notice, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties.
4.6 How do we keep your personal information secure?
We use appropriate administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and to help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. Specific measures we will use include hashing and pseudonymization of data prior to storage. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you should take care in deciding what information you send us in this way.
4.7 Data Retention.
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such data or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If you are an End User, we typically store the personal information we collect about you, such as your IP address and other information described above, for 13 months from the date of last collection before we delete, overwrite, or anonymize that data, unless we are required to keep it to comply with a legal or audit obligation.
Please contact us at privacy@vungle.com if you have any questions about the information we collect and/or how we use the information we collect.

These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request. .

AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “AppLovin”) operates a suite of tools for app developers and other businesses to automate and optimize the marketing and monetization of their platforms, products, or services by enabling the placement of different types of advertisements on digital properties including mobile apps, websites, and connected TV devices (collectively, the “Advertising Services” or “Services”).  As explained below, consumers interact with us in a few ways, primarily through advertisements served by AppLovin on behalf of advertisers.
The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our Services and advertising platform, and our corporate website at www.applovin.com (the “Website”), as well as your choices related to that information.

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.
General Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer who downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services through advertisements served within a digital property, we may collect certain information, including the following:
Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;
Carrier;
Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);
Network connection type and speed;
IP Address;
Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services;
HTTP header information;
Advertising IDs (IDFA/GAID/Amazon FOSAID);
Vendor IDs (IDFV);
App Set IDs; and
Advertising and tracking preferences and restrictions.
Application publishers may choose to share with us additional information including your age or year of birth, gender, email, phone number, and interest segments for purposes of their own direct ad serving.  We do not retain this data or pass it downstream to advertising partners.  Please see the applicable publisher’s privacy policy for more information about their use of first party data.
Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here
, current as of the date listed at the top of that page.
If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, please see the
“Manage Your Privacy Choices”
section below. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or Switzerland, you may also see the
“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.

dataprotection@applovin.com
.
Data Security and Retention
We implement reasonable measures to help secure the information we collect through the Services. We retain the data we collect through the Services for up to 2 years.

Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals
If you are located in the European Union, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, the following additional provisions apply to you.
Data Privacy Framework
AppLovin complies with the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, AppLovin commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact AppLovin at
dataprotection@applovin.com
. AppLovin refers unresolved complaints to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
for more information or to file a complaint.  These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you.
For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website.
Lawful Basis for Processing
On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide services to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning our products and services.
On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers, where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
If the processing of your personal data is necessary, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you if there is no other lawful basis for such processing. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of personal data should be sent to us as specified in the “Contact” section below. Certain personal data, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, is considered “Sensitive Information”. AppLovin does not collect or seek to elicit “Sensitive Information”.
For questions about data processing, please contact our Data Protection Officer. Visit the “Contact” section below for contact information.
Your Rights
If you are an individual in the EU, UK, or Switzerland, you are able:
To request access to the personal data we hold about you;
To request that we rectify or erase your personal data;
To request that we restrict or block the processing of your personal data;
Under certain circumstances, to receive personal data about you that we store and transmit to another without hindrance from us, including requesting that we provide your personal data directly to another, i.e., a right to data portability; and
Where we previously obtained your consent, to withdraw consent to processing your personal data.
To exercise these rights, please contact us at the email address set forth in the
“Contact Us”
section below.  Our Data Protection Officer can also be reached at this email address.  Please be aware that we may be unable to afford these rights to you under certain circumstances, such as if we are legally prevented from doing so.
In certain circumstances, you may appoint an authorized agent to exercise any rights that you may have on your behalf.  If you choose to exercise any rights through an authorized agent, you will need to verify your identity directly with us before we can process any requests.  In addition, we will need written documentation demonstrating the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.
Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us. To do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.

Ár dtáirgí a fheabhsú agus a fhorbairt.
Ár dtáirgí a phearsantú agus moltaí a dhéanamh.
Fógraí agus margaíocht a dhéanamh leat, lena n-áirítear cumarsáidí fógraíochta, fógraíocht spriocdhírithe, agus tairiscintí ábhartha a sheoladh chugat.
Úsáidimid na sonraí, leis, chun ár ngnó a oibriú, lena n-áirítear ár bhfeidhmíocht a anailísiú, ár n-oibleagáidí dlíthiúla a chomhlíonadh, ár lucht saothair a fhorbairt, agus taighde a dhéanamh.
Agus na cuspóirí seo á gcur i gcrích, comhcheanglaímid sonraí a bhailímid ó chomhthéacsanna difriúla (mar shampla, ón úsáid a bhaineann tú as dhá tháirge Microsoft) nó a fhaighimid ó thríú páirtithe chun eispéireas níos leanúnaí, níos comhsheasmhaí agus níos pearsantaithe a thabhairt duit, chun cinntí eolacha gnó a dhéanamh, agus do chuspóirí dleathacha eile.
Cuimsíonn ár bpróiseáil ar shonraí pearsanta chun na gcríoch seo modhanna uathoibrithe próiseála agus modhanna láimhe (daonna). Is minic a thacaíonn ár modhanna láimhe lenár modhanna uathoibrithe agus go mbíonn gaol eatarthu. Mar shampla, chun cruinneas ár modhanna uathoibrithe próiseála (lena n-áirítear intleacht shaorga nó IS) a thógáil, a fhorbairt, agus a fheabhsú, déanaimid athbhreithniú láimhe ar chuid de na réamh-mheastacháin agus de na tátail a tháirgeann na modhanna uathoibrithe i gcomparáid leis na sonraí bunúsacha.
Mar chuid dár n-iarrachtaí chun ár dtáirgí a fheabhsú agus a fhorbairt, seans go mbainfimid úsáid as do shonraí chun ár samhlacha AI a fhorbairt agus a oiliúint. Tuilleadh eolais

Mar shampla, stórálaimid sonraí a bhailímid uait mura bhfuil tú fíordheimhnithe (gan a bheith sínithe isteach), ó aon fhaisnéis cuntais trína n-aithnítear thú go díreach, amhail d'ainm, do sheoladh ríomhphoist, nó d'uimhir fóin, nuair a cheanglaítear sin faoin dlí.
Cuimsíonn ár bpróiseáil ar shonraí pearsanta chun na gcríoch seo modhanna uathoibrithe próiseála agus modhanna láimhe (daonna). Is minic a thacaíonn ár modhanna láimhe lenár modhanna uathoibrithe agus go mbíonn gaol eatarthu. Mar shampla, chun cruinneas ár modhanna uathoibrithe próiseála (lena n-áirítear intleacht shaorga nó IS) a thógáil, a fhorbairt, agus a fheabhsú, déanaimid athbhreithniú láimhe ar chuid de na réamh-mheastacháin agus de na tátail a tháirgeann na modhanna uathoibrithe i gcomparáid leis na sonraí bunúsacha.
Mar chuid dár n-iarrachtaí chun ár dtáirgí a fheabhsú agus a fhorbairt, seans go mbainfimid úsáid as do shonraí chun ár samhlacha AI a fhorbairt agus a oiliúint. Tuilleadh eolais

Nuair a phróiseálaimid sonraí pearsanta bunaithe ar ár leasanna dlisteanacha nó iad siúd de thríú páirtí, smaoinímid orthu agus aimsímid cothromaíocht idir iad agus do chearta agus shaoirsí, agus ní phróiseálaimid do shonraí pearsanta ach nuair nár ba mhó do leasa féin ná leasanna dlisteanacha a bhfuil againn iad a phróiseáil.
Nuair a aistrímid sonraí pearsanta ón Limistéar Eorpach Eacnamaíoch, déanaimid amhlaidh bunaithe
ar mheicníochtaí dlí éagsúla, mar a thuairiscítear iad sa rannán Ina stórálaimid agus ina bpróiseálaimid sonraí pearsanta
den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Tuilleadh maidir le cuspóirí na próiseála:
Ár dtáirgí a sholáthar
. Úsáidimid sonraí chun ár dtáirgí a oibriú agus eispéiris shaibhre idirghníomhacha a sholáthar duit. Mar shampla, má úsáideann tú OneDrive, próiseálaimid na doiciméid a uaslódálann tú ar OneDrive chun gur féidir leat iad a aisghabháil, a scriosadh, a chur in eagar, a chur ar aghaidh nó a phróiseáil ar shlí ar bith eile, faoi do threoir, mar chuid den tseirbhís. Nó, mar shampla, má iontrálann tú iarratas cuardaigh in inneall cuardaigh Bing, úsáidimid an t-iarratas sin chun torthaí cuardaigh a thaispeáint duit. Lena chois sin, de bhrí gur gné de mhórchuid táirgí, ríomhchlár, agus gníomhaíochtaí iad cumarsáidí, úsáidimid sonraí chun teagmháil a dhéanamh leat. Mar shampla, is féidir go ndéanfaimid teagmháil fóin nó ríomhphoist leat nó teagmháil ar shlí éigin eile le hinsint duit go bhfuil síntiús ag dul in éag nó chun do chuntas ceadúnaithe a phlé. Bímid i dteagmháil leat, leis, chun ár dtáirgí a shlánú, mar shampla, trína insint duit go bhfuil nuashonrú táirge ar fáil.
Feabhsú táirge
. Bainimid úsáid as sonraí chun feabhas leanúnach a chur ar ár dtáirgí, lena n-áirítear gnéithe nó cumais nua a chur leis. Mar shampla, úsáidimid tuairiscí earráide chun gnéithe slándála a fheabhsú, úsáidimid iarratais chuardaigh agus cliceálacha in Bing chun ábharthacht na dtorthaí cuardaigh a fheabhsú, úsáidimid sonraí úsáide chun a fháil amach cad iad na gnéithe ar gá tosaíocht a thabhairt dóibh, agus úsáidimid sonraí gutha chun cruinneas na haitheanta cainte a fheabhsú.
Pearsantú
. Tá gnéithe pearsantaithe san áireamh i mórchuid táirgí, ar nós moltaí a fheabhsaíonn do tháirgiúlacht agus an taitneamh a bhaineann tú as. Úsáideann na gnéithe seo próisis uathoibrithe chun d'eispéiris táirge a shaincheapadh bunaithe ar na sonraí atá againn maidir leat, ar nós tátail mar gheall ort a bhainimid as an úsáid a bhaineann tú as táirgí, gníomhaíochtaí, ábhair spéis agus suíomh. Mar shampla, ag brath ar do shocruithe, má shruthaíonn tú scannáin i mbrabhsálaí ar do ghléas Windows, is féidir go bhfeicfidh tú moladh d'fheidhmchlár ó Microsoft Store a shruthaíonn ar shlí níos éifeachtaí. Má tá cuntas Microsoft agat, le do chead, is féidir linn do shocruithe a shioncronú ar ghléasanna éagsúla. Cuirtear rialuithe chun gnéithe pearsantaithe a dhíchumasú ar fáil i mórchuid dár dtáirgí.
Gníomhachtú táirge
. Bainimid úsáid as sonraí — cosúil le cineál an ghléis agus an fheidhmchláir, suíomh, agus aitheantóirí uathúla gléis, feidhmchláir, líonra agus síntiúis — chun táirgí a ghníomhachtú más gá sin.
Forbairt táirge
. Úsáidimid sonraí chun táirgí nua a fhorbairt. Mar shampla, úsáidimid sonraí, go minic tar éis iad a dhí-aithint, chun tuiscint níos fearr a fháil ar riachtanais ríofa agus táirgiúlachta ár gcustaiméirí agus múnlaí AI a mhionchoigeartú, ar féidir leo forbairt táirgí nua a mhúnlú.
Tacaíocht do chustaiméirí
. Bainimid úsáid as sonraí chun fadhbanna táirge a réiteach agus a dhiagnóisiú, gléasanna custaiméirí a dheisiú, agus seirbhísí cúraim agus tacaíochta do chustaiméirí eile a sholáthar, lena n-áirítear chun cabhrú linn cáilíocht ár dtáirgí, ár seirbhísí, agus ár n-oiliúint a sholáthar, a fheabhsú, agus a chinntiú agus chun teagmhais slándála a imscrúdú. Féadfar sonraí taifeadta glaonna a úsáid freisin chun tú a fhíordheimhniú nó a aithint bunaithe ar do ghuth chun gur féidir le Microsoft seirbhísí tacaíochta a sholáthar agus teagmhais slándála a imscrúdú.
Cabhraigh le slándáil agus fabhtcheartú
. Úsáidimid sonraí mar chabhair chun ár dtáirgí a dhéanamh slán agus a fhabhtcheartú. Áirítear ar sin sonraí a úsáid chun slándáil agus sábháilteacht ár dtáirgí agus ár gcustaiméirí a chosaint, gníomhaíochtaí bogearraí mailíseacha agus gníomhaíochtaí mailíseacha a bhrath, fadhbanna feidhmiúlachta agus comhoiriúnachta a fhabhtcheartú chun cabhrú le custaiméirí gach buntáiste a bhaint as a n-eispéireas, agus nuashonruithe ar ár dtáirgí a fhógairt do chustaiméirí. Is féidir go bhfuil córais uathoibrithe chun fadhbanna slándála agus sábháilteachta a bhrath san áireamh ansin.
Sábháilteacht
. Úsáidimid sonraí chun sábháilteacht ár dtáirgí agus ár gcustaiméirí a chosaint. Is féidir lenár ngnéithe agus ár dtáirgí slándála cur isteach ar an oibriú bogearraí mailíseacha agus úsáideoirí a chur ar an eolas má aimsítear bogearraí mailíseacha ar a ngléasanna. Mar shampla, cuid dár dtáirgí, cosúil le Outlook.com nó OneDrive scan, inneachar ar bhealach uathoibríoch chun turscar, víreas, mí-úsáid, nó URLanna amhrasta a aithint ar cuireadh bratach leo mar naisc chalaoise, fioscaireachta nó bogearraí mailíseacha; agus coimeádaimid an ceart chun bac a chur ar sheachadadh cumarsáide nó inneachar a bhaint má sháraíonn sé ár dtéarmaí.
I gcomhair leis an Rialachán Eorpach Aontais (AE) 2021/1232, ghlaogamar an chuma a cheadaítear leis an Rialachán sin ar Airteagail 5(1) agus 6(1) de Threoir 2002/58/CE AN AE. Bainimid úsáid as teicneolaíochtaí scanta chun sínithe digiteacha (a tugtar “haiseanna” orthu) de híomhánna agus inneachar físeáin ar ár gcórais a chruthú. Cuireann na teicneolaíochtaí sin na haiseanna a ghineann siad i gcomparáid le haiseanna dúshrathacht ghnéasach leanaí a tuairiscíodh agus mí-úsáid íomhánna (ar a dtugtar tacar haise ), i bpróiseas ar a dtugtar “meaitseáil haise”. Faigheann Microsoft tacair haiseanna ó heagraíochtaí a ghníomhaíonn ar leas an phobail i gcoinne drochúsáid ghnéasach leanaí. D'fhéadfaí comhroinnt faisnéise leis an Lárionad Idirnáisiúnta do Leanaí ar Iarraidh agus Leanaí a ndéantar Dúshaothrú Orthu (NCMEC) agus leis na húdaráis um fhorfheidhmiú an dlí dá thoradh sin.
Nuashonruithe
. Úsáidimid sonraí a bhailímid chun nuashonruithe táirge agus paistí slándála a fhorbairt. Mar shampla, is féidir go n-úsáidfimid faisnéis faoi chumas do ghléis, ar nós na cuimhne atá ar fáil, chun nuashonrú bogearraí nó paiste slándála a chur ar fáil duit. Tá nuashonruithe agus paiscí ceaptha le d'eispéireas lenár dtáirgí a uasmhéadú, cabhrú leat príobháideacht agus slándáil do shonraí a chosaint, gnéithe nua a sholáthar, agus measúnú a dhéanamh cibé an bhfuil nó nach bhfuil do ghléas réidh chun nuashonruithe dá leithéid a phróiseáil.
Cumarsáidí fógraíochta
. Úsáidimid sonraí a bhailímid chun cumarsáidí fógraíochta a sheachadadh. Is féidir leat clárú le haghaidh síntiúis ríomhphoist agus roghnú cibé an mian leat cumarsáidí fógraíochta a fháil ó Microsoft i ríomhphost, SMS, post fisiceach, agus guthán. Chun faisnéis a fháil faoi do shonraí teagmhála, síntiúis ríomhphoist agus cumarsáid bolscaireachta a bhainistiú, féach ar an rannán

den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Tairiscintí ábhartha
. Úsáideann Microsoft sonraí chun faisnéis ábhartha agus luachmhar maidir lenár dtáirgí a sholáthar duit. Déanaimid anailís ar shonraí ó fhoinsí éagsúla chun an fhaisnéis is mó a gcuirfidh tú spéis inti agus a bhainfidh leat a thuar agus an fhaisnéis sin a chur ar fáil duit ar shlite éagsúla. Mar shampla, is féidir go dtuarfaimid do spéis i gcluichíocht agus go gcuirfimid cumarsáidí chugat i dtaobh cluichí nua a thaitneodh leat, b'fhéidir.
Fógraíocht
. Ní úsáideann Microsoft an méid a deir tú i ríomhphoist, comhráite duine le duine, glaonna físeáin ná glórphost, ná do dhoiciméid, grianghraif ná comhaid phearsanta eile chun fógraíocht a dhíriú ort. Bainimid úsáid as sonraí a bhailímid trínár n-idirghníomhaíocht leat, trí roinnt dár dtáirgí, ár sheirbhísí, ár bhfeidhmchláir agus ár n-airíonna gréasáin céadpháirtí (airíonna Microsoft), agus ar airíonna Gréasáin tríú páirtí, chun fógraí a thaispeáint inár dtáirgí Microsoft agus ar airíonna tríú páirtí. Is féidir go n-úsáidfimid próisis mar chabhair chun an fhógraíocht a dhéanamh níos ábhartha maidir leat. Tá tuilleadh faisnéise faoin úsáid a bhaintear as do chuid sonraí le haghaidh fógraíocht le fáil sa rannán
Fógraíochta
den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Promóisin agus imeachtaí duaiseanna
. Úsáidimid do chuid sonraí chun promóisin agus ócáidí duaiseanna atá ar fáil inár Microsoft Store fisiciúil a riar. Mar shampla, má iontrálann tú promóisean duaiseanna, d’fhéadfaimis do chuid sonraí a úsáid chun buaiteoir a roghnú agus an duais a chur ar fáil duit má bhíonn an bua agat. Nó, má chláraíonn tú le haghaidh ceardlann chódúcháin nó ócáid chluichíochta, cuirfimid d’ainm le liosta an lucht freastail a bhfuil súil leis.
Tráchtáil beartaíochta
. Úsáidimid sonraí chun gur féidir leat bearta a dhéanamh linn. Mar shampla, próiseálaimid faisnéis íocaíocht chun síntiúis táirge a sholáthar do chustaiméirí agus úsáidimid faisnéis teagmhála chun earraí a cheannaítear ó Microsoft Store a sheachadadh.
Tuairisciú agus oibríochtaí gnó
. Úsáidimid sonraí chun ár n-oibríochtaí a anailísiú agus léargais ghnó a fháil. Cuireann sé sin ar ár gcumas cinntí eolacha a dhéanamh agus tuairisciú ar fheidhmíocht ár ngnó.
Cearta agus maoin a chosaint
. Úsáidimid sonraí chun calaois a bhrath agus a chosc, díospóidí a réiteach, comhaontuithe a fheidhmiú agus ár maoin a chosaint. Mar shampla, úsáidimid sonraí chun deimhniú a thabhairt ar bhailíocht ár gceadúnas bogearraí chun píoráideacht a laghdú. Is féidir go n-úsáidfimid uathphróisis chun gníomhaíochtaí a sháraíonn ár gcearta agus cearta daoine eile, ar nós na calaoise, a bhrath agus a chosc.
Comhlíonadh an dlí
. Próiseálaimid sonraí chun an dlí infheidhme a chomhlíonadh. Mar shampla, úsáidimid aois ár gcustaiméirí chun cabhrú linn ár n-oibleagáidí chun príobháideacht leanaí a chosaint.

Na fáthanna a gcomhroinnimid sonraí pearsanta
Comhroinnimid d'fhaisnéis phearsanta le do chead nó chun aon bhearta a chríochnú nó chun aon táirge atá iarrtha nó údaraithe agat a sholáthar. Comhroinnimid sonraí, freisin, le fochuideachtaí agus le cleamhnaithe faoi rialú Microsoft; le díoltóirí a oibríonn ar ár son; nuair a cheanglaítear é faoin dlí nó chun freagairt do phróiseas dlí; chun ár gcustaiméirí a chosaint; chun beatha daoine a chosaint; chun slándáil ár dtáirgí a choinneáil; agus chun cearta agus maoin Microsoft agus a chustaiméirí a chosaint.
Tabhair faoi deara, mar a shainmhínítear faoi dhlíthe príobháideachta sonraí stáit áirithe de chuid na S.A., go mbaineann “comhroinnt” le sonraí pearsanta a sholáthar do thríú páirtithe chun críocha fógraíochta pearsantaithe. Féach an rannán
Príobháideachais Sonraí Stáit SAM
thíos agus ár
bhFógra Dlíthe Príobháideachais Stáit SAM
chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil.
Roinnimid d'fhaisnéis phearsanta má thugann tú an cead sin dúinn, nó más gá chun gnó éigin a chríochnú agus i gcás táirge a d'iarr tú nó a d'údaraigh tú a sholáthar duit. Mar shampla, comhroinnimid d'inneachar le tríú páirtithe nuair a thugann tú ordú dúinn, ar nós nuair a chuireann tú ríomhphost chuig cara, nuair a chomhroinneann tú grianghraif agus doiciméid ar OneDrive, nó nuair a nascann tú cuntais le seirbhís eile. Má úsáideann tú táirge Microsoft curtha ar fáil ag eagraíocht a bhfuil tú comhcheangailte léi, amhail fostóir nó scoil, nó má úsáideann tú seoladh r-phoist atá curtha ar fáil ag eagraíocht dá leithéid chun rochtain a fháil ar tháirgí Microsoft, comhroinnimid sonraí áirithe, cosúil le sonraí idirghníomhaíochta agus sonraí diagnóiseacha chun d'eagraíocht a chumasú chun na táirgí a bhainistiú. Nuair a thugann tú sonraí íocaíochta dúinn le rud éigin a cheannach, d’fhéadfadh le Microsoft do chuid Sonraí íocaíochta a roinnt le bainc agus aonáin eile a phróiseálann idirbhearta íocaíochta nó le seirbhísí airgeadais eile, agus d’fhonn calaois a chosc agus riosca creidmheasa a laghdú. Ina theannta sin, nuair a shábhálann tú modh íocaíochta (cosúil le cárta) chuig do chuntas a úsáideann tú féin agus sealbhóirí cuntais Microsoft eile chun ceannacháin a dhéanamh ó Microsoft nó óna chleamhnaithe, féadfar d’admhálacha ceannacháin a chomhroinnt le haon duine eile a úsáideann agus a bhfuil rochtain aige ar an modh íocaíochta céanna chun ceannachán a dhéanamh ó Microsoft, lena n-áirítear sealbhóir cuntais ainmnithe an mhodha íocaíochta. Nuair a cheadaíonn tú brúfhógraí do tháirgí nó feidhmchláir Microsoft ar gléas nach bhfuil ó Windows, próiseálfaidh córas oibriúcháin an ghléis sin sonraí phearsanta áirithe chun brúfhógraí a sholáthar. Dá réir sin, is féidir le Microsoft sonraí a sheoladh chuig soláthraí fógra tríú-pháirtí seachtrach chun brúfhógraí a sholáthar. Tá seirbhísí brúfhógraí do ghléis faoi réir a dtéarmaí sainseirbhíse agus a bpolasaithe príobháideachais féin.
Lena chois sin, roinnimid sonraí pearsanta chun críocha fógraíochta digití. Nuair a thugann tú cuairt ar shuíomh gréasáin nó nuair a úsáideann tú feidhmchlár ar mian leis fógraí a thaispeáint duit, d'fhéadfadh an mhaoin dhigiteach ligean do Microsoft rochtain a fháil ar shonraí gléis nó ar shonraí áirithe eile a shainaithnítear sa rannán Sonraí Pearsanta a bhailímid thuas. Féadfaimid an fhaisnéis sin a roinnt ansin le hardáin fógraíochta tríú páirtí agus le fógróirí chun seachadadh agus tomhas fógraí ar airíonna digiteacha den sórt sin a éascú.  Féach na rannáin maidir le Príobháideachas Sonraí Fógraíochta agus Stáit na Stát Aontaithe thíos chun tuilleadh eolais a fháil faoin gcaoi a n-úsáidtear do shonraí le haghaidh fógraíochta.
Chomh maith leis, roinnimid sonraí pearsanta le fochuideachtaí agus cleamhnaithe faoi rialú Microsoft. Roinnimid freisin sonraí pearsanta le díoltóirí atá ag obair dúinn leis na cuspóirí atá cur síos orthu sa ráiteas seo. Mar shampla, is féidir go mbeidh d'fhaisnéis phearsanta ag teastáil ó chomhlachtaí atá fostaithe againn chun seirbhís custaiméara a sholáthar nó chun cabhrú chun ár gcórais agus seirbhísí a choinneáil sábháilte, chun na feidhmeanna sin a sholáthar. I gcásanna mar sin, is gá do na comhlachtaí sin cloí leis na riachtanais phríobháideachta agus slándála atá againn agus ní cheadaítear dóibh úsáid eile a bhaint as an bhfaisnéis phearsanta uainn. D'fhéadaimis d'fhaisnéis phearsanta a nochtadh mar chuid d'idirbheart corparáideach ar nós cumasc nó díol sócmhainní.
Ar deireadh, déanfaimid do shonraí pearsanta a choimeád, a rochtain, a aistriú, a nochtadh, agus a chaomhnú, lena n-áirítear d'inneachar (amhail a bhfuil i do ríomhphoist in Outlook.com, nó comhaid i bhfillteáin phríobháideacha ar OneDrive), nuair a chreidimid de mheon maith gur gá sin chun aon cheann díobh seo a leanas a dhéanamh:
Cloí leis an dlí is infheidhme nó freagairt do phróiseas bailí dlí, lena n-áirítear ó ghníomhaireachtaí forfheidhmithe dlí nó gníomhaireachtaí eile rialtais.
Cosain sábháilteachtn ár gcustaiméirí agus an phobail — mar shampla, le coisc a chur ar thurscar nó iarrachtaí chun calaois a dhéanamh nó dochar eile a dhéanamh, nó le iompar neamhdhleathach a aimsiú lena n-áirítear ábhar neamhdhleathach nó dochrach a chruthú nó a roinnt.
Ár dtáirgí a choinneáil ag obair agus iad a choimeád slán, lena n-áirítear ionsaí ar ár ríomhchórais nó líonraí a chosc nó a stopadh.
Cearta nó maoin Microsoft a chosaint, lena n-áirítear na téarmaí a rialaíonn úsáid na seirbhísí a fhorghníomhú—d'ainneoinn sin, má fhaighimid faisnéis a léiríonn go bhfuil ár seirbhísí in úsáid ag duine éigin chun maoin intleachta nó fhisiciúil ghoidte de chuid Microsoft a gháinneáil, ní dhéanfaimid cigireacht ar inneachar príobháideach custaiméara muid féin, ach is féidir go gcuirfimid ar aghaidh chuig lucht fhorfheidhmiú an dlí é.
Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil faoi na sonraí a nochtaimid mar fhreagairt ar iarratais ó ghníomhaireachtaí forfheidhmithe dlí agus gníomhaireachtaí rialtais eile, féach ar ár
Tuarascáil ar Iarratais Forfheidhmithe Dlí

Tabhair faoi deara go bhfuil naisc i gcuid dár dtáirgí chuig táirgí de chuid tríú páirtithe nó go gcumasaíonn siad duit rochtain a fháil ar tháirgí de chuid tríú páirtithe nach ionann a gcleachtais phríobháideachta agus cleachtais phríobháideachta Microsoft. Má chuireann tú sonraí pearsanta ar fáil d'aon cheann de na táirgí sin, beidh do shonraí faoi réir a bpolasaithe príobháideachais.

Do shainroghanna cumarsáide
Is féidir leat roghnú más mian leat cumarsáidí fógraíochta a fháil ó Microsoft le ríomhphost, SMS, post fisiceach agus guthán. Má fhaigheann tú ríomhphoist nó SMS fógraíochta uainn agus ba mhaith leat iad a dhiúltú amach anseo, tig leat é sin a dhéanamh trí na treoracha sa teachtaireacht sin. Is féidir leat, freisin, roghanna a dhéanamh faoi cibé an nglacfaidh tú le ríomhphoist fógraíochta, glaonna fóin agus comhfhreagras poist ach síniú isteach le do chuntas Microsoft pearsanta, agus féachaint ar do
cheadanna cumarsáide
áit is féidir leat d'fhaisnéis teagmhála a nuashonrú, sainroghanna teagmhála ar fud Microsoft a bhainistiú, díliostáil ó do shíntiúis ríomhphoist, agus roghnú cibé an gcomhroinnfidh tú d’fhaisnéis teagmhála le comhpháirtithe Microsoft nó nach gcomhroinnfidh. Mura bhfuil cuntas pearsanta Microsoft agat, is féidir leat do shainroghanna teagmhála ríomhphoist Microsoft a bhainistiú trí úsáid a bhaint as an
bhfoirm ghréasáin
seo. Ní bhaineann na roghanna sin le cumarsáid riachtanach seirbhíse atá mar chuid de tháirgí, chláir nó ghníomhaíochtaí Microsoft, ná le suirbhéanna ná le míreanna cumarsáide faisnéise eile a bhfuil a modh díliostála féin acu.
Do roghanna fógraíochta
Chun díliostáil ó fhógraíocht pearsantaithe ó Microsoft, lena n-áirítear Xandr, a fháil, téigh chuig an leathach
díliostála
dár gcuid. Nuair a dhíliostálann tú, déantar do shainrogha a stóráil i gcuach a bhaineann go sonrach leis an mbrabhsálaí Gréasáin atá in úsáid agat. Gabhann dáta éaga cúig bliana leis an gcuach díliostála. Má scriosann tú na cuacha ar do ghléas, beidh ort díliostáil arís.
Is féidir leat, freisin, do rogha díliostála a nascadh le do chuntas Microsoft pearsanta. Beidh feidhm aici ansin ar ghléas ar bith ar a n-úsáideann tú an cuntas sin, agus beidh feidhm aici i gcónaí go dtí go sínítear isteach le cuntas Microsoft pearsanta eile ar an ngléas sin. Má scriosann tú na cuacha ar do ghléas, beidh ort síniú isteach arís leis na socruithe a chur i bhfeidhm. Is féidir leat amharc ar
ár gcomhpháirtithe fógraí tríú páirtí
ar
Fhógra Dlíthe Príobháideachais Sonraí Stáit SAM
, agus díliostáil ó chomhroinnt na sonraí le tríú páirtithe ar an
leathanach díliostála
.
Maidir le fógraíocht faoi rialú Microsoft a fheictear i bhfeidhmchláir ar Windows, is féidir leas a bhaint as an rogha díliostála atá nasctha le do chuntas Microsoft pearsanta, nó díliostáil ó fhógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéise tríd an ID fógraíochta i socruithe Windows a chasadh as.
Ós rud é go n-úsáidtear na sonraí a úsáidtear i gcás fógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéise le haghaidh cuspóirí riachtanacha eile (lena n-áirítear ár dtáirgí a sholáthar, anailísíocht agus brath calaoise) ní chiallaíonn díliostáil ó fhógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéise nach mbaileofar na sonraí sin. Gheobhaidh tú fógraí, ach seans nach mbeidh siad chomh bainteach leat.
Is féidir leat díliostáil ó fhógraí bunaithe ar ábhair spéise a fháil ónár gcomhpháirtithe tríú páirtí ach dul chuig a suíomhanna Gréasáin (féach thuas).
Rialuithe bunaithe ar bhrabhsálaí
Nuair a úsáideann tú brabhsálaí, is féidir leat do shonraí pearsanta a rialú le gnéithe áirithe. Mar shampla:
Rialuithe fianán
. Is féidir leat na sonraí a stóráiltear le fianáin a rialú agus toiliú le cuacha a aistarraingt trí leas a bhaint as na rialuithe fianáin bunaithe ar bhrabhsálaí a bhfuil cur síos orthu sa rannán
Fianáin
den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Cosaintí rianaithe
. Féadfaidh tú na sonraí ar féidir le suíomhanna tríú páirtí a bhailiú fút a rialú trí leas a bhaint as Cosaint ar Rianú in Internet Explorer (leagan 9 agus leaganacha níos déanaí) agus Microsoft Edge. Is féidir bac a chur ar ábhar tríú páirtí leis an ngné sin, lena n-áirítear cuacha, ó aon suíomh atá liostaithe ar Liosta um Chosaint ar Rianú a chuireann tú leis.
Rialuithe brabhsálaí do "Ná Rianaigh."
Tá gnéithe "Ná Rianaigh" (DNT) mar chuid de roinnt brabhsálaithe ar féidir leo comhartha a sheoladh chuig na suíomhanna gréasáin a dtugann tú cuairt orthu ag cur in iúl nach bhfuil fonn ort go rianófar thú. De bhrí nach bhfuil comhthuiscint ann fós ar an tslí leis an gcomhartha Ná Rianaigh a léirmhíniú, ní fhreagraíonn seirbhísí Microsoft comharthaí Ná Rianaigh ó bhrabhsálaithe. Leanfaimid de dhul i mbun oibre leis an tionscal ar líne chun comhthuiscint ar conas caitheamh le comharthaí Ná Rianaigh a shainiú. Idir an dá linn, is féidir úsáid a bhaint as na huirlísí eile a chuirimid ar fáil chun bailiú agus úsáid sonraí a rialú, lena n-áirítear an cumas diúltú d'fhógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéise ó Microsoft, mar a thuairiscítear thuas.

Cuacha agus teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla
Is comhaid téacs bheaga iad cuacha a chuirtear ar do ghléas chun sonraí a stóráil, ar féidir le freastalaí Gréasáin iad a léamh san fhearann a chuir an chuach ann. Úsáidimid cuacha agus teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla chun do shainroghanna agus do shocruithe a stóráil agus chun cloí leo, rud a chuireann ar do chumas síniú isteach, agus a chumasaíonn dúinn fógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéis a sheoladh, dul i ngleic le calaois, anailís a dhéanamh ar fheidhmíocht ár dtáirgí, agus cuspóirí dlisteanacha eile a chomhlíonadh. Baineann feidhmchláir Microsoft úsáid as aitheantóirí breise, amhail an ID fógraíochta i Windows, a ndéantar cur síos air sa rannán
ID fógraíochta
Windows den ráiteas príobháideachais seo, chun críocha comhchosúla.
Bainimid úsáid freisin as “rabhcháin Ghréasáin” chun cuacha a sheoladh agus sonraí úsáide agus feidhmíochta a bhailiú. Is féidir go gcuirfidh ár suíomhanna idirlíne rabhcháin, fianáin, nó teicneolaíochtaí atá cosúil le chéile ó chleamhnaithe agus comhpháirtithe chomh le tríú páirtí, mar shampla soláthraí seirbhísí ag gníomhú ar ár son san áireamh.
D'fhéadfadh na nithe seo a leanas a bheith san áireamh le fianáin tríú páirtí: Deartar fianáin mheán sóisialta chun fógraí agus inneachar bunaithe ar do phróifíl meán sóisialta agus do ghníomhaíocht ar ár suíomhanna a thaispeáint duit; fianáin anailísíochta chun tuiscint níos fearr a fháil ar an dóigh a úsáideann tú agus daoine eile ár suíomhanna ionas gur féidir linn iad a fheabhsú, agus ionas gur féidir le tríú páirtithe a gcuid táirgí agus seirbhísí féin a fheabhsú; fianáin Fógraíochta chun fógraí atá ábhartha duit a thaispeáint duit; agus fianáin Riachtanacha a úsáidtear chun feidhmeanna suímh ghréasáin bunriachtanacha a dhéanamh. Nuair is gá, faighimid do thoiliú sula gcuirtear nó úsáidimid fianáin roghnacha nach bhfuil (i) fíor-riachtanach chun an suíomh gréasáin a sholáthar; nó (ii) chun cumarsáid a éascú.
Féach ar an rannán Tuilleadh faisnéise thíos chun faisnéis ar ár úsáid fianáin tríú pháirtí, rabhcháin gréasáin agus seirbhísí anailísíochta, agus teicneolaíochtaí atá cosúil leo ar ár suíomhanna agus seirbhísí. Chun liosta a fháil de na tríú páirtithe a shocraíonn fianáin ar ár suíomhanna gréasáin, soláthraithe seirbhíse atá ag feidhmiú ar ár son san áireamh, tabhair cuairt ar ár bhfardal
fianán tríú páirtithe
. Ar chuid dár suíomhanna gréasáin, tá liosta tríú páirtithe ar fáil go díreach ar an suíomh. Is féidir nach mbeidh na tríú páirtithe ar na suíomhanna seo san áireamh leis an liosta ar ár
bhfardal fianáin tríú páirtí
.
Tá uirlisí éagsúla agat chun na sonraí arna mbailiú ag cuacha, rabhcháin Ghréasáin, agus teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla a rialú. Mar shampla, féadfaidh tú leas a bhaint as na rialtáin i do bhrabhsálaí idirlín chun an bealach ina n-úsáideann na suíomhanna Gréasáin ar a bhféachann tú cuacha agus is féidir leat do thoiliú a aistarraingt trí bhac a chur ar chuacha nó iad a ghlanadh.
Is comhaid téacs bheaga iad cuacha a chuirtear ar do ghléas chun sonraí a stóráil, ar féidir le freastalaí Gréasáin iad a léamh san fhearann a chuir an chuach ann. Is teaghrán uimhreacha agus litreacha a bhíonn sna sonraí sin go minic, lena ndéantar do ríomhaire féin a aithint go huathúil, ach is féidir faisnéis eile a bheith in éineacht leis chomh mhaith. Cuireann tríú páirtithe atá ag gníomhú ar ár son roinnt cuach i bhfeidhm. Úsáidimid cuacha agus teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla chun do shainroghanna agus do shocruithe a stóráil agus chun cloí leo, rud a chuireann ar do chumas síniú isteach, agus a chumasaíonn dúinn fógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéis a sheoladh, dul i ngleic le calaois, anailís a dhéanamh ar fheidhmíocht ár dtáirgí, agus cuspóirí dlisteanacha eile a chomhlíonadh a bhfuil cur síos orthu thíos. Úsáideann feidhmchláir Microsoft aitheantóirí eile, cosúil leis an ID fógraíochta in Windows, le haghaidh cuspóirí comhchosúla, agus tá rabhcháin Ghréasáin nó teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla i mórchuid dár suíomhanna Gréasáin agus dár bhfeidhmchláir, mar a luaitear thíos.
An úsáid a bhainimid as cuacha agus teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla
Baineann Microsoft úsáid as cuacha agus as teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla le haghaidh cuspóirí éagsúla, ag brath ar an gcomhthéacs nó ar an táirge, lena n-áirítear:
Do shainroghanna agus socruithe a stóráil
. Úsáidimid cuacha chun do shainroghanna agus socruithe a stóráil ar do ghléas, agus chun feabhas a chur ar d'eispéiris. Mar shampla, ag brath ar do chuid socruithe, má chuireann tú do chathair nó cód poist isteach chun nuacht áitiúil nó faisnéis faoin aimsir a fháil ar shuíomh gréasáin de chuid Microsoft, déanaimid na sonraí sin a stóráil i gcuach, ionas go bhfeicfidh tú an fhaisnéis áitiúil chuí nuair a fhillfidh tú ar an suíomh. Má dhéantar do shainroghanna a shábháil le cuacha, amhail do theanga shainroghnaithe, ní bheidh ort do shainroghanna a shocrú arís is arís eile. Má dhíliostálann tú ó fhógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéise, stórálaimid do shainrogha díliostála i gcuach ar do ghléas. Mar an gcéanna, i gcásanna ina bhfaighimid cead uait cuacha a chur ar do ghléas, déanaimid an rogha a dhéanann tú a stóráil i gcuach.
Síniú isteach agus fíordheimhniú
. Úsáidimid cuacha le fíordheimhniú gur tusa atá ann. Nuair a shíníonn tú isteach i suíomh Gréasáin le do chuntas Microsoft pearsanta, déanaimid uimhir ID uathúil, agus an t-am a shínigh tú isteach a stóráil i gcuach criptithe ar do ghléas. Ligeann an fianán seo duit bogadh ó leathanach go leathanach ar an suíomh gan síniú isteach arís ar gach leathanach. Chomh maith leis sin, féadfaidh tú d'fhaisnéis sínithe isteach a shábháil ionas nach mbeidh ort síniú isteach gach uair a fhilleann tú ar an suíomh.
Slándáil
. Féadfaimid cuacha a úsáid chun faisnéis a phróiseáil a chabhraíonn linn ár gcuid táirgí a choimeád slán, mar aon le calaois agus mí-úsáid a bhrath.
Faisnéis a sholáthraíonn tú do shuíomh Gréasáin a stóráil
. Úsáidimid cuacha chun faisnéis a chomhroinn tú a choimeád i gcuimhne. Nuair a sholáthraíonn tú faisnéis do Microsoft, mar shampla nuair a chuireann tú táirgí le cairt siopadóireachta ar shuíomhanna Gréasáin Microsoft, déanaimid na sonraí a stóráil i gcuach le cuimhneamh ar an bhfaisnéis sin.
Meáin shóisialta
. Tá cuacha meán sóisialta ar chuid dár suíomhanna Gréasáin, lena n-áirítear cuacha a chuireann ar chumas úsáideoirí atá sínithe isteach sa tseirbhís meán sóisialta inneachar a chomhroinnt tríd an tseirbhís sin.
Aiseolas
. Baineann Microsoft úsáid as cuacha chun tú a chumasú chun aiseolas a sholáthar ar shuíomh Gréasáin.
Fógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéise
. Úsáideann Microsoft cuacha chun do ghníomhaíocht ar líne agus do shuimeanna a aithint ionas gur féidir linn an fhógraíocht is ábhartha duit a sholáthar. Is féidir leat díliostáil ó fhógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéise a fháil ó Microsoft mar a thuairiscítear sa rannán
Conas do shonraí pearsanta a rochtain agus a rialú
den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Fógraíocht a thaispeáint
. Baineann Microsoft úsáid as fianáin chun líon na gcuairteoirí a chliceálann ar fhógra a thaifeadadh agus chun na fógraí atá feicthe agat a thaifeadadh, mar shampla, ionas nach dtaispeántar an ceann céanna duit arís agus arís eile.
Anailísíocht
. Bainimid úsáid as cuacha agus aitheantóirí eile, céad pháirtí agus tríú páirtí, chun sonraí úsáide agus feidhmíochta a bhailiú. Mar shampla, bainimid feidhm as cuacha chun líon na gcuairteoirí uathúla chuig leathanach gréasáin nó seirbhís a áireamh nó chun staidrimh eile a fhorbairt maidir le hoibriú ár dtáirgí.
Feidhmíocht
. Úsáideann Microsoft cuacha le tuiscint a fháil ar fheidhmíocht ár dtáirgí agus le feabhas a chur orthu. Mar shampla, úsáidimid cuacha le sonraí a bhailiú a chabhraíonn le cothromú lóid; cabhraíonn sé sin lena chinntiú go bhfanann ár suíomhanna Gréasáin faoi shiúl.
Nuair is gá, faighimid do thoiliú sula gcuirtear nó úsáidimid fianáin roghnacha nach bhfuil (i) fíor-riachtanach chun an suíomh gréasáin a sholáthar; nó (ii) chun cumarsáid a éascú. Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a tháil, féach ar an rannán “Conas fianáin a rialú”.
Tá cuid de na cuacha is coitianta a úsáidimid liostaithe thíos. Ní liosta uileghabhálach é, ach tá sé ann chun na príomhchúiseanna lena socraímid cuacha a léiriú. Má thugann tú cuairt ar cheann dár suíomhanna gréasáin, socróidh an suíomh cuid de na cuacha seo, nó gach ceann díobh:
MSCC
. Sa cheann seo tá roghanna an úsáideora don chuid is mó d’airíonna Microsoft.
MUID, MC1, MSFPC, agus MSPTC
. Aithnítear brabhsálaithe uathúla gréasáin leo a thugann cuairt ar shuíomhanna de chuid Microsoft. Baintear úsáid as na cuacha seo chun críocha fógraíochta, anailísíocht suíomhanna agus cuspóirí oibríochtúla eile.
ANON
. Tá an ANID ann, arb aitheantóir uathúil é ó do chuntas Microsoft, a úsáidtear le haghaidh cuspóirí fógraíochta, pearsantaithe agus oibríochtúla. Aidhm eile atá leis ná do rogha chun diúltú d'fhógraíocht bunaithe ar ábhair spéise ó Microsoft a chaomhnú má roghnaigh tú an diúltú a nascadh le do chuntas Microsoft.
CC
. Tá cód tíre inti a cinneadh ó do sheoladh IP.
PPAuth, MSPAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth, WLSSC, MSPProf
. Cabhraíonn siad leat a fhíordheimhniú nuair a shíníonn tú isteach le do chuntas Microsoft.
MC0
. Braitear léi cibé an bhfuil cuacha cumasaithe sa bhrabhsálaí.
MS0

Fianáin tríú páirtí
Chomh maith leis na fianáin a shocraíonn Microsoft nuair a thugann tú cuairt ar ár suíomhanna, is féidir linn fianáin ó tríú pháirtithe chomh maith chun ár seirbhísí a fheabhsú ar ár suíomhanna. Is féidir le roinnt tríú pháirtí fianáin a shocrú nuair a thugann tú cuairt ar suíomhanna Microsoft. Mar shampla:
Na cuideachtaí a fhostaímid chun seirbhísí a sholáthar ar ár son, amhail anailísíocht ar shuíomh, déanann siad cuacha a shocrú nuair a théann tú chuig ár suíomhanna.
Is féidir le cuideachtaí a dhéanann ábhar a sheachadadh, amhail físeáin, nuacht, nó fógraí, ar shuíomhanna Microsoft fianáin a shocrú ar a suíomhanna féin.
Úsáideann na cuideachtaí sin na sonraí a phróiseálann siad de réir a bpolasaithe príobháideachais, lena gcumasófaí do na cuideachtaí sin faisnéis faoi do ghníomhaíochtaí ar shuíomhanna Gréasáin, feidhmchláir, nó seirbhísí ar líne éagsúla a bhailiú agus a chur le chéile.
B’fhéidir go n-úsáidfear na cineálacha fianán tríú pháirtí a leanas, ag brath ar an gcomhthéacs, ar an seirbhís nó ar an dtáirge, chomh maith le do shocruithe agus ceadanna:
Fianáin Mheáin Shóisialta.
Úsáidimid, agus úsáideann tríú páirtithe, fianáin ó na meáin shóisialta chun fógraí agus inneachar a thaispeáint duit bunaithe ar na próifílí atá agat ar na meáin shóisialta agus do chuid gníomhaíochta ar ár suíomhanna gréasáin. Úsáidtear iad le nasc a dhéanamh idir do chuid gníomhaíochta ar ár suíomhanna gréasáin agus na próifílí atá agat ar na meáin shóisialta sa dóigh is go mbeidh na fógraí agus an t-inneachar a fheiceann tú ar ár suíomhanna gréasáin agus ar na meáin shóisialta ag teacht níos fearr leis an suimeanna atá agat.
Fianáin anailísíochta.
Tugaimid cead do thríú páirtithe fianáin anailísíochta a úsáid chun tuiscint níos fearr a fháil ar an gcaoi a úsáideann tú ár suíomhanna gréasáin, ionas gur féidir linn iad a fheabhsú agus gur féidir leis na tríú páirtithe á dtáirgí a fhorbairt agus a fheabhsú, a bhféadfaidís úsáid a bhaint astu ar shuíomhanna gréasáin nach le Microsoft iad agus nach ndéanann Microsoft iad a oibriú. Mar shampla, úsáidtear fianáin anailísíochta chun faisnéis a bhailiú maidir leis na leathanaigh a dtugann tú cuairt orthu agus cá mhéad clic atá de dhíth ort chun tasc a chur i gcrích. D’fhéadfaí na cuacha sin a úsáid fosta chun críocha fógraíochta.
Fianáin fógraíochta.
Úsáidimid agus úsáideann tríú páirtithe fianáin fógraíochta chun fógraí nua a thaispeáint duit ach taifead a dhéanamh de na fógraí atá feicthe agat cheana féin. Úsáidtear iad fosta chun na fógraí a gcliceálann tú orthu - nó na nithe a cheannaíonn tú i ndiaidh cliceáil ar fhógra - a rianú chun críocha íocaíochta, agus le fógraí a thaispeáint duit atá níos feiliúnaí duitse. Mar shampla, úsáidtear iad le brath cén uair a chliceálann tú ar fhógra agus chun fógraí a thaispeáint duit bunaithe ar do chuid suimeanna sna meáin shóisialta agus ar an stair bhrabhsála atá agat ó thaobh suíomhanna gréasáin de.
Fianáin riachtanacha.
Úsáidimid fianáin riachtanacha chun feidhmeanna suímh ghréasáin riachtanacha a dhéanamh. Mar shampla, chun thú a logáil isteach, do chuid sainroghanna teanga a shábháil, eispéireas tralaí siopadóireachta a thabhairt, feidhmíocht a fheabhsú, trácht a ródú idir freastalaithe gréasáin, méid do scáileáin a bhrath, agaí lódála leathanach a mheas, agus luchtanna féachana a thomhas. Tá na cuacha seo riachtanach le go bhfeidhmeoidh ár suíomhanna gréasáin.
Nuair is gá, faighimid do thoiliú sula gcuirtear nó úsáidimid fianáin roghnacha nach bhfuil (i) fíor-riachtanach chun an suíomh gréasáin a sholáthar; nó (ii) chun cumarsáid a éascú.
Chun liosta a fháil de na tríú páirtithe a shocraíonn fianáin ar ár suíomhanna gréasáin, soláthraithe seirbhíse atá ag feidhmiú ar ár son san áireamh, tabhair cuairt ar ár
bhfardal fianán tríú páirtithe
. Tá naisc chuig suíomhanna tríú pháirtí nó fógraí príobháideachais curtha san áireamh sa fardal fianán tríú pháirtí chomh maith. Téigh i gcomhairle leis na suíomhanna tríú pháirtí nó na fógraí príobháideachta le tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil ar a cleachtais príobháideachta maidir lena fianáin arbh fhéidir bheith socruithe ar ár suíomhanna gréasáin. Ar chuid dár suíomhanna gréasáin, tá liosta tríú páirtithe ar fáil go díreach ar an suíomh. Is féidir nach mbeidh na tríú páirtithe ar na suíomhanna seo san áireamh leis an liosta ar ár
bhfardal fianán tríú páirtí
.
Conas cuacha a rialú
Glacfaidh formhór na mbrabhsálaithe Gréasáin le cuacha ach cuireann siad rialuithe ar fáil a cheadaíonn duit iad a bhacadh nó a scriosadh. Mar shampla, in Microsoft Edge, is féidir leat fianáin a bhacadh nó a scriosadh trí
Socruithe
>

>  a roghnú
Glan sonraí brabhsála

. Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil faoi conas d'fhianáin a scriosadh i mbrabhsálaithe Microsoft, féach
Microsoft Edge
,
Oidhreacht Microsoft Edge
, nó
Internet Explorer
. Más brabhsálaí eile atá in úsáid agat, féach treoracha an bhrabhsálaí sin.
Mar a luadh thuas, nuair is gá, faighimid do thoiliú sula gcuirtear nó úsáidimid fianáin roghnacha nach bhfuil (i) fíor-riachtanach chun an suíomh gréasáin a sholáthar; nó (ii) chun cumarsáid a éascú. Déanann na cuacha roghnacha seo a scaradh de réir feidhme, amhail críocha a bhaineann le fógraíocht nó leis na meáin shóisialta. Is féidir leat cead a thabhairt i gcás catagóirí áirithe de na cuacha roghnacha agus diúltú i gcás catagóirí eile. Is féidir leat do roghanna a athrú chomh maith ach “Bainistigh cuacha” a chliceáil sa bhuntásc den suíomh gréasáin nó sna socruithe a chuirtear ar fáil ar an suíomh gréasáin. Tá gnéithe áirithe de tháirgí Microsoft ag brath ar chuacha. Má roghnaíonn tú bac a chur ar chuacha, ní bheidh tú in ann síniú isteach ná cuid de na gnéithe sin a úsáid, agus caillfear sainroghanna a bhraitheann ar chuacha. Má roghnaíonn tú cuacha a scriosadh, déanfar aon socruithe agus sainroghanna atá á rialú ag na cuacha sin, lena n-áirítear sainroghanna fógraíochta, a scriosadh agus is féidir go mba ghá iad a athchruthú.
Déantar cur síos ar rialuithe príobháideachais eile ar féidir tionchar a bheith acu ar fhianáin, lena n-áirítear an ghné chosaintí rianaithe de bhrabhsálaithe Microsoft, sa rannán

An úsáid a bhainimid as rabhcháin Ghréasáin agus seirbhísí anailísíochta
D'fhéadfadh clibeanna leictreonacha ar a dtugtar rabhcháin Ghréasáin a bheith i leathanaigh Ghréasáin áirithe Microsoft. Úsáidimid iad sin le cabhrú chun cuacha a sheachadadh ar ár suíomhanna Gréasáin, chun líon na gcuairteoirí na suíomhanna sin a chomhaireamh, agus chun seirbhísí comhbhrandáilte a chur ar fáil. Áirímid rabhcháin Ghréasáin nó teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla inár gcumarsáid leictreonach freisin le fáil amach cibé an osclaíonn tú iad agus an ngníomhaíonn tú dá réir.
Chomh maith le rabhcháin ghréasáin a chur inár suíomhanna Gréasáin féin, uaireanta oibrímid le comhlachtaí eile a chuireann ár rabhcháin ina suíomhanna Gréasáin nó i bhfógraí dá gcuid. Cabhraíonn sé sin linn, mar shampla, staitisticí a fhorbairt ar a mhinice a bhíonn ceannach nó gníomh eile ar shuíomh Gréasáin fógróra ina thoradh ar chliceáil ar fhógra ar shuíomh Gréasáin de chuid Microsoft. Tugann sé tuiscint dúinn ar do ghníomhaíocht ar shuíomh gréasáin de chuid comhpháirtí Microsoft maidir leis an úsáid a bhaineann tú as táirge nó seirbhís Microsoft.
Faoi dheireadh, bíonn rabhcháin nó teicneolaíocht eile ó sholáthraithe anailísíochta tríú páirtí i dtáirgí Microsoft freisin, a chabhraíonn linn staitisticí comhbhailithe a chur le chéile faoi cé chomh héifeachtach is atá ár bhfeachtais promóisin nó oibríochtaí eile. Cuireann na teicneolaíochtaí seo ar chumas sholáthraithe na hanailísíochta a gcuacha féin nó aitheantóirí eile a shocrú nó a léamh ar do ghléas, ar féidir leo iad a úsáid chun faisnéis a bhailiú faoi do ghníomhaíochtaí ar líne thar raon feidhmchlár, suíomhanna Gréasáin nó táirgí eile. D'ainneoin sin, cuirimid cosc ar na soláthraithe anailísíochta siúd rabhchán Gréasáin a úsáid inár suíomhanna chun eolas a bhailiú nó a fheiceáil a chuireann tú in aithne go díreach (ar nós d'ainm agus seoladh ríomhphoist). Is féidir leat dílostáil de bhailiú nó d'úsáid sonraí ag cuid de na soláthraithe anailísíochta seo trí chuairt a thabhairt ar aon cheann de na suíomhanna seo a leanas:
Coigeartaigh

Teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla
Chomh maith le gnáthchuacha agus gnáthrabhcháin Ghréasáin, is féidir lenár dtáirgí teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla eile a úsáid chun comhaid sonraí a stóráil agus a léamh ar do ríomhaire. Déantar é seo de ghnáth chun do shainroghanna a choimeád nó chun luas agus feidhmíocht a fheabhsú trí chomhaid áirithe a stóráil go logánta. Ach, amhail gnáthchuacha, féadfar na teicneolaíochtaí sin a úsáid chun aitheantóir uathúil a stóráil le haghaidh do ríomhaire, ar féidir iad a úsáid ansin chun iompar a rianú. Áirítear ar na teicneolaíochtaí sin Réada Comhroinnte Logánta (nó "fianáin Flash") agus Stóras Feidhmchláir Silverlight.
Réada Comhroinnte Áitiúla nó "Fianáin flash."
Is féidir le suíomhanna Gréasáin a úsáideann teicneolaíochtaí Adobe Flash Réada Comhroinnte Áitiúla nó "fianáin Flash" a úsáid chun sonraí a stóráil ar do ríomhaire. Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil faoin gcaoi fianáin Flash a bhainistiú nó a bhacadh, gabh chuig an

Stóráil feidhmchlár Silverlight
. Tá sé de chumas ag suíomhanna Gréasáin nó feidhmchláir a úsáideann teicneolaíocht Microsoft Silverlight sonraí a stóráil freisin trí leas a bhaint as Stóráil Feidhmchláir Silverlight. Chun foghlaim conas an stóráil sin a bhainistiú nó a bhacadh, féach rannán

Táirgí arna gcur ar fáil ag d'eagraíocht—fógra d'úsáideoirí deiridh
Má úsáideann tú táirge Microsoft le cuntas atá curtha ar fáil ag eagraíocht lena bhfuil tú cleamhnaithe, cosúil le do chuntas oibre nó scoile, is féidir leis an eagraíocht sin an méid seo a leanas a dhéanamh:
Do tháirge agus cuntas táirge Microsoft a rialú agus a riar, lena n-áirítear socruithe príobháideachais an táirge nó cuntas an táirge a rialú.
Do shonraí a rochtain agus a phróiseáil, lena n-áirítear na sonraí idirghníomhaíochta, sonraí diagnóiseacha, agus inneachar do chuid cumarsáide agus do chomhaid, a bhaineann le do tháirge Microsoft agus le cuntais an táirge.
Mura bhfuil tú in ann do chuntas oibre nó scoile a rochtain (mar shampla, má athraíonn do chúrsaí fostaíochta), seans nach mbeidh rochtain agat ar na táirgí ná an t-inneachar a bhaineann leis na táirgí sin, lena n-áirítear na cinn sin a fuair tú ar do shon féin, má bhain tú leas as do chuntas oibre nó scoile le síniú isteach sna táirgí sin.
Tá a lán táirgí Microsoft atá beartaithe lena n-úsáid ag eagraíochtaí, amhail scoileanna agus gnóthais. Féach ar an rannán
táirgí Fiontraíochta agus forbróra

Má chuireann d'eagraíocht rochtain ar fáil duit ar tháirgí Microsoft, tá an úsáid a bhaineann tú as na táirgí Microsoft sin faoi réir pholasaithe d'eagraíochta, más ann dóibh. Ba chóir duit do cheisteanna maidir le príobháideacht, lena n-áirítear aon iarratais ar do chearta cosanta sonraí a chur i bhfeidhm, a sheoladh chuig riarthóir d'eagraíochta. Nuair a úsáideann tú gnéithe sóisialta i dtáirgí Microsoft, is féidir go bhfeicfidh úsáideoirí eile i do líonra cuid de do ghníomhaíochtaí. Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil faoi na gnéithe sóisialta agus feidhmiúlachtaí eile, féach na doiciméid nó an t-inneachar cabhrach a bhaineann leis an táirge Microsoft. Níl Microsoft freagrach as cleachtais phríobháideachais nó shlándála ár gcustaiméirí, a d'fhéadfadh a bheith difriúil ó na cinn atá leagtha amach sa ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Nuair a úsáideann tú táirge Microsoft a sholáthraíonn do eagraíocht, bíonn próiseáil a dhéanann Microsoft do shonraí pearsanta i ndáil leis an táirge sin faoi rialú ag conradh idir Microsoft agus d'eagraíocht. Próiseálann Microsoft do shonraí pearsanta chun an táirge a sholáthar do d'eagraíocht agus duitse, agus i gcásanna áirithe ar mhaithe le hoibríochtaí ghnó Microsoft maidir leis an táirge a sholáthar mar a thuairiscítear sa rannán

cuntas Microsoft
Le cuntas Microsoft, is féidir leat síniú isteach i dtáirgí Microsoft, agus i seirbhísí de chuid chomhpháirtithe áirithe Microsoft. Cuimsítear le sonraí pearsanta a bhaineann le do chuntas Microsoft faisnéis aitheantais, ainm agus sonraí teagmhála, sonraí íocaíochta, sonraí gléis agus úsáide, do theagmhálaithe, faisnéis faoi do ghníomhaíochtaí, d'ábhair spéise agus do cheanáin. Trí shíniú isteach i do chuntas Microsoft is féidir pearsantú a chumasú, mar aon le heispéiris chomhsheasmhacha sna táirgí agus gléasanna ar fad, ceadaítear duit néalstóras sonraí a úsáid, íocaíochtaí a dhéanamh le hionstraimí íocaíochta atá stóráilte i do chuntas Microsoft, agus cumasaítear gnéithe eile chomh maith.
Tá trí chineál de chuntas Microsoft ann:
Nuair a chruthaíonn tú do chuntas Microsoft féin, atá ceangailte le do sheoladh ríomhphoist pearsanta, tugaimid
cuntas Microsoft pearsanta
air sin.
Nuair a chruthaíonn tú nó d'eagraíocht (amhail fostóir nó scoil) cuntas Microsoft duit atá ceangailte le seoladh ríomhphoist arna sholáthar ag an eagraíocht sin duit, tugaimid
cuntas oibre nó scoile
air sin.
Nuair a chruthaíonn tú nó do sholáthraí seirbhíse (amhail soláthraí seirbhíse cábla nó idirlín) do chuntas Microsoft agus go bhfuil sé ceangailte le do sheoladh ríomhphoist le fearann do sholáthraí seirbhíse, tugaimid
cuntas tríú páirtí
air sin.
Má shíníonn tú isteach i seirbhís arna soláthar ag tríú páirtí le do chuntas Microsoft, déanfaidh tú na sonraí cuntais atá riachtanach don tseirbhís sin a chomhroinnt leis an tríú páirtí sin.
Le cuntas Microsoft, is féidir leat síniú isteach i dtáirgí Microsoft, agus i seirbhísí de chuid chomhpháirtithe áirithe Microsoft. Cuimsítear le sonraí pearsanta a bhaineann le do chuntas Microsoft faisnéis aitheantais, ainm agus sonraí teagmhála, sonraí íocaíochta, sonraí gléis agus úsáide, do theagmhálaithe, faisnéis faoi do ghníomhaíochtaí, d'ábhair spéise agus do cheanáin. Trí shíniú isteach i do chuntas Microsoft is féidir pearsantú a chumasú, mar aon le heispéiris chomhsheasmhacha sna táirgí agus gléasanna ar fad, ceadaítear duit néalstóráil sonraí a úsáid, íocaíochtaí a dhéanamh le hionstraimí íocaíochta atá stóráilte i do chuntas Microsoft, agus cumasaítear gnéithe eile chomh maith. Tá trí chineál de chuntas Microsoft ann:
Nuair a chruthaíonn tú do chuntas Microsoft féin, atá ceangailte le do sheoladh ríomhphoist phearsanta, tugaimid
cuntas Microsoft pearsanta
air sin.
Nuair a chruthaíonn tú nó d'eagraíocht (amhail fostóir nó scoil) cuntas Microsoft duit atá ceangailte le seoladh ríomhphoist arna sholáthar ag an eagraíocht sin duit, tugaimid
cuntas oibre nó scoile
air sin.
Nuair a chruthaíonn tú nó do sholáthraí seirbhíse (amhail soláthraí seirbhíse cábla nó idirlín) do chuntas Microsoft atá ceangailte le do sheoladh ríomhphoist le fearann do sholáthraí seirbhíse, tugaimid
cuntas tríú páirtí
air sin.
Cuntais Microsoft phearsanta
. Braitheann na sonraí a bhaineann le do chuntas Microsoft pearsanta, agus an chaoi ina n-úsáidtear na sonraí sin, ar an mbealach ina n-úsáideann tú an cuntas sin.
Do chuntas Microsoft a chruthú
. Nuair a chruthaíonn tú cuntas Microsoft pearsanta, iarrfar ort sonraí pearsanta áirithe a sholáthar agus sannfar uimhir aitheantais uathúil le do chuntas agus eolas a bhaineann leis a aithint. Cé go gcaithfidh tú fíorainm a sholáthar i gcomhar táirgí áirithe, ar nós nuair atá íocaíocht i gceist, is féidir síniú isteach i dtáirgí Microsoft eile, agus iad a úsáid, gan fíorainm a sholáthar. Is féidir sonraí a chuireann tú ar fáil, ar nós d'ainm taispeána, seoladh ríomhphoist, agus uimhir fóin, a úsáid chun cabhrú le daoine eile tú a aimsiú agus dul i dteagmháil leat ar sheirbhísí Microsoft. Mar shampla, daoine arb eol dóibh d’ainm taispeána, do sheoladh ríomhphoist nó d’uimhir fóin, is féidir leo iad a úsáid chun tú a chuardach ar Skype nó ar Microsoft Teams d’úsáid phearsanta agus cuireadh a sheoladh chugat chun nascadh leo. Tabhair faoi deara, má úsáideann tú seoladh ríomhphoist oibre nó scoile chun cuntas Microsoft pearsanta a chruthú féadfaidh d'fhostóir nó do scoil rochtain a fháil ar do shonraí. I gcásanna áirithe, caithfidh tú an seoladh ríomhphoist a athrú go seoladh ríomhphoist pearsanta i dtreo is go mbeidh tú fós in ann rochtain a fháil ar tháirgí atá dírithe ar thomhaltóirí (amhail líonra Xbox).
Síniú isteach ar chuntas Microsoft
. Nuair a shíníonn tú isteach i do chuntas Microsoft, cruthaímid taifead den síniú isteach, ina bhfuil an dáta agus an t-am, eolas faoin táirge ar shínigh tú isteach ann, d'ainm sínithe isteach, an uimhir uathúil i do chuntas, aitheantóir uathúil do ghléis, do sheoladh IP, agus do chóras oibriúcháin agus leagan do bhrabhsálaí.
Síniú isteach ar tháirgí Microsoft
. Ach síniú isteach i do chuntas is féidir pearsantú a fheabhsú, eispéiris gan uaim agus comhsheasmhacha a sholáthar trasna táirgí agus gléasanna, do shonraí néalstórais a rochtain agus a úsáid, íocaíochtaí a dhéanamh le hionstraimí íocaíochta atá stóráilte i do chuntas Microsoft, agus gnéithe agus socruithe breisithe eile a chumasú. Mar shampla, nuair a shíníonn tú isteach, cuireann Microsoft faisnéis arna sábháil ar do chuntas ar fáil thar tháirgí Microsoft ionas go mbeidh rudaí tábhachtacha ar fáil nuair a bhíonn siad de dhíth ort. Nuair a shíníonn tú isteach i do chuntas, beidh tú sínithe isteach i gcónaí go dtí go síníonn tú amach. Má chuireann tú do chuntas Microsoft le gléas Windows (leagan 8 nó leagan níos déanaí), déanfaidh Windows tú a shíniú isteach go huathoibríoch sna táirgí ar an ngléas sin a úsáideann cuntas Microsoft nuair a théann tú chuig na táirgí sin ar an ngléas. Tar éis duit síniú isteach, taispeánfaidh táirgí áirithe d'ainm nó d'ainm úsáideora agus do ghrianghraf próifíle (má tá ceann curtha agat le do phróifíl) mar chuid den úsáid a bhaineann tú as táirgí Microsoft, lena n-áirítear i do chumarsáidí, idirbhearta sóisialta, agus poist phoiblí.

Síniú isteach ar tháirgí tríú páirtí
. Má shíníonn tú isteach i dtáirge tríú páirtí le do chuntas Microsoft, déanfar do shonraí a chomhroinnt leis an tríú páirtí sin de réir pholasaí príobháideachais an tríú páirtí. Gheobhaidh an tríú páirtí sin an uimhir leagain a sannadh do do chuntas freisin (sanntar uimhir nua leagain gach uair a athraíonn tú do shonraí sínithe isteach), chomh maith le faisnéis faoi cibé an ndearnadh do chuntas a dhíghníomhachtú nó nach ndearnadh. Má dhéanann tú do chuid sonraí próifíle a chomhroinnt, féadfaidh an tríú páirtí d'ainm nó d'ainm úsáideora agus do ghrianghraf próifíle (má tá ceann curtha le do phróifíl agat) a léiriú agus tú sínithe isteach sa táirge tríú páirtí. Má roghnaíonn tú íocaíochtaí a dhéanamh le ceannaithe tríú páirtí trí do chuntas Microsoft, cuirfidh Microsoft faisnéis atá stóráilte i do chuntas Microsoft ar aghaidh chuig an tríú páirtí nó chuig a dhíoltóirí (m.sh. próiseálaithe íocaíochta) de réir mar is gá chun d'íocaíocht a phróiseáil agus d'ordú a chomhlíonadh (amhail ainm, uimhir cárta creidmheasa, seoltaí billeála agus poist, agus faisnéis ábhartha teagmhála). Is féidir leis an tríú páirtí na sonraí a fhaigheann sé nuair a shíníonn tú isteach nó nuair a cheannaíonn tú rud éigin a úsáid nó a chomhroinnt de réir a chleachtais agus a pholasaithe féin.
Ba chóir duit an ráiteas príobháideachais do gach táirge a síníonn tú isteach air agus gach ceannaí a gceannaíonn tú uaidh a léamh go cúramach le fáil amach conas a úsáidfidh sé na sonraí a bhailíonn sé.
Cuntais oibre nó scoile
. De ghnáth, bíonn na sonraí a bhaineann le cuntas oibre nó scoile, agus an bealach ina n-úsáidfear iad, cosúil leis an gcaoi a ndéantar sonraí a bhaineann le cuntas Microsoft pearsanta a bhailiú agus a úsáid.
Má úsáideann d'fhostóir nó do scoil Microsoft Entra ID chun an cuntas a chuireann sé ar fáil duit a bhainistiú, féadfaidh tú do chuntas oibre nó scoile a úsáid chun síniú isteach i dtáirgí Microsoft, amhail Microsoft 365 agus Office 365, agus i dtáirgí tríú páirtí arna gcur ar fáil duit ag d'eagraíocht. Má iarrann d'eagraíocht é, beidh ort uimhir gutháin nó seoladh ríomhphoist eile a sholáthar ar son fíorú slándála breise. Agus, má cheadaíonn d'eagraíocht duit, féadfaidh tú úsáid a bhaint as do chuntas oibre nó scoile le síniú isteach i dtáirgí Microsoft nó i dtáirgí tríú páirtí a fhaigheann tú duit féin.
Má shíníonn tú isteach i dtáirgí Microsoft le cuntas oibre nó scoile, tabhair an méid a leanas faoi deara:
Is féidir le húinéir an fhearainn a bhaineann le do sheoladh ríomhphoist do chuntas a rialú agus a bhainistiú, agus do shonraí a rochtain agus a phróiseáil, lena n-áirítear a bhfuil i do mhíreanna cumarsáide agus i do chomhaid, lena n-áirítear sonraí arna stóráil i dtáirgí a sholáthraíonn d'eagraíocht duit agus i dtáirgí a fhaigheann tú féin.
Tá an úsáid a bhaineann tú as na táirgí faoi réir bheartais d'eagraíochta, más ann dóibh. Ba chóir duit machnamh a dhéanamh ar pholasaithe d'eagraíochta agus ar cibé an bhfuil tú sásta a chur ar chumas d'eagraíochta do chuid sonraí a rochtain sula mbaineann tú úsáid as do chuntas oibre nó scoile le síniú isteach i dtáirgí a fhaigheann tú duit féin.
Mura bhfuil tú in ann do chuntas oibre nó scoile a rochtain (mar shampla, má athraíonn do chúrsaí fostaíochta), seans nach mbeidh rochtain agat ar na táirgí ná an t-inneachar a bhaineann leis na táirgí sin a fuair tú ar do shon féin, má bhain tú leas as do chuntas oibre nó scoile le síniú isteach sna táirgí sin.
Níl Microsoft freagrach as cleachtais phríobháideachais ná slándála d'eagraíochta, a d'fhéadfadh a bheith difriúil ó chleachtais Microsoft.
Má tá d'eagraíocht ag bainistiú na húsáide a bhaineann tú as táirgí Microsoft, iarrtar ort do cheisteanna maidir le príobháideacht, lena n-áirítear aon iarratais ar do chearta cosanta sonraí a chur i bhfeidhm, a sheoladh chuig do riarthóir féin. Féach an rannán

Céard is Xbox ann?
Is é Xbox an roinn cluichíochta agus siamsaíochta de Microsoft. Óstálann Xbox líonra ar líne ina bhfuil bogearraí agus eispéiris ar líne a ghabhann trasna iliomad ardáin. Ligeann an líonra seo don leanbh atá agat cluichí a aimsiú agus a imirt, amharc ar inneachar agus ceangal le cairde ar Xbox agus ar líonraí cluichíochta agus sóisialta eile.
Nuair a shíníonn siad isteach in Xbox, in aipeanna, cluichí nó ar chonsól Xbox, tógaimid aitheantóir uathúil dá ngléas. Nuair a bhíonn a gconsól Xbox ceangailte leis an Idirlíon, mar shampla, agus nuair a shíníonn siad isteach ar a gconsól, aithnímid an consól agus an leagan de chóras oibriúcháin an chonsóil atá in úsáid acu.
Tá eispéiris nua á gcur ar fáil i gcónaí ag Xbox i bhfeidhmchláir chliaint atá ceangailte le agus arna dtacú ag seirbhísí, amhail líonra Xbox agus an chluichíocht néil. Nuair a bhíonn tú sínithe isteach in eispéireas Xbox, bailímid sonraí riachtanacha chun cabhrú le hiontaofacht na n-eispéireas seo a choimeád iontaofa, chun dáta, slán agus ag feidhmiú mar a bheifí ag súil leis.
Sonraí a bhailímid nuair a chruthaíonn tú próifíl Xbox
. Éilítear ortsa mar thuismitheoir nó mar chaomhnóir toiliú le bailiú sonraí pearsanta ó leanbh faoi bhun 13 bliana d'aois nó mar a shonraítear a mhalairt le do dhlínse. Le cead uait, is féidir próifíl Xbox a bheith ag do leanbh agus an líonra Xbox ar líne a úsáid. Le linn chruthú phróifíl Xbox an linbh, síneoidh tú isteach le do chuntas Microsoft féin chun a fhíorú gur eagraí fásta thú i do ghrúpa teaghlaigh Microsoft. Bailímid seoladh ríomhphoist malartach nó uimhir fóin chun slándáil cuntais a threisiú. Má theastaíonn cabhair ó do leanbh chun rochtain a fháil ar a gcuntas, beidh siad in ann ceann de na malartaigh seo a úsáid chun a bhailíochtú gur leo an cuntas Microsoft.
Bailímid faisnéis theoranta faoi pháistí, lena n-áirítear ainm, dáta breithe, seoladh ríomhphoist, agus réigiún. Nuair a chláraíonn tú do leanbh le haghaidh próifíl Xbox, faigheann siad gamertag (leasainm poiblí) agus aitheantóir uathúil. Nuair a chruthaíonn tú próifíl Xbox do pháiste, toilíonn tú le Microsoft faisnéis a bhailiú, a úsáid agus a chomhroinnt bunaithe ar a socruithe príobháideachais agus cumarsáide ar líonra ar líne Xbox. Réamhshocraítear socruithe príobháideachais agus cumarsáide do pháiste do na socruithe is sriantaí.
Sonraí a bhailímid
. Bailímid faisnéis faoin úsáid a bhaineann do leanbh as seirbhísí Xbox, cluichí, feidhmchláir agus consóil lena n-áirítear:
Nuair a shíníonn siad isteach ar Xbox agus amach as, na cluichí a imríonn siad agus na feidhmchláir a úsáideann siad, dul chun cinn a gcluiche, d’éachtaí agus staidreamh faoina gcluichí, na rudaí a cheannaíonn siad agus an t-inneachar a fhaigheann siad.
Na cluichí a imríonn siad agus na feidhmchláir a úsáideann siad, dul chun cinn a gcluiche, gaisce, am imirt in aghaidh an chluiche, agus staitisticí imirt eile.
Sonraí feidhmíochta faoi chonsóil Xbox, Xbox Game Pass agus feidhmchláir eile Xbox, líonra Xbox, gléasanna nasctha, agus faoi nasc líonra, lena n-áirítear earráidí bogearraí nó crua-earraí.
An t-inneachar arna chur leis, arna uaslódáil nó arna chomhroinnt acu trí líonra Xbox, lena n-áirítear téacs, pictiúir agus an físeán a dhéantar a ghabháil i gcluichí agus i bhfeidhmchláir.
Gníomhaíocht shóisialta, lena n-áirítear sonraí comhrá agus idirghníomhaíochtaí le cluichirí eile, agus na naisc (cairde a chuirtear leis agus daoine a leanann iad) a dhéanann siad ar líonra Xbox.
Má úsáideann do leanbh consól nó feidhmchlár Xbox ar ghléas eile ar féidir leis líonra Xbox a rochtain, agus má chuimsíonn an gléas sin gléas stórála (tiomántán crua nó aonad cuimhne), stórálfar sonraí úsáide ar an ngléas stórála lena seoladh chuig Microsoft an chéad uair eile a shíníonn siad isteach ar Xbox, fiú má bhíonn siad ag imirt as líne.
Sonraí diagnóiseacha Xbox
. Má bhíonn consól Xbox in úsáid ag do leanbh, seolfaidh an consól na sonraí riachtanacha chuig Microsoft. Is iad na sonraí riachtanacha an t-íosmhéid sonraí is gá chun Xbox a choinneáil sábhailte, slán, chun dáta agus ag feidhmiú mar a bheifí ag súil leis.
Gabhálacha cluiche
. Is féidir le haon imreoir a bhfuil páirt á ghlacadh aige i seisiún cluiche ilimreoirí físeán a thaifeadadh (gearrthóga cluiche) agus gabhálacha scáileáin a dhéanamh den amharc cluiche atá aige. Is féidir carachtar cluiche agus leasainm cluichire do linbh a ghabháil i ngearrthóga cluiche agus gabhálacha scáileáin na n-imreoirí eile le linn an tseisiúin sin. Má ghabhann imreoir gearrthóga cluiche agus gabhálacha scáileáin ar ríomhaire, d'fhéadfadh na gearrthóga cluiche a eascraíonn as sin comhrá fuaime a ghabháil freisin má cheadaíonn socruithe príobháideachta agus cumarsáide do linbh ar líonra ar líne Xbox é.
Fotheidealú
. I gcomhrá fíor-ama (“cóisir”) Xbox, is féidir le himreoirí gné gutha go téacs a ghníomhachtú, a cheadaíonn dóibh amharc ar an gcomhrá sin mar théacs. Má ghníomhachtaíonn imreoir an ghné seo, úsáideann Microsoft na sonraí téacs a eascraíonn as sin chun fotheidealú comhrá a sholáthar do na himreoirí a dteastaíonn sé uathu. D´fhéadfadh na sonraí seo a úsáid freisin chun timpeallacht shábháilte cluichíochta a sholáthar agus chun na
Caighdeáin Phoiblí Xbox
a chur i bhfeidhm.
Úsáid sonraí
. Baineann Microsoft úsáid as na sonraí a bhailímid chun feabhas a chur ar tháirgí agus ar eispéiris cluichíocht— ionas go bhfeabhsaíonn sé agus go bhfuil sé níos sábháilte agus níos spraoi le himeacht ama. Chomh maith leis sin, cuireann na sonraí a bhailímid ar ár gcumas eispéiris phearsantaithe shaincheaptha a sholáthar don leanbh ata agat. Cuimsíonn sé sin iad a nascadh le cluichí, ábhar, seirbhísí, agus moltaí.
Sonraí Xbox ar féidir le daoine eile amharc orthu
. Nuair a bhíonn líonra Xbox á úsáid ag do leanbh, tá a láithreacht ar líne (ar féidir a shocrú chun "as líne de réir cuma" nó "bactha"), leasainm cluichire, staitisticí faoi imirt cluichí, agus éachtaí le feiceáil ag imreoirí eile ar an líonra. Ag brath ar an gcaoi a socraíonn tú socruithe sábháilteachta Xbox do linbh, d'fhéadfaidís faisnéis a roinnt agus iad ag imirt nó ag déanamh cumarsáide le daoine eile ar líonra Xbox.
Sábháilteacht
. D'fhonn cabhrú le timpeallacht shábháilte cluichíocht a dhéanamh den líonra Xbox agus Caighdeáin an Phobail do Xbox a fhorfheidhmiú, féadfaimid guth, téacs, íomhánna, físeáin agus inneachar sa chluiche a bhailiú agus a athbhreithniú (ar nós gearrthóga cluiche a uaslódálann do leanbh, comhráite atá acu agus rudaí post i gcluichí agus cluichí).
Frithchalaois agus cosc caimiléireachta
. Tá sé tábhachtach dúinn timpeallacht chothrom imeartha a sholáthar. Coisctear calaois, haiceáil, goid cuntas agus aon ghníomhaíocht neamhúdaraithe nó chalaoiseach eile nuair a úsáideann do leanbh cluiche Xbox ar líne nó aon fheidhmchlár nasctha leis an líonra ar a c(h)onsól Xbox, ríomhaire nó gléas móibíleach. D'fhonn calaois agus caimiléireacht a bhrath agus a chosc, féadfaimid úsáid a bhaint as uirlisí frith-aicearra agus cosc caimiléireachta, feidhmchláir agus teicneolaíochtaí eile. Féadfaidh teicneolaíochtaí den cineál sin sínithe digiteacha a chruthú (ar a dtugtar “hais”) ag baint úsáide as faisnéis áirithe a bhailítear óna gconsól Xbox, ríomhaire nó gléas móibíleach agus conas a úsáideann siad an gléas sin. D’fhéadfadh faisnéis faoin mbrabhsálaí, gléas, gníomhaíochtaí, aitheantóirí cluiche agus córais oibriúcháin a bheith san áireamh anseo.
Sonraí Xbox a chomhroinntear le foilsitheoirí cluiche agus feidhmchláir
. Nuair a úsáideann do leanbh cluiche ar líne Xbox nó feidhmchlár atá ceangailte leis an líonra ar a gconsól Xbox, ríomhaire nó gléas móibíleach, bíonn rochtain ag foilsitheoir an chluiche nó an fheidhmchláir sin ar shonraí faoin úsáid a bhaineann siad as chun cabhrú leis an bhfoilsitheoir a tháirge a sholáthar chun tacú leis agus a fheabhsú. D’fhéadfadh an méid seo a leanas a bheith san áireamh sna sonraí seo: aitheantóir úsáideora do linbh Xbox leasainm cluichire do linbh, faisnéis theoranta cuntais amhail tír agus raon aoise, sonraí faoi chumarsáid do linbh i gcluichí, gníomhaíocht fhorfheidhmithe Xbox, seisiúin imeartha (mar shampla, rudaí a rinneadh sa chluiche, na cineálacha feithiclí a úsáideadh sa chluiche), láithreacht do linbh ar líonra Xbox, an méid ama a chaitheann siad ag imirt an chluiche nó an fheidhmchláir, rangaithe, staidreamh, próifílí cluichirí, abhatáranna nó pictiúir de chluichirí, liostaí cairde, fothaí gníomhaíochta na gclubanna oifigiúla ina bhfuil siad páirteach, ballraíocht i gclubanna oifigiúla, agus aon inneachar eile a chruthaíonn nó a chuireann siad isteach sa chluiche nó san fheidhmchláir.
Bíonn a gcaidreamh uathúil neamhspleách féin le húsáideoirí ag foilsitheoirí agus forbróirí tríú páirtí na gcluichí agus na bhfeidhmchlár, agus déanann siad sonraí pearsanta a bhailiú agus a úsáid i gcomhréir lena bpolasaithe príobháideachais ar leith. Ba chóir duit athbhreithniú cúramach a dhéanamh ar a bpolasaithe chun an dóigh a n-úsáideann siad sonraí do linbh a fháil amach. Mar shampla, d’fhéadfadh foilsitheoirí a roghnú sonraí cluiche a nochtadh nó a thaispeáint (amhail ar chláir ceann riain) trína seirbhísí féin. D’fhéadfadh nasc lena bpolasaithe a bheith le fáil ar na leathanaigh mionsonraí cluiche nó feidhmchláir inár siopaí.

. Tá teaglaim ceamara, micreafóin agus braiteora infridheirg sa bhraiteoir Kinect, agus d’fhéadfaí leis guth agus gluaiseachtaí a chumasú chun an imirt a rialú. Mar shampla:
Más mian leat, is féidir an ceamara a úsáid chun síniú isteach sa Líonra Xbox go huathoibríoch le haithint aghaidhe. Fanann na sonraí ar an gconsól, ní chomhroinntear iad le duine ar bith, agus is féidir iad a scriosadh am ar bith.
Le haghaidh cluichíochta, mapálfaidh Kinect an fad idir ailt corp do linbh chun duine cipíneach díot a chruthú chun cluichíocht a chumasú.
Cumasaíonn micreafóin Kinect comhrá gutha idir imreoirí le linn cluichíochta. Cumasaíonn an micreafóin fosta orduithe gutha chun consól, cluiche, nó feidhmchláir a rialú, nó chun téarmaí cuardaigh a iontráil.
Is féidir braiteoir Kinect a úsáid, leis, le haghaidh cumarsáid fuaime agus físeáin trí sheirbhísí ar nós Skype.

An áit a stórálaimid agus a bpróiseálaimid sonraí pearsanta
Féadfar sonraí pearsanta a bhailíonn Microsoft a stóráil agus a phróiseáil i do réigiún, sna Stáit Aontaithe nó in aon tír eile ina bhfuil áiseanna oibre ag Microsoft nó ag cleamhnaithe, fochuideachtaí, nó soláthraithe seirbhíse. Coimeádann Microsoft mór-ionaid sonraí sna tíortha seo a leanas: an Astráil, an Ostair, an Bhrasaíl, Ceanada, an Fhionlainn, an Fhrainc, an Ghearmáin, Hong Cong, an India, Éire, an tSeapáin, an Chóiré, Lucsamburg, an Mhalaeisia, an Ísiltír, Singeapór, an Afraic Theas, an Ríocht Aontaithe agus Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá. Go tipiciúíl, bíonn an príomhshuíomh stórála suite i réigiún an chustaiméara nó sna Stáit Aontaithe, agus is minic a bhíonn cúltaca aige chuig ionad sonraí i réigiún eile. Roghnaítear an suíomh/na suíomhanna stórais chun oibriú go héifeachtach, chun feidhmiúlacht a fheabhsú, agus chun iomarcaíochtaí a chruthú d'fhonn sonraí a chosaint i gcás éaradh seirbhíse nó fadhb eile. Déanaimid bearta chun na sonraí a bhailímid faoin ráiteas príobháideachais seo a phróiseáil de réir forálacha an ráitis seo agus riachtanais an dlí is infheidhme.
Aistrímid sonraí pearsanta ón Limistéar Eorpach Eacnamaíoch, ón Ríocht Aontaithe agus ón Eilvéis chuig tíortha eile, cuid acu nár chinn an Coimisiún Eorpach go bhfuil leibhéal leordhóthanach cosanta sonraí acu go fóill. Mar shampla, d'fhéadfadh nach féidir na cearta céanna a chinntiú lena ndlíthe, nó b'fhéidir nach bhfuil údarás maoirseachta príobháideachta ann a bheidh in ann plé le do chuid gearán. Nuair a dhéanaimid aistrithe den sórt sin, úsáidimid meicníochtaí dlí éagsúla, lena n-áirítear conarthaí mar na clásail chonarthacha chaighdeánacha a d’fhoilsigh an Coimisiún Eorpach faoi Chinneadh and Choimisiúin 2021/914, chun a chinntiú go dtaistealaíonn do chearta agus cosaintí le do chuid sonraí.

Sonraí pearsanta a choinneáil
Coinníonn Microsoft sonraí pearsanta cibé fad is gá chun na táirgí a sholáthar agus na hidirbhearta a d'iarr tú a chomhlíonadh, nó le haghaidh cuspóirí dlisteanacha eile ar nós cloí leis na dualgais dlí atá orainn, díospóidí a réiteach agus ár gcomhaontuithe a fhorghníomhú. De bhrí nach ionann na riachtanais sin i gcás cineálacha difriúla sonraí, chomhthéacs ár n-idirghníomhaíochtaí leat nó an úsáid a bhaineann tú as táirgí, is féidir tréimhsí coinneála iarbhír a bheith an-difriúil ó chéile.
Áirítear ar na critéir eile a úsáidtear chun tréimhsí coinneála a chinneadh:
An ndéanann custaiméirí na sonraí a sholáthar, a chruthú nó a chothabháil leis an ionchas go gcoinneoimid iad go dtí go mbainfidh siad go dearfach iad?
I measc na samplaí tá doiciméad a stórálann tú in OneDrive, nó teachtaireacht ríomhphoist a choinníonn tú i do bhosca isteach Outlook.com. I gcásanna mar sin, déanfaimid iarracht na sonraí a choinneáil go dtí go scriosann tú iad go gníomhach, amhail ríomhphost a aistriú ó do bhosca isteach Outlook.com go dtí fillteán na Míreanna Scriosta, agus ansin an fillteán sin a fholmhú (nuair a fholmhaítear d'fhillteán Míreanna Scriosta, fanann na míreanna folmhaithe sin inár gcóras suas le 30 lá sula scriostar den uair dheiridh iad). (Tabhair faoi deara go bhféadfaí na sonraí a scriosadh níos luaithe ar chúis éigin eile, mar shampla má sháraíonn tú na teorainneacha i leith líon na sonraí ar féidir a stóráil i do chuntas.)
An bhfuil rialú uathoibrithe ann, mar shampla i bpainéal príobháideachas Microsoft, a chuireann ar chumas an chustaiméara na sonraí pearsanta a rochtain agus a scriosadh ag am ar bith?
Mura bhfuil, is iondúil go nglacfar le ham coinneála sonraí giorraithe.
An bhfuil sonraí pearsanta de chineál íogair?
Más ea, is iondúil go nglacfaí le ham coinneála giorraithe.
Ar ghlac Microsoft agus ar fhógair sé tréimhse choinneála shonrach do chineál áirithe sonraí?
Mar shampla, i gcás fiosruithe cuardaigh Bing, déanaimid ceisteanna stóráilte a dhí-aithint tríd an seoladh IP iomlán a bhaint tar éis 6 mhí, agus IDanna fianán agus aitheantóirí tras-seisiúin eile a úsáidtear chun cuntas nó gléas ar leith a aithint a bhaint tar éis 18 mí.
Ar thug an t-úsáideoir toiliú ar feadh tréimhse choinneála níos faide?
Má thug, coinneoimid sonraí de réir do thoilithe.
An bhfuil Microsoft faoi réir oibleagáid dhlíthiúil, chonarthach nó chomhchosúil na sonraí a choinneáil nó a scriosadh?
I measc na samplaí tá dlíthe éigeantacha coinneála sonraí sa dlínse is infheidhme, orduithe rialtais chun sonraí a bhaineann le himscrúdú a chaomhnú, nó sonraí a choimeádtar chun críocha dlíthíochta. Go contrártha, má tá orainn, de réir an dlí, ábhar neamhdhlíthiúil a bhaint, déanfaimid amhlaidh.

Fógraíocht
Cuireann fógraíocht ar ár gcumas cuid dár dtáirgí a sholáthar, tacaíocht a chur ar fáil ina leith agus feabhas a chur orthu. Ní úsáideann Microsoft an méid a deir tú i ríomhphoist, comhráite duine le duine, glaonna físeáin ná glórphost ná do dhoiciméid, grianghraif ná comhaid phearsanta eile chun fógraíocht a dhíriú ort. Bainimid leas as sonraí eile, a bhfuil cur síos orthu thíos, le haghaidh fógraíochta inár airíonna Microsoft agus ar airíonna tríú páirtí. Mar shampla:
D'fhéadfadh Microsoft na sonraí a bhailímid a úsáid chun cuid de na fógraí a fheiceann tú ar airíonna gréasáin Microsoft, amhail
Microsoft.com
, Microsoft Start agus Bing, a roghnú agus a sholáthar. Féadfaimid sonraí den sórt sin a úsáid freisin chun fógraí a roghnú agus a sheachadadh ar airíonna digiteacha tríú páirtí.
Nuair a dhéantar ID fógraíochta a chumasú in Windows 10 mar chuid de do shocruithe príobháideachta, is féidir le tríú páirtithe an ID fógraíochta a rochtain agus a úsáid (ar an gcaoi chéanna is a dhéanann suíomhanna Gréasáin aitheantóir uathúil a stóráiltear i gcuach a rochtain agus a úsáid) chun fógraí a roghnú agus a chur ar fáil ina leithéid d'fheidhmchláir.
B´fhéidir go roinnfimid sonraí a bhailíomar lenár gcomhpháirtithe inmheánach agus seachtrach, ar nós Xandr, Yahoo, nó Facebook (féach thíos), ionas go mbeidh na fógraí a fheiceann tú inár dtáirgí agus ina dtáirgí siúd níos ábhartha agus luachmhar duit.
Féadfaidh fógróirí rogha a dhéanamh ár rabhcháin Ghréasáin a chur ar a suíomhanna, nó leas a bhaint as teicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla, lena chur ar chumas Microsoft faisnéis a bhailiú ar a suíomhanna, amhail gníomhaíochtaí, ceannacháin, agus cuairteanna; úsáidimid na sonraí sin ar son ár gcustaiméirí fógraíochta chun fógraí a sholáthar.
D'fhéadfadh na fógraí a fheiceann tú a bheith roghnaithe bunaithe ar na sonraí a phróiseálaimid fút, cosúil le d'ábhair spéise agus ceanáin, do shuíomh, d'idirbhearta, conas a úsáideann tú ár dtáirgí, d'iarratais chuardaigh, nó an t-inneachar a fhéachann tú air. Mar shampla, má fhéachann tú ar inneachar faoi ghluaisteáin ar Microsoft Start, féadfaimid fógraí faoi ghluaisteáin a thaispeáint duit; má cuardaíonn tú "áiteanna píotsa i Seattle" i Bing, féadfar fógraí a thaispeáint sna torthaí cuardaigh do bhialanna i Seattle.
D'fhéadfadh na fógraí a fheiceann tú a bheith bunaithe freisin ar fhaisnéis eile atá foghlamtha againn fút le himeacht ama ó shonraí déimeagrafacha, sonraí suímh, iarratais chuardaigh, ábhair spéise agus ceanáin, sonraí úsáide ónár dtáirgí agus suíomhanna féin, agus an t-eolas a bhailímid fút ó shuíomhanna agus ó fheidhmchláir ár bhfógróirí agus ár gcomhpháirtithe. Déanaimid tagairt do na fógraí sin mar"fhógraíocht phearsantaithe" sa ráiteas seo. Mar shampla, má fhéachann tú ar inneachar cluichíochta ar
xbox.com
, seans go bhfeicfidh tú fógraí do chluichí ar Microsoft Start. Chun fógraíocht phearsantaithe a sholáthar, comhcheanglaímid fianáin atá curtha ar do ghléas le faisnéis a bhailímid (seoladh IP, mar shampla) nuair a idirghníomhaíonn do bhrabhsálaí lenár suíomhanna Gréasáin. Má dhiúltaíonn tú d'fhógraíocht phearsantaithe a fháil, ní úsáidfear sonraí a ghabhann leis na fianáin sin.
Is féidir linn faisnéis fút a úsáid chun fógraíocht phearsantaithe a sholáthar duit nuair a úsáideann tú seirbhísí Microsoft. Má tá tú logáilte isteach le do chuntas Microsoft agus má thoiligh tú cead a thabhairt do Microsoft Edge do ghníomhaíocht ar líne a úsáid le haghaidh fógraíochta phearsantaithe, feicfidh tú fógraí le haghaidh táirgí agus seirbhísí bunaithe ar do ghníomhaíocht ar líne agus Microsoft Edge á úsáid agat. Chun do shocruithe príobháideachais le haghaidh Edge a chumrú, gabh chuig Microsoft Edge > Socruithe > Príobháideachas agus Seirbhísí. Chun do shocruithe príobháideachais agus fógraí a chumrú le haghaidh do chuntas Microsoft i ndáil le do ghníomhaíocht ar líne ar fud brabhsálaithe, Microsoft Edge san áireamh, nó nuair a osclaíonn tú suíomhanna gréasáin nó feidhmchláir tríú páirtí, gabh chuig do Phainéal ag

Xandr
, comhlacht Microsoft, agus comhlachtaí fógraíochta tríú páirtí chun cabhrú le cuid dár seirbhísí fógraíochta a sholáthar, agus tugaimid cead do chomhlachtaí fógraíochta tríú páirtí eile fógraí a thaispeáint ar ár suíomhanna chomh maith. D´fhéadfadh na comhlachtaí tríú páirtí seo fianáin a chur ar do ríomhaire agus sonraí a bhailiú faoi do ghníomhaíochtaí ar líne thar suíomhanna idirlíne nó seirbhísí ar líne.

Cumais Microsoft Copilot.
Is é
Microsoft Copilot
an Compánach IS Microsoft a chuidíonn leat níos mó a bhaint amach trí eispéireas amháin a ritheann thar na gléasanna ar fad le tuiscint ar comhthéacs ábhartha ar an gréasán, ar do ríomhaire pearsanta agus ar fheidhmchláir leis na scileanna cuí a thabhairt duit ag an am ceart. Le cabhair ó Copilot, is féidir le húsáideoirí dréacht nua doiciméid Word a thosú, nó láithreoireacht PowerPoint a ghiniúint agus rochtain á déanamh acu ar Copilot i bhfeidhmchláir M365, freagraí ar chuardaigh casta ar líne a aimsiú go gasta, doiciméid ábhartha nó inneachar pearsanta eile a aimsiú, nó spreagadh a fháil chun amhráin nua, scéalta nó inneachar eile a chumadh, chomh maith le tascanna eile. Is é atá in Copilot ná teaghlach seirbhísí, agus is féidir le le bailiúchán Microsoft a bheith difriúil ag bráth ar an seirbhís nó feidhmiúlacht atá beartaithe in aon chás ar leith.
Is é
suíomh gréasáin
agus feidhmchlár Copilot (atá ar fáil ar iOS agus Android) ann ná croílár eispéireas an tomhaltóra Copilot. Istigh san eispéireas seo, is féidir le úsáideoirí cuardach a dhéanamh ar líne, téacs, íomhánna, amhráin nó aschur eile a chruthú nó bheith páirteach in gnéithe eile, mar atá breiseáin. Go chuig an suíomh agus insan aip, cuireann úsáideoirí “leideanna” isteach a thugann treoir do Copilot (m.s., “Tabhair dom moltaí le haghaidh bialann atá oiriúnach do níos mó na 10 duine in aice liom”). le freagra ábhartha a thabhairt, bainfidh Copilot úsáid as an leid seo, chomh maith le suíomh an úsáideoir, teanga, agus socruithe eile le freagra úsáideach a chumadh. I roinnt margaidh, is féidir le úsáideoirí fíordheimhnithe cead a thabhairt ar Copilot rochtain a bheith aige ar stair na leideanna leis an tairge a phearsantú níos fearr. Úsáideann an tairge Copilot seo sonraí a bhailítear leis na seirbhísí Copilot a fheabhsú, fograíocht ábhartha san áireamh. Is féidir le úsáideoirí atá sínithe isteach a stair leideanna a bhainistiú ar an Painéal Príobháideachta Microsoft agus a suíomh, teanga agus socruithe eile a athrú.
Tá Copilot le feiceáil mar cúntóir le tairgí Microsoft eile mar atá Bing agus Microsoft Edge. sna casanna sin, is ionann próiseáil sonraí agus bun- úsáidí na táirgí sin. Tá úsáid agus bailiú sonraí pearsanta Copilot in Bing i gcomhréir le chéile le príomh-thairiscint chuardaigh gréasáin Bing mar a thuairiscítear sa chuid seo. Tá tuilleadh eolais maidir le Copilot in Bing ar fáil ag
Copilot in Bing: Ár gcur chuige maidir le AI Freagrach
. In Microsoft Edge, bíonn Copilot le feiceáil san eispéireas taobh-barra agus is féidir leis cabhrú tascanna bainte leis na suíomhanna greasáin a chur i gcrích (m.s. “achoimrigh an leathanach seo”). Úsáidtear na sonraí seo i dtaca leis an rannán Microsoft Edge don ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Is tairiscint tomhaltóra eile é
Copilot Pro
agus tairgeann sé rochtain tosaíochta do shíntiúsóirí ar na múnlaí is déanaí, cumais cruthú íomhá feabhsaithe, agus rochtain ar Copilot in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, Excel agus Outlook. Tá tiomsú sonraí atá ag an príomhleathanach Copilot Pro cosúil leis an tiomsú sonraí atá ag Copilot tomhaltóra, mar a chuirtear síos ar thuas. Tá feidhmiúlacht Copilot chosúil san áireamh leis i síntiúis Microsoft 365 Family agus Microsoft 365 Personal. Nuair atá Copilot comhtháite le táirgí Microsoft 365, tá tiomsú sonraí Copilot i gcomhréir le chéile leis an dóigh a chuirtear síos ar tiomsú sonraí agus úsáid insan rannán Táirgiúlacht agus cumarsáid den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Tá tairiscintí Copilot déanta fá choinne úsáideoirí enterprise. Nuair a chuirtear ar a chumas ag enterprise incháilithe, tá Copilot le Cosaint ar shonraí tráchtála ar fáil do úsáideoirí atá logáilte isteach le aitheantas Entra s’acu rud a dhéanann tiomsú sonraí a íoslaghdú i dtaca le ionchais úsáideoirí enterprise. Tá tuilleadh eolais ar Copilot le Cosaint ar shonraí tráchtála ar fáil

DPA Táirgí agus Seirbhísí
. Ina theannta sin, mar a dhéantar foráil dó sa
DPA Táirgí agus Seirbhísí
caighdeánach, ghlac Microsoft le freagrachtaí breise rialaitheora sonraí faoi GDPR nuair a bhíonn sonraí pearsanta á bpróiseáil aige i ndáil lena chuid oibríochtaí gnó dlisteanacha teagmhasach do soláthar a sheirbhísí do custaiméirí tráchtála Microsoft, amhail billeáil agus bainistíocht cuntais; cúiteamh; tuairisciú inmheánach múnlú gnó; agus tuairisciú airgeadais. Bainimid úsáid as Sonraí Pearsanta san fhoirm is lú so-aitheanta a thacóidh le próiseáil atá riachtanach le haghaidh na h-oibríochtaí dleathacha gnó seo. Braithimid ar shonraí staitistiúla agus ar shonraí pearsanta comhiomlána pearsantaithe sula n-úsáidtear iad le haghaidh ár n-oibríochtaí dleathacha gnó, ag fáil réidh leis an gcumas daoine aonair ar leith a shainaithint.
Sonraí Riarthóra
. Is Sonraí Riarthóra iad an fhaisnéis a thugtar do Microsoft agus tú ag clárú, ag ceannach nó ag riar Seirbhísí Fiontair ar Líne. Bainimid úsáid as Sonraí Riarthóra chun Seirbhísí Ar Líne Fiontraíochta a chur ar fáil, idirbhearta a chur i gcrích, an cuntas a riar, calaois a bhrath agus a chosc, agus ár n-oibleagáidí dlí a chomhlíonadh. Áirítear le sonraí riarthóra an t-ainm, an seoladh, an uimhir fóin agus an seoladh ríomhphoist a thugann tú, chomh maith le sonraí úsáide comhthiomsaithe a bhaineann le do chuntas, amhail na rialuithe a roghnaíonn tú. D'fhéadfadh faisnéis teagmhála do chomhghleacaithe agus do chairde a bheith san áireamh sna Sonraí Riarthóra, má aontaíonn tú í a sholáthar do Microsoft ar mhaithe le cuireadh a sheoladh chucu chun leas a bhaint as na Seirbhísí Fiontair ar Líne, agus chuige sin amháin; is féidir go ndéanfaimis teagmháil leis na daoine aonair sin le cumarsáidí lena n-áirítear faisnéis fút, amhail d'ainm agus do phictiúr próifíle.
De réir mar is gá, bainimid úsáid as Sonraí Riarthóra chun teagmháil a dhéanamh leat faoi do chuntas, síntiúis, billeáil, agus nuashonruithe ar Sheirbhísí Ar Líne Fiontraíochta, lena n-áirítear faisnéis faoi ghnéithe nua, slándáil, nó fadhbanna eile teicniúla.

Eispéiris Nasctha
. Cuireann Microsoft 365 tuilleadh eispéireas ar fáil i gcónaí i bhfeidhmchláir cliant atá ceangailte le seirbhísí néalbhunaithe agus a fhaigheann tacú uathu. Ina theannta sin, tá fo-thacar de na heispéiris bhainteacha seo ar fáil in Oifig. Má roghnaíonn tú eispéiris nasctha a úsáid, baileofar sonraí seirbhíse riachtanacha chun a chinntiú go mbeidh na heispéiris nasctha sin iontaofa, cothrom le dáta agus slán i gcónaí agus go bhfeidhmeoidh siad mar a bheadh súil leis. Féach an fhaisnéis bhreise thíos faoi shonraí seirbhíse riachtanacha.
Samplaí d'eispéiris nasctha is ea dul i mbun oibre le daoine eile ar dhoiciméad atá stóráilte ar OneDrive nó ábhar doiciméad Word a aistriú go teanga eile. Dhá chineál eispéireas nasctha atá ann.
Eispéiris a dhéanann anailís ar d'inneachar
. Eispéiris a úsáideann inneachar do chomhaid chun moltaí dearaidh, moltaí eagarthóireachta, léargas sonraí agus gnéithe eile den sórt seo a sholáthar duit. Mar shampla, Dearthóir PowerPoint nó Editor in Word.
Eispéiris a íoslódálann inneachar ar líne
. Eispéiris a cheadaíonn duit inneachar ar líne a chuardach agus a íoslódáil, lena n-áirítear teimpléid, íomhánna, samhlacha 3T, físeáin agus ábhair thagartha chun do dhoiciméid a bhreisiú. Mar shampla, teimpléid nó QuickStarter PowerPoint.
Is féidir leat rochtain a fháil ar na rialuithe príobháideachais laistigh do fheidhmchláir cliant Microsoft 365 agus Office. Cuireann na socruithe príobháideachta seo ar do chumas d'eispéiris nasctha a chumrú. Mar shampla, féadfaidh tú rogha a dhéanamh eispéiris nasctha a chumasú, trína n-íoslódáiltear inneachar ar líne, ach gan eispéiris nasctha a dhéanann anailís ar inneachar a chumasú. Má chasann tú eispéiris nasctha as, casfaidh tú eispéiris bhreise as chomh maith, ar nós comh-údar ar dhoiciméad agus stóráil comhaid ar líne. Ach fiú amháin má úsáideann tú an socrú príobháideachta chun eispéiris nasctha a chasadh as, beidh feidhmiúlacht áirithe ar fáil i gcónaí, cuir i gcás do bhosca poist a shioncronú in Outlook, chomh maith le seirbhísí riachtanacha a thuairiscítear thíos. Níl na rialuithe seo ar fáil agus Microsoft 365 á n-úsáid ar an nGréasán, toisc go mbeidh tú nasctha le néal cheana féin. Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil maidir le rochtain a fháil ar na rialuithe seo, féach
Socruithe Príobháideachais Cuntais.
Má roghnaíonn tú cineálacha áirithe eispéireas nasctha a dhíchumasú, déanfar an t-ordú ribín nó roghchláir do na heispéiris nasctha sin a liathú, nó gheobhaidh tú teachtaireacht earráide nuair a dhéanann tú iarracht na heispéiris nasctha sin a úsáid.
Seirbhísí riachtanacha
. Tá sraith seirbhísí ann atá riachtanach d'fheidhmeanna Microsoft 365 agus Office agus nach féidir iad a dhíchumasú. Mar shampla, seirbhís riachtanach is ea an tseirbhís ceadúnaithe a dheimhníonn go bhfuil tú ceadúnaithe mar is cóir chun Microsoft 365 a úsáid. Déantar sonraí riachtanacha seirbhíse mar gheall ar na seirbhísí seo a bhailiú agus a sheoladh chuig Microsoft, is cuma cad iad na socruithe eile atá cumraithe agat. Féach

D’fhéadfaí go n-áireofaí i sonraí seirbhíse riachtanach faisnéis a bhaineann le hoibriú an eispéiris nasctha a theastaíonn chun an tseirbhís bhunúsach a choinneáil slán, cothrom le dáta, agus ag feidhmiú mar a bheifí ag súil leis. Má roghnaíonn tú eispéireas nasctha a úsáid a dhéanann anailís ar d’inneachar, Translate in Word mar shampla, seoltar an téacs a chlóscríobh tú agus a roghnaigh tú a aistriú agus déantar é a phróiseáil chun eispéireas nasctha a chur ar fáil duit. Ní dhéantar an téacs ná an t-aistriúchán a stóráil inár seirbhís. D’fhéadfaí go n-áireofaí i sonraí seirbhíse riachtanach freisin faisnéis a theastaíonn ó eispéireas nasctha chun a thasc a chur i gcrích, cosúil le faisnéis chumraíochta faoi fheidhmchlár Microsoft 365 nó Office.

Teagmhálaithe Teams
. Le do chead, sioncronóidh Teams do ghléas, Outlook agus teagmhálaithe Skype go tréimhsiúil agus déanfar seic le haghaidh úsáideoirí Teams eile a mheaitseálann teagmhálaithe ar leabhair seoltaí de chuid do ghléis, Outlook, nó Skype. Tusa atá i gceannas i gcónaí ar do theagmhálaithe agus is féidir leat stop a chur leis an sioncronú uair ar bith. Má roghnaíonn tú sioncronú na dteagmhálaithe atá ar do ghléas, Outlook, nó Skype a stopadh, nó má tá tú neamhghníomhach ar do ghléas, scriosfar aon teagmhálaí nach raibh meaitseáilte i rith phróiseas an tsioncronaithe ó Teams. Más mian leat cuireadh a thabhairt d’aon teagmhálaí atá ar do ghléas, Outlook, nó Skype chun dul isteach i gcomhrá, is féidir leat cuireadh a thabhairt d’úsáideoirí chuig 1:1 go díreach, nó is féidir le Microsoft cuireadh a thabhairt ar do shon trí SMS nó tríd an ríomhphost le haghaidh cuirí chuig comhráite grúpa. Is féidir leat bac a chur ar úsáideoirí mura bhfuil tú ag iarraidh cumarsáid a fháil uathu; anuas air sin, is féidir leat ábhar imní a thuairisciú chuig Microsoft.
Fógra do theamghálaithe nach úsáideoirí iad.
Má thaispeántar d’fhaisnéis i leabhair seoltaí an ghléis, Outlook, nó Skype de chuid úsáideoir Teams a roghnaíonn na teagmhálaithe atá acu ar an ngléas, Outlook, nó Skype a shioncronú lena dteagmhálaithe Teams, d’fhéadfadh Microsoft d’fhaisnéis a phróiseáil lena sheiceáil más úsáideoir Teams reatha thú agus chun ligean d’úsáideoirí Teams cuireadh a thabhairt duit chuig an tseirbhís, lena n-áirítear trí SMS agus ar ríomhphost. Fad is atá an t-úsáideoir Teams gníomhach ar Teams ar an ngléas agus fad is atá sioncrónú teagmhálaithe leis an ngléas nó seirbhís infheidhme cumasaithe ag an úsáideoir, stórálfar do chuid faisnéise ar ár bhfreastalaithe agus próiseálfaimid do chuid faisnéise go tréimhsiúil mar chuid d’eispéireas sioncrónaithe úsáideoirí Teams chun seiceáil an bhfuil tú tar éis clárú le Teams idir an dá linn.
Faigh tuilleadh faisnéise maidir le conas a phróiseálaimid d’fhaisnéis i ndáil leis an ngné shioncronú teagmhálaithe a thairgtear d’úsáideoirí Teams

Má roghnaíonn tú clárú le Teams, taispeánfar thú mar theagmhálaí Teams molta nua d’aon úsáideoir de chuid Teams nó Skype a bhfuil d’fhaisnéis stóráilte ina leabhar seoltaí ar ghléas, Outlook nó Skype. Mar úsáideoir Teams, beidh tú in ann bac a chur ar úsáideoirí Teams eile mura bhfuil fonn ort cumarsáid a fháil uathu. Lena chois sin, is féidir leat ábhar imní a thuairisciú chuig Microsoft.
Teagmhálaithe tríú páirtí.
Is féidir rogha a dhéanamh chun teagmhálaithe ó sholáthraithe tríú páirtí a shioncronú freisin. Má roghnaíonn tú do theagmhálaithe tríú páirtí ar Teams a dhíshioncronú, scriosfar teagmhálaithe tríú páirtí go léir ó Teams. Má thug tú cead duit úsáid a bhaint as na teagmhálaithe tríú páirtí sin i bhfeidhmchláir agus seirbhísí eile de chuid Microsoft, beidh na teagmhálaithe sin fós ar fáil do na feidhmchláir agus seirbhísí Microsoft sin.
Is féidir teagmhálaithe tríú páirtí a bhaint ó gach feidhmchlár agus seirbhís De chuid Microsoft trí chuntais tríú páirtí a bhaint de Teams. Tabhair faoi deara go mb'fhéidir go mbeidh tionchar ag baint cuntais tríú páirtí ó Teams ar d'eispéiris ar fheidhmchláir agus seirbhísí de chuid Microsoft a úsáideann an cuntas tríú páirtí sin freisin.
Féilire Teams.
Is féidir rogha a dhéanamh freisin d'fhéilire Teams a shioncronú le féilirí ó sholáthraithe tríú páirtí. Is féidir leat stopadh de do fhéilire Teams a shioncronú am ar bith ach cuntas tríú páirtí a bhaint ó Teams. Má thoiligh tú sonraí tríú páirtí a úsáid ar fheidhmchláir agus seirbhísí eile Microsoft, tabhair faoi deara go mb'fhéidir go mbeidh tionchar ag baint sonraí cuntais tríú páirtí i Teams ar d'eispéiris ar fheidhmchláir agus ar sheirbhísí eile Microsoft.
Comhroinnt suímh
. Is féidir leat do shuíomh statach nó do shuíomh beo a chomhroinnt le daoine aonair nó le grúpaí i Teams. Tusa atá i gceannas agus is féidir leat stad den chomhroinnt uair ar bith. Is féidir suíomh páistí a chomhroinnt le toiliú tuismitheoireachta nó i ngrúpaí ina bhfuil duine fásta ón ngrúpa teaghlaigh Microsoft.
Brúfhógraí
. Chun glaonna, comhráite agus teachtaireachtaí eile isteach a chur in iúl duit, úsáideann Teams an tseirbhís fógraí ar do ghléas. I gcás mórchuid gléasanna, is cuideachta eile a sholáthraíonn na seirbhísí sin. Chun an té atá ag glaoch ort a chur in iúl duit, mar shampla, nó na chéad chúpla focal de chomhrá nua a thabhairt duit, ní mór do Teams é a insint don tseirbhís fógraí ionas gur féidir an fógra a sholáthar duit. Úsáidfidh an chuideachta a sholáthraíonn an tseirbhís fógraí ar do ghléas an fhaisnéis seo i gcomhréir lena téarmaí agus lena polasaí príobháideachais féin. Níl Microsoft freagrach as na sonraí a bhailíonn an chuideachta a sholáthraíonn an tseirbhís fógraí.
Mura dteastaíonn uait leas a bhaint as na seirbhísí fógra i gcás glaonna agus teachtaireachtaí isteach Teams, cas as é sna socruithe a gheofar ar do ghléas.
Comhráite agus cruinnithe le húsáideoirí deiridh custaiméirí Enterprise

OneDrive
Ceadaíonn OneDrive duit do chomhaid a stóráil agus a fheiceáil ar gach gléas, nach mór. Is féidir comhaid a chomhroinnt agus comhoibriú a dhéanamh orthu in éineacht le daoine eile. I leaganacha áirithe de OneDrive is féidir leat rochtain a fháil ar do OneDrive pearsanta trí shíniú isteach le do chuntas Microsoft pearsanta agus ar do OneDrive for Business trí shíniú isteach le do chuntas Microsoft oibre nó scoile mar chuid den úsáid a bhaineann d'eagraíocht as Microsoft 365 nó Office 365.
Nuair a bhaineann tú úsáid as OneDrive, bailímid sonraí faoin úsáid a bhaineann tú as an tseirbhís, chomh maith leis an inneachar a stórálann tú, ionas gur féidir linn na seirbhísí a sholáthar, a fheabhsú, agus a chosaint. I measc na samplaí tá innéacs a dhéanamh d'inneachar do dhoiciméid OneDrive ionas gur féidir leat cuardach dóibh níos déanaí, agus úsáid a bhaint as faisnéis suímh le go mbeifeá ábalta cuardach a dhéanamh do ghrianghraif bunaithe ar an áit a glacadh an grianghraf. Bailímid eolas gléis chomh maith ionas gur féidir linn eispéiris phearsantaithe a sholáthar, ar nós cead a thabhairt duit inneachar a shioncronú trasna gléasanna agus na socruithe saincheaptha a thaiscéaladh.
Nuair a stórálann tú inneachar in OneDrive, gheobhaidh an t-inneachar sin na ceadúnais chomhroinnte atá ag an bhfillteán ina stórálann tú é. Mar shampla, má chuireann tú inneachar i bhfillteán poiblí, beidh an t-inneachar ar fáil go poiblí agus do dhuine ar bith ar an idirlíon ar féidir leo an fillteán sin a aimsiú. Má chuireann tú inneachar i bhfillteán príobháideach, beidh an t-inneachar príobháideach.
Nuair a chomhroinneann tú inneachar ar líonra sóisialta amhail Facebook nó ó ghléas atá sioncronaithe agat le do chuntas OneDrive, déanfar d'inneachar a uaslódáil chuig an líonra sóisialta sin nó déanfar nasc chuig an inneachar sin a phostáil ar an líonra sóisialta sin. Má dhéantar amhlaidh, beidh gach duine ar an líonra sóisialta sin in ann an t-inneachar a rochtain. Chun an t-inneachar a scriosadh, caithfidh tú é a scriosadh ón líonra sóisialta (má rinneadh é a uaslódáil chuige, seachas nasc) agus ó OneDrive.
Nuair atá inneachar ar OneDrive á chomhroinnt agat le cairde trí nasc, seoltar ríomhphost leis an nasc chuig na cairde sin. Bíonn sa nasc cód ceadúnúcháin a thugann cead do dhuine ar bith a bhfuil an nasc sin acu dul chuig d'inneachar. Má sheolann cara leat an nasc chuig daoine eile, beidh siad ábalta, leis, dul chuig d'inneachar, fiú mura mian leat é a chomhroinnt leo. Chun ceadanna rochtana a chúlghairm maidir le hinneachar atá agat ar OneDrive, sínigh isteach i do chuntas agus ansin roghnaigh an t-inneachar ar leith chun na leibhéil ceadanna rochtana a bhainistiú. Déantar nasc a dhíghníomhachtú nuair a aisghairtear an cead lena aghaidh. Ní bheidh duine ar bith in ann an nasc a úsáid chun rochtain a fháil ar an inneachar mura gcomhroinneann tú an nasc an athuair.
Ní stóráiltear comhaid atá faoin bhainistiú OneDrive for Business san áit chéanna le comhaid do OneDrive pearsanta. Bailíonn OneDrive for Business sonraí pearsanta agus comhroinneann sé iad ar mhaithe le fíordheimhniú, sonraí ar nós seoladh agus pasfhocal ríomhphoist, agus seoltar iad chuig Microsoft agus/nó chuig soláthraí do sheirbhís Microsoft 365 nó Office 365.

Outlook
Tá táirgí Outlook deartha chun do tháirgiúlacht a fheabhsú trí chumarsáid níos fearr, agus áirítear iontu Outlook.com, feidhmchláir Outlook agus seirbhísí gaolmhara.
Outlook.com
. Is é Outlook.com an phríomhsheirbhís ríomhphoist ó Microsoft le haghaidh tomhaltóirí, agus áirítear air cuntais ríomhphoist le seoltaí a chríochnaíonn ar outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com agus msn.com. Cuireann Outlook.com gnéithe ar fáil lena féidir leat nascadh le do chairde ar líonraí sóisialta. Ní mór duit cuntas Microsoft a chruthú chun Outlook.com a úsáid.
Nuair a scriosann tú ríomhphost nó mír eile ón mbosca ríomhphoist in Outlook.com, téann sé go hiondúil chuig d'fhillteán na míreanna scriosta, agus fanann sé ansin ar feadh 7 lá mura gcuireann tú ar ais é sa bhosca isteach, mura bhfolmhaíonn tú an fillteán, nó mura bhfolmhaíonn an tseirbhís an fillteán go huathoibríoch, in ord ar bith. Nuair a fholmhaíonn tú fillteán na Míreanna Scriosta, fanann na míreanna folmhaithe sin inár gcóras ar feadh suas le 30 lá sula scriostar iad go deo, ach amháin sa chás go bhfuil orainn na sonraí a choinneáil níos faide de réir an dlí.
Feidhmchláir Outlook
. Is bogearraí iad feidhmchláir chliaint Outlook a shuiteálann tú ar do ghléas agus a chuireann ar do chumas ríomhphoist, míreanna féilire, comhaid, teagmhálaithe agus sonraí eile a bhainistiú ó ríomhphost, stóras comhaid agus seirbhísí eile, ar nós Exchange Online nó Outlook.com nó freastalaithe ar nós Microsoft Exchange. Is féidir leat úsáid a bhaint as cuntais iomadúla ó sholáthraithe éagsúla, lena n-áirítear sholáthraithe tríú páirtí, le feidhmchláir Outlook,
lena n-áirítear an feidhmchlár Outlook for Windows nua
.
Chun cuntas a chur leis, ní mór duit cead a thabhairt d'Outlook sonraí a rochtain ó na seirbhísí stórais ríomhphoist nó comhad.
Nuair a chuireann tú cuntas le Outlook, sioncronófar do ríomhphost, míreanna féilire, comhaid, teagmhálaithe, socruithe agus sonraí eile ón gcuntas sin chuig do ghléas. Má tá an feidhmchlár móibíleach Outlook in úsáid agat, sioncronófar na sonraí chuig freastalaithe Microsoft chun gnéithe breise a chumasú, amhail cuardach níos tapúla, scagadh pearsantaithe ríomhphoist níos lú tábhachta, agus an cumas chun ceangaltáin ríomhphoist a chur leis ó sholáthraithe comhaid nasctha gan an feidhmchlár Outlook a fhágáil. Má tá tú ag úsáid feidhmchlár deisce Outlook, féadfaidh tú rogha a dhéanamh cibé acu an dtabharfaidh tú cead maidir le sioncronú na sonraí lenár bhfreastalaithe. Aon uair is mian leat, is féidir leat cuntas a bhaint nó athruithe a dhéanamh ar na sonraí atá sioncronaithe ó do chuntas.
Má chuireann tú cuntas leis ó eagraíocht (ar nós d'fhostóir nó scoil), féadfaidh úinéir fearann na heagraíochta polasaithe agus rialuithe a chur i bhfeidhm (mar shampla, fíordheimhniú ilfhachtóra a éileamh nó an cumas chun sonraí a ghlanadh ón ngléas go cianda) a chuireann isteach ar an úsáid a bhaineann tú as Outlook.
Cumais ghléis a úsáid
. Is féidir leis an úsáideoir ábhar ríomhphoist a dheachtaigh agus é a sheoladh trí úsáid a bhaint as an ngné Dictate, i dtaca le cliaint Outlook a dtacaíonn leis. D’fhéadfaí an ghné Dictate a chumraigh chun úsáid a bhaint as micreafón an ghléis nó aon mhicreafón eile ar féidir le húsáideoir é a nascadh lena ghléas, cosúil le péire cluaisíní micreafón-cumasaithe. D’fhéadfadh freisin go mbainfeadh Outlook úsáid as d’eolas shuíomh gléis chun faisnéis aimsire a thabhairt duit i dtaca le do shuíomh reatha chomh maith leis an gcumas a thabhairt duit suímh in aice láimhe a chuardach.

Beidh úsáideoirí Teams in ann teagmháil a dhéanamh leat ar Skype agus do stádas láithreachta ar Skype a fheiceáil. Gheobhaidh tú tuilleadh faisnéise faoi Teams sa
rannán Microsoft Teams
den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Ag aimsiú teagmhálaithe Teams agus Skype.
Áirítear i do phróifíl Skype faisnéis a chuir tú ar fáil agus tú ag cumrú cuntas Microsoft nó Skype. Chun cur ar chumas daoine eile tú a aimsiú ar Skype (nó ar tháirgí a bhíonn ag idirghníomhú le Skype, ar nós Skype for Business nó Microsoft Teams), tá do phróifíl Skype san áireamh in eolairí cuardaigh poiblí Skype agus Teams agus d'fhéadfadh sé a bheith le feiceáil ar Skype agus Teams araon. Ag brath ar do chuid socruithe próifíle, is féidir le húsáideoirí Skype agus Teams thú a aimsiú le d'ainm, seoladh ríomhphoist agus / nó uimhir theileafóin. Áirítear i do phróifíl d’ainm úsáideora, abhatár, agus aon sonraí eile is mian leat a chur le do phróifíl nó a thaispeáint do dhaoine eile.
Glaoch éigeandála sna Stáit Aontaithe.
Má chumasaíonn tú comhroinnt suímh le haghaidh glaonna éigeandála, baileofar do shuíomh go tréimhsiúil chun Microsoft a chumasú do shuíomh a chomhroinnt le soláthraí seirbhíse do ghlaonna éigeandála má dhiailíonn tú 911. Ní chomhroinntear d’fhaisnéis suímh ach amháin má chumasaíonn tú comhroinnt suímh le haghaidh glaonna éigeandála, agus cuireann tú glao 911.
Teagmhálaithe Skype.
Má úsáideann Outlook.com chun teagmhálaithe a bhainistiú, cuirfidh Skype na daoine ar a bhfuil aithne agat le do liosta teagmhálaithe Skype go huathoibríoch go dtí go n-iarrfaidh tú ar an bhfeidhmchlár stopadh. Le do chead, sioncronóidh Skype na teagmhálaithe atá ar do ghléas go tréimhsiúil agus déanfar seic le haghaidh úsáideoirí Skype eile a mheaitseálann teagmhálaithe ar leabhair seoltaí de chuid do ghléis nó Outlook. Tusa atá i gceannas i gcónaí ar do theagmhálaithe agus is féidir leat stop a chur leis an sioncronú uair ar bith. Is féidir leat bac a chur ar úsáideoirí mura bhfuil tú ag iarraidh cumarsáid a fháil uathu. Má roghnaíonn tú sioncronú na dteagmhálaithe atá ar do ghléas a stopadh, nó má tá tú neamhghníomhach ar do ghléas, scriosfar aon teagmhálaí nach raibh meaitseáilte i rith phróiseas an tsioncronaithe ó Skype. Más mian leat cuireadh a thabhairt d’aon teagmhálaí atá ar do ghléas nó Outlook chun dul isteach i gcomhrá, is féidir leat cuireadh a thabhairt d’úsáideoirí chuig 1:1 go díreach, nó is féidir le Microsoft cuireadh a thabhairt ar do shon trí SMS nó tríd an ríomhphost le haghaidh cuirí chuig comhráite grúpa. Is féidir leat bac a chur ar úsáideoirí mura bhfuil tú ag iarraidh cumarsáid a fháil uathu; anuas air sin, is féidir leat ábhar imní a thuairisciú chuig Microsoft.
Fógra do theagmhálaithe nach úsáideoirí iad.
Má thaispeántar d’fhaisnéis i leabhar seoltaí atá ar ghléas nó Outlook de chuid úsáideoir Skype a roghnaíonn a dteagmhálaithe atá ar an ngléas nó Outlook a shioncronú lena dteagmhálaithe Skype, d’fhéadfadh Microsoft d’fhaisnéis a phróiseáil chun seiceáil más úsáideoir Skype thú agus chun ligean d’úsáideoirí Skype cuireadh a thabhairt duit chuig an seirbhís, lena n-áirítear trí SMS agus tríd an ríomhphost. Fad is a leanann an t-úsáideoir Skype ar aghaidh a bheith gníomhach ar Skype ar a ghléas nó ar a gléas agus fad is a leanann an t-úsáideoir ar aghaidh ag cumasú sioncronú teagmhálaithe, stórálfar d’fhaisnéis ar ár bhfreastalaithe agus próiseálfaimid d’fhaisnéis go tréimhsiúil mar chuid d’eispéireas sioncronaithe an úsáideoir Skype chun seiceáil má tá tú tar éis clárú le Skype idir an dá linn.
Faigh tuilleadh faisnéise maidir le conas a phróiseálaimid d’fhaisnéis i ndáil leis an ngné shioncronú teagmhálaithe a thairgtear d’úsáideoirí Skype
.
Má roghnaíonn tú clárú le Skype, taispeánfar thú mar theagmhálaí Skype molta nua d’aon úsáideoir de chuid Teams agus Skype a bhfuil d’fhaisnéis stóráilte ina leabhar seoltaí ar ghléas nó Outlook. Mar úsáideoir Skype, beidh tú in ann bac a chur ar úsáideoirí eile de chuid Skype agus Teams mura bhfuil fonn ort cumarsáid a fháil uathu. Lena chois sin, is féidir leat ábhar imní a thuairisciú chuig Microsoft.
Cuideachtaí comhpháirtíochta
. Chun Skype a chur ar fáil do níos mó daoine, téimid i gcomhpháirtíocht le cuideachtaí eile chun gur féidir Skype a thairiscint trí sheirbhísí na gcuideachtaí sin. Má úsáideann tú Skype trí chuideachta nach Microsoft í, rialaíonn beartas príobháideachta na cuideachta sin an tslí a láimhseáiltear na sonraí. Chun an dlí is infheidhme a chomhlíonadh nó freagairt do phróiseas bailí dlí, nó chun cabhrú lenár gcuideachta comhpháirtíochta nó oibreoir áitiúil an dlí a chomhlíonadh nó freagairt a thabhairt, is féidir go ndéanfaimid do shonraí a rochtain, a aistriú a nochtadh, nó a chaomhnú. D'fhéadfadh d'inneachar príobháideach, mar shampla, ar nós a bhfuil i do theachtaireachtaí meandracha, teachtaireachtaí físeáin stóráilte, glórphost, nó aistrithe comhad a bheith san áireamh ansin.
Bainisteoir Skype
. Le Skype Manager is féidir leat úsáid Skype grúpa (úsáid do theaghlaigh, mar shampla) a bhainistiú ó áit lárnach amháin. Nuair a chumraíonn tú grúpa, tusa a bheidh mar Riarthóir Bainisteoir Skype agus feicfidh tú pátrúin úsáide, lena n-áirítear faisnéis mhionsonraithe, cosúil le sonraí tráchta agus sonraí ceannachán, maidir le baill eile den ghrúpa a bhfuil an rochtain sin ceadaithe acu. Má chuireann tú faisnéis leis, amhail d'ainm, beidh daoine eile sa ghrúpa in ann é a fheiceáil. Is féidir le baill den ghrúpa toiliú a aistarraingt ó Bhainisteoir Skype ach cuairt a thabhairt ar a
leathanach cuntais Skype
.
Brúfhógraí
. Chun glaonna, comhráite, agus teachtaireachtaí eile isteach a chur in iúl duit, úsáideann feidhmchláir Skype an tseirbhís fógra ar do ghléas. I gcás mórchuid gléasanna, is cuideachta eile a sholáthraíonn na seirbhísí seo. Chun an té atá ag glaoch ort a chur in iúl duit, mar shampla, nó na chéad chúpla focal de chomhrá nua a thabhairt duit, ní mór do Skype é a insint don tseirbhís fógra ionas gur féidir leo an fógra a sholáthar duit. Úsáidfidh an chuideachta a sholáthraíonn an tseirbhís fógra ar do ghléas an fhaisnéis seo de réir a dtéarmaí agus a bpolasaí príobháideachais féin. Níl Microsoft freagrach as na sonraí a bhailíonn an chuideachta a sholáthraíonn an tseirbhís fógraí. Mura dteastaíonn uait leas a bhaint as na seirbhísí fógra i gcás glaonna agus teachtaireachtaí isteach Skype, cas as é sna socruithe a gheofar i bhfeidhmchlár Skype ar do ghléas.
Gnéithe aistriúcháin
. Nuair a úsáideann tú gnéithe aistriúcháin Skype, bailíonn agus úsáideann Skype do chomhrá chun an tseirbhís aistriúcháin a chur ar fáil. Le cead uait, d’fhéadfadh go n-úsáidfí do shonraí chun cabhrú le táirgí agus le seirbhísí Microsoft a fheabhsú. Chun cabhrú leis an teicneolaíocht aitheanta cainte foghlaim agus feabhsú, déantar anailís ar abairtí agus ar thras-scríbhinní uathoibríocha agus cuirtear na ceartúcháin, más ann dóibh, isteach inár gcóras. Cuireann sé sin le feidhmíocht seirbhísí níos fearr. D’fhéadfadh trascríobh láimhe de do ghearrthóga gutha a bheith san áireamh sna sonraí seo. Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil faoin gcaoi a ndéanann Microsoft bainistíocht ar do shonraí gutha, féach
teicneolaíochtaí Aithint cainte
.
Gnéithe taifeadta
. Tá gné thaifeadta i leaganacha áirithe de Skype trínar féidir leat cuid de do ghlao fuaime / físe, nó é go léir, a chomhroinnt. Déanfar an taifeadadh a stóráil agus a chomhroinnt mar chuid de stair do chomhráite leis an duine nó grúpa a bhí ar an nglao leat.
Ba chóir duit do fhreagrachtaí dlíthiúla a thuiscint sula ndéanann tú aon chumarsáid a thaifeadadh. D’fhéadfadh go n-áireofaí air seo toiliú roimh ré a fháil ó gach duine a ghlacann páirt sa chomhrá nó aon údaruithe eile de réir mar is gá.
Níl Microsoft freagrach as an úsáid a bhaineann tú as do thaifeadtaí nó gnéithe an taifeadta.
Róbait Skype
. Is ríomhchláir iad róbait a thairgeann Microsoft nó tríú páirtithe lenar féidir a lán nithe úsáideacha a dhéanamh, amhail cuardach do nuacht, cluichí a imirt, agus mórán eile. Ag brath ar a gcumais, féadfaidh rochtain a bheith ag róbait ar d'ainm taispeána, do ID Skype, do thír, do réigiún, do theanga, agus aon teachtaireachtaí, fuaime nó físe, nó aon inneachar a chomhroinneann tú leis an róbat. Déan athbhreithniú ar phróifíl an róbait agus ar a ráiteas príobháideachais sula dtosaíonn tú comhrá aon le haon nó comhrá grúpa le róbat. Féadfaidh tú róbat a scriosadh mura dteastaíonn uait teagmháil a dhéanamh leis a thuilleadh. Sula gcuireann tú róbat le grúpa, deimhnigh go bhfuil rannpháirtithe an ghrúpa toilteanach a gcuid sonraí a chomhroinnt leis an róbat.
Fotheidealú
. Áirítear i ngnéithe áirithe Skype feidhmiúlacht inrochtaineachta cosúil le fotheidealú. I rith ghlaonna Skype, féadfaidh rannpháirtí glao gné gutha go téacs a ghníomhachtú, a cheadaíonn don úsáideoir amharc ar an gcomhrá fuaime mar théacs. Má ghníomhachtaíonn úsáideoir an ghné seo, ní bhfaighidh rannpháirtithe eile glao fógra. Úsáideann Microsoft na sonraí seo gutha agus téacs chun fotheidealú fuaime a sholáthar d'úsáideoirí.
Gnéithe an Cheamara
. Nuair a úsáideann tú an ghné ceamara i SwiftKey, is féidir leat rogha a dhéanamh d’fhíseáin agus d’íomhánna a fheabhsú le seirbhísí lionsaí tríú páirtí. Is gné é Lionsa a úsáideann Réaltacht Mhéadaithe (RA) chun do fhéiníní a athrú ar bhealach spraíúil, mar shampla cuma a chur ort mar an t-ainmhí is fearr leat. Ag baint úsáide as an gceamara i Skype, is féidir leat an ghné lionsa atá corpraithe sa Skype a roghnú chun d'aghaidh agus do lámha a athrú. Ag brath ar an lionsa a roghnaíonn tú, is féidir d'fhíseáin agus d'íomhánna a phróiseáil chun faisnéis a bhaint amach faoi shuíomh áiteanna éagsúla ar d'aghaidh agus ar do lámha. Úsáidtear na sonraí asbhainte chun éifeachtaí RA a chur i bhfeidhm ar d’aghaidh agus ar do lámha amháin. Ní úsáidtear aon cheann de na sonraí seo chun tú a aithint go pearsanta. Déantar na sonraí seo a phróiseáil ar feadh an tseisiúin ar do ghléas amháin, agus ansin scriostar láithreach iad. Ní sheoltar na sonraí seo chuig Skype nó chuig aon tríú páirtí.

Bing
Áirítear le seirbhísí Bing seirbhísí cuardaigh agus mapála, chomh maith le feidhmchláir agus cláir eile a gcuirtear síos orthu sa chuid seo. Déantar sonraí a bhailiú agus a phróiseáil i mórán foirmeacha le seirbhísí Bing, lena n-áirítear téacs dúchaithe nó clóscríofa, sonraí urlabhra, agus íomhánna. Áirítear seirbhísí Bing ar sheirbhísí eile de chuid Microsoft chomh maith, amhail feidhmchláir Microsoft 365, Cortana, agus gnéithe áirithe in Windows (a dtagraímid dóibh mar eispéiris arna gcumhachtú ag Bing).
Nuair a dhéanann tú cuardach, nó nuair a úsáideann tú eispéireas arna chumhachtú ag Bing ina gcaithfear cuardach a dhéanamh nó ordú a iontráil ar do shon, baileoidh Microsoft na téarmaí cuardaigh nó na horduithe a sholáthraíonn tú, (ar féidir leo a bheith i bhfoirm téacs, sonraí gutha, nó íomhá), mar aon le do sheoladh IP, do shuíomh, na haitheantóirí uathúla a gheofar inár gcuacha agus i dteicneolaíochtaí comhchosúla, am agus dáta do chuardaigh agus cumraíocht do bhrabhsálaí. Mar shampla, má úsáideann tú seirbhísí guth-chumasaithe Bing, seolfar d'ionchur gutha agus do shonraí feidhmíochta a ghabhann leis an bhfeidhmiúlacht ghutha chuig Microsoft. Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil faoin gcaoi a ndéanann Microsoft bainistíocht ar do shonraí gutha, féach
teicneolaíochtaí aithint cainte
. Agus, má úsáideann tú seirbhísí íomhá-chumasaithe Bing, seolfar an íomhá a sholáthraíonn tú chuig Microsoft. Nuair a úsáideann tú eispéireas arna chumhachtú ag Bing, amhail Bing Lookup, chun focal nó abairt ar leith a chuardach laistigh de leathanach Gréasáin nó doiciméad, seoltar an focal nó an abairt sin chuig Bing mar aon le roinnt inneachair mórthimpeall air/uirthi ionas gur féidir torthaí cuardaigh atá ábhartha maidir le comhthéacs a chur ar fáil.
Cuardach Bing feabhsaithe ag AI
. Cuimsíonn cuardach Bing feidhmiúlacht cuardaigh gréasáin feabhsaithe IS, ag úsáid Microsoft Copilot, a thacaíonn le húsáideoirí trí thorthaí cuardaigh ábhartha a sholáthar, athbhreithniú agus achoimre a dhéanamh ar fud an ghréasáin, ceisteanna taighde a scagadh tríd an taithí comhrá agus cruthaitheacht a spreagadh trí chuidiú le húsáideoirí inneachar a chruthú.

Má bhíonn Deasc Bing nó Barra Uirlisí Bing á úsáid agat agus má roghnaíonn tú le bheith rannpháirteach sa Chlár um Fheabhsú Eispéireas Bing, bailímid freisin sonraí bhreise faoi conas a úsáideann tú na sainfheidhmchláir Bing seo, ar nós na seoltaí agus suíomhanna atá feicthe agat, chun ábharthacht agus rangú a fheabhsú duit. Le do phriobháideacht a chosaint, ní bhaintear úsáid as na sonraí a bhailítear tríd an Ríomhchlár um Fheabhsú Eispéireas Bing chun tú a shainaithint nó chun teagmháil a dhéanamh leat, nó chun fógraíocht a dhíriú ort. Is féidir leat an Clár um Fheabhsú Eispéireas Bing a dhíchumasú am ar bith i Socruithe Deasc Bing nó Barra Uirlisí Bing. Ar deireadh, scriostar an fhaisnéis a bhailiodh tríd an gClár Fheabhsú Chleachtadh Bing tar éis 18 mí.
Coimeád agus dí-aithint
. Déanfaimid ceisteanna cuardaigh stóráilte a dhí-aithint tríd an seoladh IP ina iomláine a bhaint tar éis 6 mhí, agus aitheantóirí fianáin agus aitheantóirí tras-seisiúin eile, a úsáidtear chun cuntas nó gléas ar leith a aithint, a bhaint tar éis 18 mí.
Pearsantú tríd an gcuntas Microsoft
. Tugann seirbhísí Bing áirithe eispéireas níos fearr duit nuair a shíníonn tú isteach le do chuntas Microsoft pearsanta, mar shampla, do stair chuardaigh a shioncronú idir gléasanna. Is féidir leat na gnéithe pearsantaithe sin a úsáid chun d'ábhair spéise, ceanáin, agus socruithe a shaincheapadh, agus chun do chuntas a cheangal le seirbhísí tríú páirtí. Téigh chuig
Socruithe Bing
chun do shocruithe pearsantaithe a bhainistiú, nó oscail
Painéal Príobháideachta Microsoft
chun do chuid sonraí a bhainistiú.
Stair na gcuardach a bhainistiú
. Agus tú sínithe isteach ar cuntas Microsoft pearsanta, is féidir leat do stair chuardaigh agus comhrá ar an
bpainéal painéal Príobháideachta Microsoft
a scriosadh. Tugann an tseirbhís Stair na gCuardach ó Bing, atá le fáil i Socruithe Bing, bealach eile duit chun amharc arís ar na téarmaí cuardaigh a chuir tú isteach cheana agus ar na torthaí a ndearna tú cliceáil orthu nuair a bhain tú úsáid as cuardach Bing i do bhrabhsálaí. Is féidir leat an stair chuardaigh ar ghléas a ghlanadh tríd an tseirbhís sin. Cuimhnítear freisin ar na comhráite a bhíonn agat le Microsoft Copilot in Bing mar “Gníomhaíocht le déanaí”. Sábháiltear stair gníomhaíochtaí le déanaí, agus ainmneacha na gcomhráite bunaithe de réir réamhshocraithe ar an gcéad cheist den chomhrá. Taispeántar do ghníomhaíocht le déanaí ar thaobh na láimhe deise den fhuinneog comhrá agus tú ag úsáid na seirbhíse. Má dhéantar do stair a ghlanadh, ní féidir an stair sin a thaispeáint i do Stair Chuardaigh nó i do stair chomhrá, ach ní scriostar faisnéis ónár logaí cuardaigh. Coinnítear na logaí sin agus baintear an fhaisnéis phearsanta díobh de réir mar atá sonraithe thuas nó de réir mar a d'ordaigh tú tríd an bpainéal príobháideachta. Má tá tú sínithe isteach i gcuntas oibre nó scoile Microsoft a úsáideann Cuardach Microsoft in Bing, is féidir leat stair do chuardaigh Chuardach Microsoft in Bing a easpórtáil ach ní féidir leat í a scrios. Is féidir le do riarthóir seirbhíse Chuardach Microsoft in Bing stair chomhbhailithe cuardaigh a fheiceáil sna húsáideoirí fiontair uile ach ní bhíonn cuardach aonair a dhéanann úsáideoir le feiceáil.
Seirbhísí tríú páirtí a úsáideann Bing
. Bíonn rochtain agat ar eispéiris arna gcumhachtú ag Bing nuair atá seirbhísí tríú páirtí in úsáid agat, ar nós Yahoo!. Chun na seirbhísí sin a chur ar fáil, faigheann Bing sonraí ó na comhpháirtithe sin agus ó chomhpháirtithe eile, lena n-áirítear do cheist chuardaigh agus na sonraí lena mbaineann (amhail dáta, am, seoladh IP agus aitheantóir uathúil). Seolfar na sonraí sin chuig Microsoft chun an tseirbhís chuardaigh a sholáthair. Úsáidfidh Microsoft na sonraí sin faoi mar a thuairiscítear sa ráiteas seo nó de réir coinníollacha eile dár n-oibleagáidí conarthacha lenár gcomhpháirtithe. Ba chóir duit féachaint ar pholasaithe príobháideachais na seirbhísí tríú páirtí má bhíonn aon cheisteanna agat maidir le bailiú agus úsáid sonraí.
Cuireadh na sonraí ar aghaidh chuig an spriocshuíomh gréasáin
. Nuair a roghnaíonn tú toradh cuardaigh nó fógra ó leathanach torthaí cuardaigh Bing agus nuair a théann tú chuig an spriocshuíomh gréasáin, gheobhaidh an spriocshuíomh gréasáin na gnáthshonraí a sheolann do bhrabhsálaí chuig gach suíomh gréasáin a n-osclaíonn tú — amhail do sheoladh IP, cineál do bhrabhsálaí agus do theanga, agus óstainm an tsuímh as ar tháinig tú (
https://www.bing.com/
sa chás seo).
Sonraí ó Bing, agus ó eispéiris arna gcumhachtú ag Bing, a chomhroinnt le tríú páirtithe
. Féadfaimid roinnt sonraí dí-aitheanta (sonraí nach bhfuil aitheantas duine sonrach ar eolas) ó Bing, agus ó eispéiris arna gcumhachtú ag Bing a chomhroinnt le tríú páirtithe roghnaithe. Sula ndéanaimid a leithéid, cuirimid na sonraí trí mhodh oibrithe arna dhearadh chun sonraí íogaire áirithe a bhaint, a d'fhéadfadh a bheith curtha san áireamh sna téarmaí cuardaigh ag na húsáideoirí féin (amhail uimhreacha slándála sóisialaí nó uimhreacha cárta creidmheasa). Sa bhreis air sin, éilímid ar na tríú páirtithe sin an fhaisnéis sin a choinneáil slán agus gan na sonraí a úsáid chun aon chríche eile.

Microsoft Edge
Cibé uair a úsáideann tú brabhsálaí Gréasáin chun an t-Idirlíon a rochtain, seoltar sonraí maidir le do ghléas ("sonraí caighdeánacha gléis") chuig na suíomhanna Gréasáin a osclaíonn tú agus na seirbhísí ar líne a úsáideann tú. Áirítear ar shonraí caighdeánacha gléis seoladh IP do ghléis, cineál agus teanga an bhrabhsálaí, amanna rochtana, agus seoltaí gréasáin tarchuir. D'fhéadfaí na sonraí seo a logáil ar fhreastalaithe Gréasáin na suíomhanna Gréasáin nó na seirbhísí ar líne sin. Braitheann an sórt sonraí a lógáiltear agus an úsáid a bhaintear astu ar chleachtais phríobháideachta na suíomhanna gréasáin a osclaíonn tú agus na seirbhísí gréasáin a úsáideann tú. Gnéithe áirithe i Microsoft Edge, mar shampla nuair a osclaíonn tú táb nua sa bhrabhsálaí, ceanglaíonn siad thú le hinneachar Microsoft Start agus ceanglaíonn agus d’eispéiris le hábhar den sórt sin sa rannán Microsoft Start den ráiteas príobháideachta seo. Lena chois sin, seolann Microsoft Edge brabhsálaí ID uathúil chuig láithreáin ghréasáin áirithe chun cur ar ár gcumas sonraí comhiomlána a fhorbairt a úsáidtear chun gnéithe agus seirbhísí brabhsálaí a fheabhsú.
Microsoft Edge le haghaidh Windows, Linux, agus macOS
. Is é Microsoft Edge an brabhsálaí gréasáin réamhshocraithe le haghaidh Windows 10 agus tá sé ar fáil freisin ar leaganacha eile de Windows agus de macOS a bhfuil tacú ann dóibh.
Stóráiltear ar do ghléas sonraí faoin tslí a n-úsáideann tú do bhrabhsálaí, ar nós do stair bhrabhsála, sonraí foirme Gréasáin, comhaid shealadacha idirlín, agus cuacha. Is féidir na sonraí seo a scriosadh ó do ghléas le Scrios Stair Bhrabhsála.
Le Microsoft Edge, is féidir inneachar a ghabháil agus a shábháil ar do ghléas, ar nós:
Socruithe agus Tuilleadh
. Ceadaíonn sé duit do leabharmhairc,ceanáin, íoslódálacha,stair, iarmhír comhadainm agus bailiúcháin a bhainistiú go furasta in aon áit amháin.
Bailiúcháin
. Ceadaíonn sé duit téacsanna,íomhánna, físeáin, agus inneachar eile a bhailiú ar leathanach nóta ar do bhrabhsálaí. Nuair a tharraingíonn tú inneachar chuig do bhailiúchán, cuirtear é i dtaisce ar do ghléas agus féadfar é a scrios trí do bhailiúchán.
Pionna Láithreán Gréasáin ar an Tascbharra
. a cheadaíonn duit na láithreáin ghréasáin is fearr leat a phionnáil ar thascbharra Windows. Beidh láithreáin ghréasáin in ann na leathanaigh ghréasáin dá gcuid atá pionnáilte agat a fheiceáil, ionas gur féidir leo suaitheantas fógra a chur ar fáil duit ionas go mbeidh a fhios agat go bhfuil rud éigin nua ar a láithreáin ghréasáin ar cheart duit breathnú air.
Bailíonn Microsoft sonraí is gá chun gnéithe a iarrann tú a sholáthar i Microsoft Edge. Agus tú sínithe isteach i Microsoft Edge le chuntas Microsoft pearsanta nó oibre nó scoile, sioncrónaíonn Microsoft Edge le do shonraí brabhsálaí atá sábháilte ar ghléas thar gléasann eile atá sínithe isteach. Is féidir leat na sonraí brabhsálaí a shioncronóidh a roghnú, lena n-áirítear do cheanáin, stair bhrabhsála, breiseáin agus sonraí gaolmhara, socruithe, táib oscailte, iontrálacha foirme uathlíonta (mar d'ainm, do sheoladh, agus d'uimhir fóin), pasfhocail, faisnéis íocaíochta, agus cineálacha sonraí eile, faoi mar a thiocfaidh siad chun cinn. Má roghnaíonn tú breisithe a fuair tú ó shiopaí Gréasáin tríú páirtí a shioncronú, íoslódálfar cóip de na breisithe sin go díreach ó na siopaí Gréasáin sin ar do chuid gléasanna sioncronaithe. Má bhíonn Monatóir Pasfhocal casta air agat, déantar d’fhaisnéis aitheantais a haiseáil, a chriptiú agus a sheoladh chuig seirbhís Mhonatóir Pasfhocal Microsoft le rabhadh a thabhairt duit más rud é gur braitheadh d’fhaisnéis aitheantais mar chuid d’ionsaí mailíseach nó sárú. Ní dhéanfaidh Microsoft na sonraí sin a choinneáil nuair a bheidh an tseiceáil thart. Is féidir sioncronú a dhíchumasú nó a chumrú i socruithe Microsoft Edge.
Nuair a shíníonn tú isteach i Microsoft Edge le do chuntas Microsoft phearsanta nó oibre nó scoile, stórálfaidh Microsoft Edge sainroghanna príobháideachais do chuntais. Úsáidfidh Microsoft Edge na sainroghanna sábháilte chun sainroghanna príobháideachais do chuntais thar do ghléasanna sínithe isteach, lena n-áirítear le linn do ghléas Windows a bheith cumraithe nó nuair shíníonn tú isteach le Microsoft Edge ar do chuntas le gléas nua.
Úsáideann
Moltaí cuardaigh agus suímh
Microsoft Edge do cheisteanna cuardaigh agus stair bhrabhsála chun brabhsáil níos tapa agus moltaí cuardaigh níos ábhartha a sholáthar duit. Seolann Microsoft Edge an t-eolas a chlóscríobhann tú isteach i mbarra seoltaí an bhrabhsálaí chuig an soláthraí cuardaigh réamhshocraithe atá cumraithe sa bharra seoltaí chun moltaí cuardaigh a thairiscint duit de réir mar a chlóscríobhann tú. Is féidir na gnéithe seo a chasadh as uair ar bith i socruithe an bhrabhsálaí. Chun torthaí cuardaigh a sholáthar, seolann Microsoft Edge do chuid ceisteanna cuardaigh, faisnéis chaighdeánach cuardaigh agus suíomh (má tá suíomh cumasaithe agat) chuig do sholáthraí cuardaigh réamhshocraithe. Más é Bing do sholáthraí cuardaigh réamhshocraithe, úsáidimid na sonraí seo mar a thuairiscítear i rannán Bing den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Microsoft Edge a bhailíonn agus a úsáideann sonraí ó do ghníomhaíocht chuardaigh ar fud an ghréasáin, lena n-áirítear suíomhanna Gréasáin nach leatsa iad agus a oibríonn Microsoft, chun seirbhísí Microsoft a fheabhsú, ar nós Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Bing agus Microsoft News. D'fhéadfadh an t-iarratas cuardaigh, na torthaí cuardaigh a thaispeántar duit, faisnéis dhoimeagrafach atá mar chuid de na torthaí cuardaigh, agus an t-idirghníomhú atá agat leis na torthaí cuardaigh sin a bheith san áireamh sna sonraí sin, ar nós na nasc a chliceálann tú orthu. Microsoft Edge bearta chun na sonraí a bhailíonn sé a dhí-aithint trí shonraí a bhaint lena sainaithnítear an duine nó an gléas ónar bailíodh iad agus coinnítear na sonraí sin ar feadh bliana amháin ó bhailítear iad. Ní úsáideann Microsoft na sonraí seo a bhailítear chun fógraí a phearsanú ná a chur ar fáil duit. Is féidir na gnéithe seo a chasadh as uair ar bith i socruithe an bhrabhsálaí.
Déanann Microsoft Edge inneachar a íoslódáil ó sheirbhísí Microsoft Edge le d’eispéiris bhrabhsála a fheabhsú; mar shampla, nuair a dhéantar sonraí a íoslódáil chun inneachar suímh a réamhléiriú faoi choinne brabhsáil níos mire nó chun inneachar a sholáthar chun gnéithe is mian leat a úsáid a chumhachtú, amhail teimpléid a chur ar fáil don rannán Bailiúcháin.
Féadfaidh tú rogha a dhéanamh freisin do ghníomhaíocht bhrabhsála Microsoft Edge a chomhroinnt chun ligean dúinn seirbhísí Microsoft Edge agus Seirbhísí Microsoft amhail fógraí, cuardach, siopadóireacht agus nuacht a phearsantú.

SwiftKey
Próiseálann méarchlár Microsoft SwiftKey agus seirbhísí néalbhunaithe gaolmhara (le chéile, na “SwiftKey Services”) sonraí faoi na focail a úsáideann tú agus conas a chlóscríobhann agus a úsáideann tú na sonraí seo chun do stíl scríbhneoireachta a fhoghlaim agus chun uathcheartú pearsanta agus téacs réamh-mheastacháin a chur ar fáil duit a chuireann in oiriúint duit. Bainimid úsáid as na sonraí sin chomh maith chun réimse gnéithe eile a thairiscint amhail tuartha haischlibeanna agus emoji.
Foghlaimíonn teicneolaíocht tuartha SwiftKey ón dóigh a n-úsáideann tú teanga chun samhail teanga pearsantaithe a fhorbairt duit. Dearcadh optamaithe is ea an tsamhail seo de na focail agus na frásaí is mó a úsáideann tú i gcomhthéacs agus léiríonn sé do stíl uathúil scríbhneoireachta. Sa tsamhail í féin beidh na focail a chlóscríobhann tú go minic agus iad eagraithe ar bhealach a chuireann ar a gcumas d’algartaim SwiftKey tuartha a dhéanamh, bunaithe ar théacs atá curtha isteach agat cheana féin. Baintear leas sa tsamhail as gach cás ina n-úsáideann tú do mhéarchlár, lena n-áirítear nuair a chlóscríobhann tú agus tú ag úsáid aipeanna nó ag tabhairt cuairt ar shuíomhanna gréasáin. Ní dhéanann méarchlár agus samhail SwiftKey sonraí a bhailiú ó réimsí áirithe amhail na cinn sin a aithnítear go mbíonn sonraí pasfhocail nó íocaíochta iontu, chun iarracht a dhéanamh gan sonraí íogaire a bhailiú. Ní logáileann ná ní stórálann Seirbhísí SwiftKey na sonraí atá i do mhúnla, ach amháin má roghnaíonn tú do shonraí a roinnt linn (mar a thuairiscítear thíos). Nuair a úsáideann tú SwiftKey Services, bailímíd sonraí an ghléis agus sonraí úsáide chomh maith. Nuair a shíníonn tú isteach i do chuntas SwiftKey agus nuair a aontaíonn tú na sonraí seo a leanas a roinnt, úsáidfimid sonraí gléis dí-shainaitheanta, sonraí úsáide, agus sonraí samhla chun anailís a dhéanamh ar fheidhmíocht seirbhíse agus chun cabhrú lenár dtáirgí a fheabhsú.
Chomh maith, tá comhpháirt roghnach néil ar a dtugtar Cuntas SwiftKey mar chuid de SwiftKey Services. Má roghnaíonn tú Cuntas SwiftKey a chruthú, déanfar do shamhail teanga a shioncronú le néalseirbhís Chuntas SwiftKey, ionas go mbeidh tú in ann tairbhe a bhaint as an tsamhail sin ar na gléasanna éagsúla a úsáideann tú agus rochtain a bheith agat ar sheirbhísí breise amhail sioncronú tuartha agus cúltaca. Nuair a chruthaíonn tú Cuntas SwiftKey, baileoidh Microsoft do sheoladh ríomhphoist agus sonraí bunúsacha déimeagrafacha chomh maith. Déantar na sonraí ar fad a bhailítear a aistriú chuig ár bhfreastalaithe thar chainéil chriptithe. Má tá tú sínithe isteach ar do chuntas SwiftKey, is féidir leat do shonraí pearsanta agus roghanna cuntais SwiftKey a rialú ag
data.swiftkey.com

Is féidir leat liostáil SwiftKey go roghnach chomh maith chun do shonraí teanga agus clóscríofa agus/nó gearrthóga gutha a chomhroinnt d’fhonn táirgí Microsoft a fheabhsú. Ag brath ar na liostálacha roghnacha a roghnaíonn tú, féadfaidh SwiftKey giotaí gearr sonraí a sheoladh faoi na rudaí a chlóscríobhann tú agus/nó do ghearrthóga gutha, agus sonraí ceartaithe gaolmhara chuig ár bhfreastalaithe lena bpróiseáil. Úsáidtear na sleachta téacs seo i bpróisis uathoibrithe éagsúla chun a dheimhniú go bhfuil ár seirbhísí tuartha ag obair i gceart agus chun feabhsuithe táirgí a dhéanamh. Chun do phríobháideachas a chaomhnú, déanann Seirbhísí SwiftKey na blúirí téacs seo a dhí-aithint, agus fiú má tá Cuntas SwiftKey agat, ní bheidh na blúirí téacs seo nasctha leis.
Má shíníonn tú isteach chuig do Chuntas SwiftKey agus má shocraíonn tú do shonraí teanga agus clóscríofa nó gearrthóga gutha a chomhroinnt, déanfaidh Microsoft do sonraí comhroinnte a phróiseáil d’fhonn patrúin nua úsáide teanga a aimsiú ar fud ár n-úsáideoirí ar fad. Cuireann sé seo ar ár gcumas ár samhlacha bunúsacha a fheabhsú do theangacha ar leith. Déantar sonraí teanga agus clóscríobh a úsáidtear sa phróiseas seo a bhailiú le chéile, agus má bhíonn focail nó grúpaí focal a bheadh pearsanta do dhaoine ar leith nó grúpaí beaga úsáideoirí, déantar iad sin a bhaint.
Is féidir leat an cead a thug tú a aistarraingt in am ar bith i dtaca le shonraí teanga agus clóscríofa ar mhaithe le feabhsú táirgí. Déantar sin i Socruithe SwiftKey. Is féidir leat an cead a thug tú a aistarraingt i Socruithe SwiftKey chomh maith, maidir le SwiftKey Services do shonraí pearsanta a choimeád Nuair a dhéanann tú an cead a aistarraingt maidir le SwiftKey do shonraí a choimeád, déanfar na sonraí go léir a bailíodh de thoradh ar an úsáid a bhain tú as Seirbhísí SwiftKey a scriosadh.
Seans go bhfaighidh tú fógraí ar do ghléas ó am go chéile a chuirfidh thú ar an eolas maidir le nuashonruithe táirgí agus gnéithe a d’fhéadfadh a bheith suimiúil duit. Féadfaidh tú na fógraí sin inár dtáirgí a dhíchumasú aon uair i Socruithe SwiftKey.
Nuair a úsáideann tú an ghné ceamara i SwiftKey, is féidir leat rogha a dhéanamh d’fhíseáin agus d’íomhánna a fheabhsú le seirbhísí lionsaí tríú páirtí. Is gné é Lionsa a úsáideann Réaltacht Mhéadaithe (RA) chun do fhéiníní a athrú ar bhealach spraíúil, mar shampla cuma a chur ort mar an t-ainmhí is fearr leat. Ag baint úsáide as an gceamara ar mhéarchlár SwiftKey, is féidir leat an ghné lionsa atá corpraithe sa mhéarchlár a roghnú chun d’aghaidh agus do lámha a athrú. Ag brath ar an lionsa a roghnaíonn tú, is féidir d'fhíseáin agus d'íomhánna a phróiseáil chun faisnéis a bhaint amach faoi shuíomh áiteanna éagsúla ar d'aghaidh agus ar do lámha. Úsáidtear na sonraí asbhainte chun éifeachtaí RA a chur i bhfeidhm ar d’aghaidh agus ar do lámha amháin. Ní úsáidtear aon cheann de na sonraí seo chun tú a aithint go pearsanta. Déantar na sonraí seo a phróiseáil ar feadh an tseisiúin ar do ghléas amháin, agus ansin scriostar láithreach iad. Ní sheoltar na sonraí seo chuig SwiftKey nó chuig aon tríú páirtí.

Áirítear in eispéiris shaincheaptha moltaí maidir le conas Windows a shaincheapadh agus a bharrfheabhsú, chomh maith le fógraí agus moltaí le haghaidh táirgí agus seirbhísí, gnéithe, feidhmchláir agus crua-earraí Microsoft agus tríú páirtí le haghaidh d'eispéiris Windows. Mar shampla, d'fhéadfadh Windows insint duit faoi ghnéithe nua chun cabhrú leat an leas is fearr a bhaint as do ghléas. Má shruthaíonn tú scannáin i do bhrabhsálaí, is féidir go molfaidh Windows feidhmchlár duit ón Microsoft Store, feidhmchlár a shruthaíonn ar shlí níos éifeachtaí. Nó, má tá tú ag rith as spás ar do thiomántán crua, is féidir go molfaidh Windows duit triail a bhaint as OneDrive nó crua-earraí a cheannach chun tuilleadh spáis a fháil.
Nuair a bhíonn tairiscintí pearsantaithe ar siúl, féadfaidh Windows do shonraí diagnóiseacha riachtanacha a úsáid chun tairiscintí a phearsantú. D’fhéadfadh faisnéis maidir le do ghléas, a shocruithe agus a chumais, agus cibé an bhfuil sé ag obair i gceart nó nach bhfuil a bheith san áireamh sna sonraí seo.

Eispéiris shaincheaptha
Tá tairiscintí pearsantaithe á gcur in ionad eispéiris shaincheaptha i leaganacha níos déanaí de Windows. Mura bhfuil an Windows Update is déanaí suiteáilte agat, b'fhéidir go bhfeicfidh tú eispéiris shaincheaptha ar do ghléas fós.
Má roghnaíonn tú Eispéiris shaincheaptha a chasadh air, úsáidfimid do shonraí diagnóiseacha Windows (Bunúsach nó Iomlán, mar a roghnaigh tú) chun leideanna, fógraí, agus moltaí pearsantaithe a thairiscint duit chun táirgí agus seirbhísí Microsoft a bhreisiú chun do riachtanais a chomhlíonadh. Má roghnaigh tú Bunúsach mar do shocrú sonraí diagnóiseacha, bunaítear pearsantú ar fhaisnéis maidir le do ghléas, a shocruithe agus cumais, agus cibé an bhfuil sé ag obair i gceart. Má roghnaigh tú Iomlán, bunaítear pearsantú ar fhaisnéis maidir leis na láithreáin ghréasáin a bhrabhsálann tú chomh maith, conas a úsáideann tú feidhmchláir agus gnéithe, mar aon le faisnéis bhreise maidir le sláinte do ghléis. Ní úsáidimid eolas i dtaobh na suíomhanna Gréasáin a bhrabhsálann tú, a bhfuil i ndumpaí tuairteála, sonraí ionchuir cainte, clóscríbhneoireachta, nó breactha dúigh chun pearsantú a dhéanamh, áfach, nuair a fhaighimid sonraí den sórt sin ó chustaiméirí a bhfuil Iomlán roghnaithe acu. Seoltar na sonraí sin ar aghaidh chuig Microsoft agus stóráiltear iad le haitheantóir uathúil amháin nó níos mó a chabhróidh linn úsáideoir aonair a shainaithint ar ghléas aonair, agus saincheisteanna seirbhíse agus patrúin úsáide an ghléis a thuiscint.
Áirítear in eispéiris shaincheaptha moltaí maidir le conas Windows a shaincheapadh agus a bharrfheabhsú, chomh maith le fógraí agus moltaí le haghaidh táirgí agus seirbhísí, gnéithe, feidhmchláir agus crua-earraí Microsoft agus tríú páirtí le haghaidh d'eispéiris Windows. Mar shampla, chun cabhrú leat gach buntáiste a bhaint as do ghléas, is féidir go n-inseoimid duit faoi ghnéithe nach eol duit nó gnéithe nua. Má tá fadhb agat le do ghléas Windows, is féidir go dtairgfear réiteach duit. Is féidir go dtairgfear deis duit chun do scáileán glasála a shaincheapadh le pictiúir, nó tuilleadh pictiúr den chineál a thaithníonn leat, nó níos lú den chineál nach dtaitníonn leat, a fheiceáil. Má shruthaíonn tú scannáin i do bhrabhsálaí, is féidir go molfar feidhmchlár duit ón Microsoft Store, a shruthaíonn ar shlí níos éifeachtaí. Nó, má tá tú ag rith as spás ar do thiomántán crua, is féidir go molfaidh Windows duit triail a bhaint as OneDrive nó crua-earraí a cheannach chun tuilleadh spáis a fháil.

Lárionad Aiseolais
Is feidhmchlár réamhshuiteáilte é Lárionad Aiseolais a sholáthraíonn bealach chun aiseolas maidir le táirgí Microsoft agus feidhmchláir suiteáilte céad agus tríú páirtí a bhailiú. Nuair a úsáideann tú Lárionad Aiseolais. Léann Lárionad Aiseolais go tréimhsiúil an liosta feidhmchlár suiteáilte chun aipeanna a chinneadh ar féidir aiseolas a sheoladh ina leith. Cinneann an Mol Aiseolais na haipeanna atá suiteáilte ar do ghléas trí API poiblí. Ina theannta sin, le haghaidh HoloLens, baineann Feedback Hub úsáid as do cheamara agus do mhicreafón nuair a roghnaíonn tú do thimpeallacht agus d’fhuaim ionchurtha a roinnt. Baineann sé úsáid freisin as an leabharlann grianghraif agus comhaid chun seatanna scáileáin agus taifeadtaí scáileáin a rochtain a chuireann tú faoi iamh le seoladh mar chuid den aiseolas.
Féadfaidh tú síniú isteach sa Lárionad Aiseolais trí úsáid a bhaint as do chuntas Microsoft pearsanta nó as cuntas atá curtha ar fáil ag d'eagraíocht (amhail d'fhostóir nó scoil) a úsáideann tú chun síniú isteach i dtáirgí Microsoft. Má shíníonn tú isteach le do chuntas oibre nó scoile ceadaítear duit aiseolas a chur ar fáil do Microsoft i gcomhpháirt le d’eagraíocht. D’fhéadfadh go mbeadh an t-aiseolas a sholáthraíonn tú nuair a úsáideann tú do chuntas oibre nó scoile nó do chuntas pearsanta Microsoft, infheicthe ag an bpobal, ag brath ar na socruithe atá cumraithe ag riarthóirí na heagraíochta. Ina theannta sin, má chuirtear aiseolas ar fáil trí úsáid a bhaint as do chuntas oibre nó scoile, is féidir le riarthóirí na heagraíochta féachaint ar an aiseolas tríd an Lárionad aiseolais.
Nuair a sheolann tú aiseolas faoi fhadhb chuig Microsoft, nó nuair a chuireann tú sonraí breise le fadhb, seolfar sonraí diagnóiseacha chuig Microsoft chun táirgí agus seirbhísí Microsoft a fheabhsú. Ag brath ar do shocruithe sonraí diagnóiseacha sa rannán

Seirbhísí suímh, brath gluaisne, agus taifeadadh
Seirbhís suímh Windows
. Cuireann Microsoft seirbhís suímh i bhfeidhm a chabhraíonn chun suíomh beacht geografach gléas sonrach Windows a dhearbhú. Ag brath ar chumais an ghléis, is féidir suíomh an ghléis a chinneadh le leibhéil éagsúla chruinnis agus d'fhéadfaí é a chinneadh go beacht i gcásanna áirithe. Nuair a bhíonn suíomh cumasaithe agat ar ghléas Windows, nó nuair atá cead tugtha agat d'fheidhmchláir Microsoft faisnéis suímh a rochtain ar ghléasanna nach gléasanna Windows iad, bailíonn Microsoft sonraí maidir le túir chille agus pointí rochtana Wi-Fi agus a gcuid suíomhanna agus cuirtear na sonraí sin leis an mbunachar sonraí suímh nuair a bhíonn aon sonraí a d'fhéadfadh a bheith mar bhonn leis an duine nó an gléas ónár bailíodh na sonraí curtha as an áireamh. Úsáidtear an eolas súimh neamh-aitheanta seo le seirbhísí suímh Microsoft a fheabhsú.
Is féidir le seirbhísí agus gnéithe Windows (amhail brabhsálaithe agus Cortana), feidhmchláir atá ag rith ar Windows, agus láithreáin ghréasáin atá oscailte i mbrabhsálaithe Windows rochtain a fháil ar shuíomh an ghléis trí Windows má cheadaíonn do shocruithe dóibh é sin a dhéanamh. Iarrann gnéithe agus feidhmchláir áirithe cead suímh nuair a shuiteálann tú Windows den chéad uair, iarrann cuid acu é an chéad uair a úsáideann tú an feidhmchlár, agus iarrann cuid eile é gach uair a mbíonn rochtain agat ar shuíomh an ghléis. Tá faisnéis maidir leis na cineálacha áirithe feidhmchlár de chuid Windows a úsáideann suíomh an ghléis le fáil i rannán
feidhmchláir Windows
den ráiteas príobháideachais seo.
Nuair a bhíonn rochtain ag feidhmchlár nó ag gné ar shuíomh an ghléis agus nuair atá tú sínithe isteach le do chuntas Microsoft, déanfaidh do ghléas Windows a shuíomh a uaslódáil chuig an néal áit a mbeidh sé ar fáil ar do ghléasanna d'fheidhmchláir nó do sheirbhísí eile a úsáideann do chuntas Microsoft agus a bhfuil cead tugtha duit iad a úsáid. Ní choimeádfaimid ach an suíomh deireanach a bhí ar eolas (tagann gach suíomh nua in ionad an tsuímh roimhe). Stóráiltear sonraí maidir le stair suímh is déanaí ghléas Windows freisin ar an ngléas fiú mura bhfuil cuntas Microsoft in úsáid, agus is féidir le feidhmchláir agus gnéithe áirithe de chuid Windows rochtain a fháil ar an stair suímh seo. Is féidir leat stair suímh do ghléis a ghlanadh am ar bith i roghchlár socruithe Windows.
San feidhchlar Socruithe Windows, chomh maith leis sin feicfidh tú go bhfuil rochtain ag feidhmchláir ar shuíomh beacht an ghléis nó ar stair suímh do ghléis, is féidir rochtain ar shuíomh an ghléis le haghaidh feidhmchláir áirithe a chasadh as nó air, nó is féidir rochtain ar shuíomh an ghléis a chasadh as. Féadfaidh tú suíomh réamhshocraithe a shocrú chomh maith, a úsáidfear nuair nach féidir an tseirbhís suímh suíomh níos beaichte a roghnú don ghléas.
Tá roinnt eisceachtaí ar conas is féidir suíomh do ghléis a chinneadh nach bhfuil faoi bhainistíocht dhíreach na socruithe suímh.
Is cineál feidhmchláir ar leith iad feidhmchlár deisce nach n-iarrfaidh cead ar leith chun faisnéis shuíomh do ghléis a aimsiú agus nach mbeidh le feiceáil sa liosta óna roghnaíonn tú na feidhmchláir ar féidir leo do shuíomh a úsáid. Is féidir iad a íoslódáil ón Microsoft Store, ón Idirlíon nó a shuiteáil le cineálacha áirithe meáin (ar nós CD, DVD, nó gléas stórais USB). Lainseáiltear iad le comhad .EXE nó. DLL, agus de ghnáth ritheann siad ar do ghléas, murab ionann agus feidhmchláir bunaithe ar an nGréasán (a ritheann sa néal).
Faigh tuilleadh faisnéise faoi fheidhmchláir deisce tríú páirtí agus an chaoi a d'fhéadfaidís a bheith in ann suíomh do ghléis a chinneadh nuair atá socrú suímh an ghléis casta as
.
D'fhéadfadh feidhmchláir agus seirbhísí tríú páirtí áirithe a bhfuil ar fáil ar Windows teicneolaíochtaí eile a úsáid (cosúil le Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, móideim ceallach etc.) nó seirbhísí suímh néalbhunaithe le suíomh do ghléis a chinneadh le céimeanna éagsúla cruinnis fiú nuair a bhíonn socrú shuíomh an ghléis casta as agat.
I dteannta le cabhair a fháil i gcás éigeandála a éascú, uair ar bith a dhéanann tú glao éigeandála, déanfaidh Windows iarracht do shuíomh beacht a chinneadh agus a chomhroinnt, beag beann ar do shocruithe suímh. Má tá cárta SIM i do ghléas nó ná tá seirbhís cheallach in úsáid ar bhealach éigin eile, beidh rochtain ag d'oibreoir móibíleach ar shuíomh do ghléis.

Aimsigh mo ghléas
. Ceadaíonn an ghné Aimsigh mo gléas do riarthóir ghléas iniompartha Windows suíomh an ghléis sin a aimsiú ó account.microsoft.com/devices. Chun Aimsigh mo ghléas a chumasú, ní mór go mbeadh riarthóir sínithe isteach le cuntas Microsoft agus go mbeadh an socrú suímh cumasaithe. Oibreoidh an ghné seo fiú amháin má tá rochtain ar shuíomh diúltaithe ag úsáideoirí eile dá bhfeidhmchláir uile. Nuair a dhéanann an riarthóir iarracht an gléas a aimsiú, feicfidh úsáideoirí fógra sa limistéar fógra.

SmartScreen Microsoft Defender agus Rialú Feidhmchlár Cliste
. Oibríonn Microsoft chun cabhrú le do ghléas agus do phasfhocail a chosaint ó fheidhmchláir, comhaid agus inneachar gréasáin neamhshábháilte.
Cabhraíonn SmartScreen Microsoft Defender leat a chosaint agus tú ag úsáid ár seirbhísí trí bagairtí ortsa, ar do ghléas nó ar do phasfhocail. Is féidir feidhmchláir nó inneachar gréasán a d'fhéadfadh a bheith neamhshábháilte a aimsíonn SmartScreen Microsoft Defender agus é ag seiceáil suíomhanna a thugann tú cuairt orthu, comhaid a íoslódálann tú agus feidhmchláir a suiteálann agus ritheann tú a bheith curtha san áireamh sna bagairtí seo. Agus SmartScreen Microsoft Defender ag seiceáil inneachar feidhmchlár agus Gréasáin, seoltar sonraí maidir leis an inneachar agus do ghléas chuig Microsoft, lena n-áirítear seoladh iomlán Gréasáin an inneachair. Nuair a bhíonn gá le hanailís bhreise chun bagairtí slándála a aithint, féadfar faisnéis faoin suíomh gréasáin nó faoi bhfeidhmchlár amhrasach—amhail an t-inneachar a thaispeántar, na fuaimeanna a seinntear agus cuimhne feidhmchláir—a sheoladh chuig Microsoft. Ní bhainfear úsáid as na sonraí seo ach chun críocha slándála chun teagmhais slándála, goid céannachta, calaoise, nó gníomhaíochtaí mailíseacha, meabhlacha nó mídhleathacha eile a bhrath, a chosaint ina gcoinne agus chun freagairt dóibh. Má bhraitheann SmartScreen Microsoft Defender go bhféadfadh inneachar a bheith neamhshábháilte, feicfidh tú fógra foláirimh in áit an inneachair. Is féidir SmartScreen Microsoft Defender a chasadh air nó as sa feidhmchlár Slándáil Windows.
Sna cásanna a thacaítear leis, cabhraíonn Rialú Feidhmchlár Cliste le bogearraí atá suiteáilte agus a ritheann ar do ghléas a sheiceáil chun cinntiú má tá sé mailíseach, gan iarraidh b’fhéidir, nó má tá bagairtí ar tusa agus do ghléas eile i gceist. Ar ghléas tacaithe, tosaíonn Rialú Feidhmchlár Cliste i mód meastóireachta agus úsáidtear na sonraí a bhailímid ar son SmartScreen Microsoft Defender amhail ainm comhaid, heais d'inneachar an chomhaid, suíomh an íoslódála, agus deimhnithe digiteacha an chomhaid, chun cinntiú má tá do ghléas ina iarrathóir maith chun Rialú Feidhmchlár Cliste a úsáid le haghaidh cosaint slándála breise.

Caint, gníomhachtú gutha, breacadh dúigh agus clóscríobh
Caint
. Cuireann Microsoft gné aitheanta cainte ghléasbhunaithe agus teicneolaíochtaí aithint cainte néalbhunaithe (ar líne) ar fáil.
Ach an socrú aitheanta cainte ar líne a chasadh air, ceadaíonn sé d'fheidhmchláir aithint cainte néalbhunaithe Microsoft a úsáid. Lena chois sin, Windows 10, cumasaíonn an socrú aitheanta cainte ar líne do chumas deachtú a úsáid laistigh de Windows.
Má chasann tú caint air agus tú ag cumrú gléas HoloLens nó ag suiteáil Windows Mixed Reality, beidh tú in ann do ghuth a úsáid d'orduithe, deachtú agus idirghníomhaíochtaí feidhmchláir. Cumasófar aithint cainte gléasbhunaithe agus socruithe aitheanta cainte ar líne araon. Agus an dá shocrú cumasaithe, beidh an gléas ag éisteacht le d'ionchur gutha fad a bhíonn do ghléas cinn casta air agat, agus seolfar do shonraí gutha chuig teicneolaíochtaí aithint cainte néalbhunaithe Microsoft.
Nuair a úsáideann tú teicneolaíochtaí aitheanta cainte néalbhunaithe ó Microsoft, cibé an gcumasaítear iad leis an socrú aitheanta cainte ar líne nó nuair a idirghníomhaíonn tú le HoloLens nó le clóscríobh gutha, bailíonn agus úsáideann Microsoft do thaifeadtaí gutha chun an tseirbhís aitheanta cainte a sholáthar trí thras-scríobh téacs de na focail labhartha sna sonraí gutha a chruthú. Ní stórálfaidh Microsoft, ní samplálfaidh Microsoft agus ní éistfidh Microsoft le do thaifeadtaí gutha gan do chead. Chun tuilleadh faisnéise a fháil faoin gcaoi a ndéanann Microsoft bainistíocht ar do shonraí gutha, féach
teicneolaíochtaí Aithint cainte
.
Is féidir leat aithint cainte gléasbhunaithe a úsáid gan do shonraí gutha a sheoladh chuig Microsoft. Mar sin féin, cuireann teicneolaíochtaí aithint cainte néalbhunaithe Microsoft cumas aitheanta níos cruinne ar fáil ná mar a dhéanann an aithint cainte gléasbhunaithe. Nuair atá an socrú aitheanta cainte ar líne casta as, oibreoidh seirbhísí cainte nach mbraitheann ar an néal agus a bhaineann úsáid as aithint gléasbhunaithe amháin - amhail fotheidil bheo, Narrator, nó rochtain gutha - fós agus ní bhaileoidh Microsoft aon sonraí gutha.
Is féidir leat aithint cainte ar líne a chasadh as am ar bith. Stopfaidh sé seo aon fheidhmchláir a bhraitheann ar an socrú aitheanta cainte ar líne ó do shonraí gutha a sheoladh chuig Microsoft. Má tá gléas cinn á úsáid HoloLens nó Windows Mixed Reality, is féidir aithint cainte gléasbhunaithe a chasadh as uair ar bith. Ciallóidh sé sin nach féidir leis an ngléas bheith ag éisteacht le d'ionchur gutha.

Gníomhachtú Gutha
. Soláthraíonn Windows feidhmchláir faoi thacaíocht leis an gcumas freagairt a thabhairt agus gníomhú bunaithe ar eochairfhocail gutha a bhaineann go sonrach leis an bhfeidhmchlár sin—mar shampla ligean do Cortana éisteacht le "Hey Cortana" agus freagairt a thabhairt uirthi.
Má tá cead tugtha agat d'fheidhmchlár éisteacht le haghaidh eochairfhocail ghutha, beidh Windows ag éisteacht go gníomhach leis an micreafón le haghaidh na n-eochairfhocal sin. A luaithe a aithnítear eochairfhocal, beidh rochtain ag an bhfeidhmchlár ar do thaifeadadh gutha, agus is féidir leis an taifeadadh a phróiseáil, gníomhú, agus freagairt a dhéanamh, le freagra labhartha, mar shampla. Is féidir go seolfaidh an feidhmchlár an taifeadadh gutha chuig a sheirbhísí féin sa néal chun na horduithe a phróiseáil. Ba chóir go n-iarrfadh gach feidhmchlár cead ort sula n-osclaíonn sé taifeadtaí gutha.
Lena chois sin, is féidir gníomhachtú gutha a chumasú fad a bhíonn an gléas glasáilte. Má chumasaítear é, leanfaidh an feidhmchlár lena mbaineann ar aghaidh ar éisteacht leis an micreafón d'eochairfhocail, fad a bhíonn do ghléas glasáilte, agus is féidir leis gníomhachtú do dhuine ar bith a labhraíonn gar don ghléas. Nuair a bhíonn an gléas glasáilte, beidh rochtain ag an bhfeidhmchlár ar an tacar céanna cumas agus eolais agus a bhíonn fad a bhíonn an gléas díghlasáilte.
Is féidir gníomhachtú gutha a chasadh as uair ar bith.

.
Clóscríobh gutha
. I Windows 11, nuashonraíodh deachtú agus athainmníodh é mar chlóscríobh gutha. Fheadainn an clóscríobh gutha teicneolaíochtaí aitheanta cainte gléasbhunaithe agus ar líne a úsáid chun a sheirbhís tras-scríobh cainte go téacs a chumhachtú. Is féidir leat roghnú gearrthóga gutha a chur ar fáil, leis, chun clóscríobh gutha a fheabhsú. Má roghnaíonn tú gan gearrthóga gutha a chur ar fáil, is féidir leat clóscríobh gutha a úsáid go fóill. Is féidir do rogha a athrú am ar bith sna socruithe clóscríobh gutha. Ní stórálfaidh Microsoft, ní samplálfaidh Microsoft agus ní éistfidh Microsoft le do thaifeadtaí gutha gan do chead.

Rochtain ghutha
. Cuireann Windows cumas ar gach duine, lena n-airítear daoine faoi mhíchumas gluaiseachta, a ríomhaire pearsanta a rialú agus téacs a scríobh lena guth. Mar shampla, tacaíonn rochtain ghutha le cásanna amhail ag oscailt, agus bogadh idir, feidhmchláir, ag brabhsáil ar líne, agus ag scríobh ríomhphost. Treisíonn rochtain ghutha aithint cainte comhaimseartha gléasbhunaithe chun caint a aithint go cruinn agus tacaítear leis gan nasc Idirlín. Nuair a spreagann úsáideoir rochtain ghutha, úsáideann sé an maidhc ar an gléas.

Dúigh & Pearsanú clóscríofa
. Bailítear d'fhocail chlóscríofa agus lámhscríofa chun liosta focail saincheaptha, aithint carachtar níos fearr chun cabhrú leat clóscríobh agus scríobh ar do ghléas, agus moltaí téacs a bhíonn le feiceáil nuair a bhíonn tú ag clóscríobh nó ag scríobh a chur ar fáil duit.
Is féidir leat Breacadh Dúigh & pearsantú clóscríbhneoireachta a chasadh as am ar bith. Scriosfaidh sé seo do liosta focal custaiméir atá stóráilte ar do ghléas. Má chasann tú é air arís, beidh ort do liosta focal saincheaptha a athchruthú.

Brabhsálaithe Gréasáin—Oidhreacht Microsoft Edge agus Internet Explorer
Baineann an chuid seo le leaganacha oidhreachta de Microsoft Edge (leagan 44 agus faoina bhun). Féach an rannán
Microsoft Edge
den ráiteas príobháideachais chun faisnéis a fháil faoi leaganacha nach leaganacha oidhreachta de Microsoft Edge iad.
Is é Microsoft Edge brabhsálaí réamhshocraithe Gréasáin Microsoft le haghaidh Windows. Gheofar Internet Explorer, brabhsálaí oidhreachta Microsoft, in Windows freisin. Gach uair a úsáideann tú brabhsálaí Gréasáin chun an t-idirlíon a rochtain, seoltar sonraí maidir le do ghléas ("sonraí caighdeánacha gléis") chuig na suíomhanna Gréasáin a osclaíonn tú agus na seirbhísí ar líne a úsáideann tú. Áirítear ar shonraí caighdeánacha gléis seoladh IP do ghléis, cineál agus teanga an bhrabhsálaí, amanna rochtana, agus seoltaí gréasáin tarchuir. D'fhéadfaí na sonraí seo a logáil ar fhreastalaithe Gréasáin na suíomhanna Gréasáin sin. Braitheann an sórt sonraí a lógáiltear agus an úsáid a bhaintear astu ar chleachtais phríobháideachta na suíomhanna gréasáin a osclaíonn tú agus na seirbhísí gréasáin a úsáideann tú. Lena chois sin, seolann Microsoft Edge brabhsálaí ID uathúil chuig láithreáin ghréasáin áirithe chun cur ar ár gcumas sonraí comhiomlána a fhorbairt a úsáidtear chun gnéithe agus seirbhísí brabhsálaí a fheabhsú.
Ina theannta sin, stóráiltear ar do ghléas sonraí faoin tslí a n-úsáideann tú do bhrabhsálaí, ar nós do stair bhrabhsála, sonraí foirme Gréasáin, comhaid shealadacha idirlín, agus cuacha. Is féidir na sonraí seo a scriosadh ó do ghléas le Scrios Stair Bhrabhsála.
Le Microsoft Edge, is féidir inneachar a ghabháil agus a shábháil ar do ghléas, ar nós:
Nóta Gréasáin
. Ligeann sé duit anótálacha dúigh agus téacs a chruthú ar na leathanaigh Ghréasáin a osclaíonn tú, agus iad a ghearradh, a shábháil, nó a chomhroinnt.
Léitheoireacht ghníomhach
. Ligeann sé duit liostaí léitheoireachta a chruthú agus a bhainistiú, lena n-áirítear suíomhanna Gréasáin agus doiciméid.
Lárionad
. Ceadaíonn sé duit do liostaí léitheoireachta, ceanáin, íoslódálacha, agus stair a bhainistiú go furasta in aon áit amháin.
Pionna Láithreán Gréasáin ar an Tascbharra
. a cheadaíonn duit na láithreáin ghréasáin is fearr leat a phionnáil ar thascbharra Windows. Beidh láithreáin ghréasáin in ann na leathanaigh ghréasáin dá gcuid atá pionnáilte agat a fheiceáil, ionas gur féidir leo suaitheantas fógra a chur ar fáil duit ionas go mbeidh a fhios agat go bhfuil rud éigin nua ar a láithreáin ghréasáin ar cheart duit breathnú air.
Déanfar roinnt faisnéise brabhsálaí Microsoft a shábháiltear ar do ghléas a shioncronú ar ghléasanna eile nuair a shíníonn tú isteach le do chuntas Microsoft. Mar shampla, in Internet Explorer, áirítear ar an bhfaisnéis seo do stair bhrabhsála agus ceanáin; agus in Microsoft Edge, áirítear air do cheanáin, liostaí léitheoireachta, iontrálacha uathlíonta foirme, (amhail d'ainm, seoladh agus uimhir fóin), agus d’fhéadfadh sonraí le haghaidh breisithe a shuiteáil bheith san áireamh leis. Mar shampla, má shioncronaíonn tú do liosta léitheoireachta Microsoft Edge ar ghléasanna eile, seolfar cóipeanna den inneachar a roghnaíonn tú a shábháil chuig do liosta léitheoireachta chuig gach gléas sioncronaithe le féachaint air níos déanaí.

in Internet Explorer an fhaisnéis a chlóscríobhann tú i mbarra seoltaí an bhrabhsálaí go huathoibríoch chuig do sholáthraí cuardaigh réamhshocraithe (amhail Bing) chun moltaí cuardaigh a thairiscint de réir mar a chlóscríobhann tú gach carachtar.
Seolann
moltaí cuardaigh agus suímh
in Microsoft Edge go huathoibríoch an fhaisnéis a chlóscríobhann tú i mbarra seoltaí an bhrabhsálaí chuig Bing (fiú má tá soláthraí cuardaigh réamhshocraithe eile roghnaithe agat) chun moltaí cuardaigh a thairiscint de réir mar a chlóscríobhann tú gach carachtar.
Is féidir na gnéithe seo a chasadh as uair ar bith. Chun torthaí cuardaigh a sholáthar, seolann Microsoft Edge agus Internet Explorer do chuid ceisteanna cuardaigh, faisnéis chaighdeánach cuardaigh agus suíomh (má tá suíomh cumasaithe agat) chuig do sholáthraí cuardaigh réamhshocraithe.

‘Athchuimhnigh’ Windows
Is gné de chuid Windows é ‘Athchuimhnigh’ nach bhfuil ar fáil ach ar CoPilot+ PC a ligeann d'úsáideoirí rudaí a chonaic siad ar a ngléas a aimsiú ag baint úsáide as an téacs agus na leideanna amhairc a bhfuil cuimhne acu orthu. Chun Athchuimhnigh a úsáid, ní mór d'úsáideoir liostáil chun alaghraif a shábháil ar Copilot+ PC, ar íomhánna iad de gach rud atá oscailte agus infheicthe ar scáileán an úsáideora a bhfuil meiteashonraí gaolmhara ar nós ainm an fheidhmchláir agus stampa ama-dháta san áireamh iontu . Stóráiltear na sonraí ar fad go logánta ar an ngléas agus tá siad cosanta ag Slándáil Sínithe Isteach Feabhsaithe (ESS) Windows Hello, a sholáthraíonn síniú isteach bithmhéadrach níos sláine agus a chabhraíonn lena chinntiú nach bhfuil rochtain ar fhaisnéis na gcustaiméirí ach ag an custaiméir féin. Gach uair a lainseálann daoine ‘Athchuimhnigh’ iarrfar orthu fíordheimhniú a dhéanamh le síniú isteach bithmhéadrach Windows Hello nó le PIN sula ndíchripteofar an t-inneachar i bhfillteán na n-alaghraf. Ritheann Cliceáil le Déanamh ar bharr alaghraf in Athchuimhnigh agus cabhraíonn sé le húsáideoirí rudaí a dhéanamh ar shlí níos tapúla trí ligean dóibh gníomhartha a dhéanamh lena gcuid inneachar, íomhánna nó téacs ar an scáileán. Déantar anailís ar na halaghraif go logánta ar an ngléas i gcónaí agus athraíonn na gníomhartha atá ar fáil de réir an chineáil inneachair a bhraitear.
Ligeann Athchuimhnigh duit freisin mhicreafón do ghléas Copilot+ PC a úsáid chun téacs a chuardach sna halaghraif a gabhadh. Má chliceálann tú ar an gcnaipe micreafóin atá suite taobh istigh den bhosca ionchuir cuardaigh laistigh d’fhuinneog ‘Athchuimhnigh’, tosaíonn sé ag éisteacht leis an méid a deirtear agus cuireann sé isteach sa bhosca cuardaigh é. Fanann an micreafón in úsáid go dtí go gcuireann tú do chuid cainte ar sos , agus ag an bpointe sin múchtar é go dtí go mbrúnn tú an cnaipe micreafóin go sonrach arís. Aibhseofar na meaitseanna ar fad ón gcuardach sna torthaí. Ní sheoltar an fhuaim a ghabhann an micreafón taobh amuigh den ghléas.
Fanann na sonraí a ghabhann Athchuimhnigh, sonraí pearsanta (m.sh., seatanna, meiteashonraí, torthaí próiseála, agus fiosruithe úsáideora) ina measc, ar an ngléas logánta laistigh den chuntas sínithe isteach ina bhfuil tú sínithe isteach ar an  Copilot+ PC, agus ní sheoltar taobh amuigh den ghléas iad mura ndéanann tú gníomh áirithe. Mar shampla, má dhéanann tú alaghraf a chóipeáil agus a ghreamú isteach i bhfeidhmchlár eile, nó má roghnaíonn tú alaghraf a chur ann agus aiseolas á chur isteach agat trí Lárionad Aiseolais Windows. Is é an t-aon bhealach chun inneachar ó Athchuimhnigh a chomhroinnt le duine ná trí ghníomh soiléir an úsáideora ar an ngléas féin.
Is féidir leat do chuid inneachar (mar shampla Alaghraif, meiteashonraí, ceisteanna cuardaigh, agus stair) a rialú trí alaghraif a úsáid nó a scriosadh, inneachar a scagadh nó trí bhrabhsálaí tacaithe a úsáid i mód príobháideach. Faigh tuilleadh eolais faoi do phríobháideacht agus faoi rialú d’eispéiris ‘Athchuimhnigh’

Xbox
Is é líonra Xbox an tseirbhís ar líne de chuid Microsoft do chluichíocht agus siamsaíocht ar líne atá comhdhéanta de bhogearraí agus eispéiris ar líne thar ardáin éagsúla. Ligeann an tseirbhís duit cluichí a aimsiú agus a imirt, inneachar a rochtain agus ceangal le cairde ar Xbox agus ar líonraí cluichíochta agus sóisialta eile.
Nuair a chláraíonn tú le haghaidh phróifíl Xbox, sannaimid leasainm cluichire (leasainm poiblí) agus aitheantóir uathúil. Nuair a shíníonn tú isteach ar ghléasanna, feidhmchláir agus seirbhísí Xbox, úsáidtear an t-aitheantóir uathúil nó na haitheantóirí uathúla sin chun na sonraí a bhailímid faoin úsáid agat a stóráil.
Is gléasanna iad consóil Xbox ar féidir cluichí, scannáin, ceol agus cineálacha siamsaíochta digití eile a aimsiú agus a imirt nó a sheinm orthu. Chomh maith leis sin, déanaimid aitheantóir uathúil gléis a shannadh nuair a shíníonn tú isteach ar eispéiris Xbox — i bhfeidhmchláir nó ar chonsól. Nuair a bhíonn do chonsól Xbox ceangailte leis an Idirlíon, mar shampla, agus nuair a shíníonn tú isteach ar an gconsól, aithnímid an consól agus an leagan de chóras oibriúcháin an chonsóil atá in úsáid agat.
Sonraí a bhailímid faoi
úsáid seirbhísí, cluichí, feidhmchlár agus consól Xbox agat, cuimsíonn siad:
Nuair a shíníonn tú isteach ar Xbox agus amach as, na cluichí a imríonn tú agus na feidhmchláir a úsáideann tú, dul chun cinn do chluiche, d’éachtaí agus staidreamh faoi do chluichí, na rudaí a cheannaíonn tú agus an t-inneachar a fhaigheann tú.
Na cluichí a imríonn tú agus na feidhmchláir a úsáideann tú, dul chun cinn an chluiche, gnóthachtáil, am imirt in aghaidh an chluiche, agus staitisticí eile maidir le súgartha.
Sonraí feidhmíochta faoi chonsóil Xbox, Xbox Game Pass agus feidhmchláir eile Xbox, líonra Xbox, gléasanna nasctha, agus do nasc líonra, lena n-áirítear earráidí bogearraí nó crua-earraí.
An t-inneachar arna chur leis, arna uaslódáil nó arna chomhroinnt agat trí líonra Xbox, lena n-áirítear téacs, pictiúir agus an físeán a dhéantar a ghabháil i gcluichí agus feidhmchláir.
Gníomhaíocht shóisialta, lena n-áirítear sonraí comhrá agus idirghníomhaíochtaí le cluichirí eile, agus na naisc (cairde a chuirtear leis agus daoine a leanann tú) a dhéanann tú ar líonra Xbox.
Má úsáideann tú consól nó feidhmchlár Xbox ar ghléas eile ar féidir leis líonra Xbox a rochtain, agus má chuimsíonn an gléas sin gléas stórála (tiomántán crua nó aonad cuimhne), stórálfar sonraí úsáide ar an ngléas stórála lena seoladh chuig Microsoft an chéad uair eile a shíníonn tú isteach ar Xbox, fiú má bhíonn tú ag imirt as líne.
Cuidíonn na sonraí a bhailímid dúinn eispéiris coimeádta a chur ar fáil duit. Áirítear orthu sin thú a cheangal le cluichí, inneachar agus seirbhísí, chomh maith le tairiscintí, lascainí agus moltaí a thabhairt duit. Chun do shocruithe a athrú le haghaidh na moltaí seo, tabhair cuairt ar
leathanach sábháilteachta agus príobháideachais Xbox ar líne
.
Ceamara agus Micreafón
. Agus iad i mbun Xbox á úsáid, is féidir le himreoirí cumais an ghléis, amhail an micreafón, an ceamara, agus taifeadadh scáileán a úsáid lena n-eispéireas cluichíochta a fheabhsú. Nuair a imrítear cluiche Xbox sa Windows Game Bar, d’fhéadfaí go mbainfí úsáid as an gceamara agus an micreafón, lena n-áirítear chun grianghraif agus físeáin a léamh agus chun seatanna scáileáin a ghlacadh agus a thaifeadadh.
Sonraí diagnóiseacha Xbox
. Tá dhá chatagóir i gceist le sonraí diagnóiseacha: riachtanach agus roghnach.
Riachtanach
. Cuirfidh Xbox na sonraí riachtanacha chuig Microsoft. An líon is lú sonraí a bhfuil gá leo chun Xbox a choinneáil slán úr, agus é ag feidhmiú mar a bheifí ag súil leis.
Roghnach
. Is sonraí roghnacha ann ná sonraí breise a ndéanann tú cinneadh iad a chomhroinnt le Microsoft. B’fhéidir go mbeidh sonraí eile maidir le feidhmíocht agus úsáid thairgí agus seirbhísí Xbox chomh maith le tuairisciú earráid san áireamh le sonraí roghnach.

Gabhálacha cluiche
. Is féidir le haon imreoir a bhfuil páirt á glacadh aige i seisiún cluiche il-imreoirí físeán a thaifeadadh (gearrthóga cluiche) agus gabhálacha scáileáin a dhéanamh den amharc cluiche atá aige. Is féidir do charachtar cluiche agus leasainm cluichire a ghabháil i ngearrthóga cluiche agus gabhálacha scáileáin na n-imreoirí eile le linn an tseisiúin sin. Má dhéanann imreoir gearrthóga agus gabhálacha scáileáin den chluiche ar ríomhaire, seans go ndéanfar an comhrá fuaime a ghabháil freisin sna gearrthóga cluiche.
Fotheidealú
. I gcomhrá fíor-ama (“cóisir”) Xbox, is féidir le himreoirí gné gutha go téacs a ghníomhachtú, a cheadaíonn dóibh amharc ar an gcomhrá sin mar théacs. Má ghníomhachtaíonn imreoir an ghné seo, cuirtear fotheideal ar gach cumarsáid gutha sa chóisir don imreoir. Úsáideann Microsoft na sonraí téacs sin chun fotheidealú comhrá a sholáthar do na himreoirí a dteastaíonn sé uathu agus le haghaidh na gcuspóirí eile a ndéantar cur síos orthu sa ráiteas seo.
Sonraí Xbox ar féidir le daoine eile amharc orthu
. Is féidir leo siúd a leanas breathnú ar do leasainm cluichire, staidreamh cluichí agus imeartha, éachtaí, láithreacht (cibé an bhfuil nó nach bhfuil tú sínithe isteach ar Xbox faoi láthair), inneachar a chomhroinneann tú agus sonraí eile maidir le do ghníomhaíocht ar Xbox:
Imreoirí eile atá sínithe isteach ar Xbox.
Custaiméirí de chuid seirbhísí tríú páirtí lena bhfuil do phróifíl nasctha, nó
Seirbhísí eile a bhaineann le Xbox (seirbhísí cuideachtaí comhpháirtíochta san áireamh).
Mar shampla, is faisnéis phoiblí do leasainm cluichire agus do scóir ar chlár ceann riain an chluiche agus ní féidir iad a chur i bhfolach. Le haghaidh sonraí eile, is féidir leat do shocruithe príobháideachais a choigeartú ar an gconsól agus ag

Sonraí Xbox a chomhroinntear le tríú páirtithe lena n-áirítear foilsitheoirí cluiche agus feidhmchláir
. Nuair a úsáideann tú cluiche ar líne Xbox nó feidhmchlár atá ceangailte leis an líonra ar do chonsól Xbox, ríomhaire nó gléas móibíleach, bíonn rochtain ag foilsitheoir an chluiche nó an fheidhmchláir sin ar shonraí faoin úsáid a bhaineann tú as chun cabhrú leis a tháirge a sholáthar agus a fheabhsú agus tacaíocht a chur ar fáil ina leith. D’fhéadfadh an méid seo a leanas bheith san áireamh sna sonraí sin: d’aitheantóir úsáideora Xbox agus do leasainm cluichire, faisnéis theoranta cuntais amhail tír agus raon aoise, sonraí faoi do chumarsáid i gcluichí, gníomhaíocht fhorfheidhmithe Xbox, seisiúin imeartha (mar shampla, rudaí a rinneadh sa chluiche, na cineálacha feithiclí a úsáideadh sa chluiche), do láithreacht ar líonra Xbox, an méid ama a chaitheann tú ag imirt an chluiche nó an fheidhmchláir, rangaithe, staidreamh, próifílí cluichirí, abhatáranna nó pictiúir de chluichirí, liostaí cairde, fothaí gníomhaíochta na gclubanna oifigiúla ina bhfuil tú páirteach, ballraíocht i gclubanna oifigiúla, agus aon inneachar eile a chruthaíonn nó a chuireann tú isteach sa chluiche nó san fheidhmchláir.
Bíonn a gcaidreamh uathúil neamhspleách féin le húsáideoirí ag foilsitheoirí agus forbróirí tríú páirtí na gcluichí agus na bhfeidhmchlár, agus déanann siad sonraí pearsanta a bhailiú agus a úsáid i gcomhréir lena bpolasaithe príobháideachais ar leith. Ba chóir duit athbhreithniú cúramach a dhéanamh ar a bpolasaithe chun an dóigh a n-úsáideann siad na sonraí a fháil amach. Mar shampla, d’fhéadfadh foilsitheoirí a roghnú sonraí cluiche a nochtadh nó a thaispeáint (amhail ar chláir ceann riain) trína seirbhísí féin. D’fhéadfadh nasc lena bpolasaithe a bheith le fáil ar leathanaigh mionsonraí cluiche nó feidhmchláir i Microsoft Store.

Sábháilteacht
. D'fhonn cabhrú le timpeallacht shábháilte cluichíocht a dhéanamh den líonra Xbox agus Caighdeáin an Phobail do Xbox a fhorfheidhmiú, féadfaimid guth, téacs, íomhánna, físeáin agus inneachar sa chluiche a bhailiú agus a athbhreithniú (ar nós gearrthóga cluiche a uaslódálann tú, comhráite atá agat agus rudaí atá post agat i gcluichí agus cluichí).
Frithchalaois agus cosc caimiléireachta
. Tá sé tábhachtach dúinn timpeallacht chothrom imeartha a sholáthar. Coisctear calaois, haiceáil, goid cuntas agus aon ghníomhaíocht neamhúdaraithe nó chalaoiseach eile nuair a úsáideann tú cluiche Xbox ar líne nó aon fheidhmchlár nasctha leis an líonra ar do chonsól Xbox, ríomhaire nó gléas móibíleach. D'fhonn calaois agus caimiléireacht a bhrath agus a chosc, féadfaimid úsáid a bhaint as uirlisí frith-aicearra agus cosc caimiléireachta, feidhmchláir agus teicneolaíochtaí eile. Féadfaidh teicneolaíochtaí den sórt sin sínithe digiteacha a chruthú (ar a dtugtar “hais”) ag baint úsáide as faisnéis áirithe a bhailítear ó do chonsól Xbox, ríomhaire nó gléas móibíleach agus conas a úsáideann tú an gléas sin. D’fhéadfadh faisnéis faoin mbrabhsálaí, gléas, gníomhaíochtaí, aitheantóirí cluiche agus córais oibriúcháin a bheith san áireamh anseo.

Kinect
. Tá comhcheangal ceamara, micreafóin agus braiteora infridheirg sa bhraiteoir Kinect, agus d’fhéadfaí leis guth agus gluaiseachtaí a chumasú chun an imirt a rialú. Mar shampla:
Más mian leat, is féidir an ceamara a úsáid chun síniú isteach sa líonra Xbox go huathoibríoch le haithint aghaidhe. Fanann na sonraí sin ar an gconsól agus ní chomhroinntear iad le duine ar bith. Is féidir leat na sonraí sin a scriosadh ó do chonsól uair ar bith.
Le haghaidh cluichíochta, mapálfaidh Kinect an fad idir ailt an choirp chun duine cipíneach díot a chruthú a chabhraíonn le Kinect cluichíocht a chumasú.
Cumasaíonn micreafóin Kinect comhrá gutha idir imreoirí le linn cluichíochta. Cumasaíonn an micreafóin fosta orduithe gutha chun consól, cluiche, nó feidhmchláir a rialú, nó chun téarmaí cuardaigh a iontráil.
Is féidir braiteoir Kinect a úsáid, leis, le haghaidh cumarsáid fuaime agus físeáin trí sheirbhísí ar nós Skype.

Microsoft Store
Seirbhís ar líne is ea Microsoft Store, atá inrochtana trí ríomhaire, trí chonsól an Xbox agus an Xbox App, trínar féidir leat dul ag brabhsáil, feidhmchláir agus inneachar digiteach eile a íoslódáil, a cheannach, a rátáil, agus a athbhreithniú. Cuimsíonn sé:
Feidhmchlár agus inneachar do ghléasanna Windows ar nós fóin phóca, ríomhairí, agus táibléid.
Cluichí, síntiúis agus feidhmchláir eile le haghaidh consóil Xbox agus gléasanna eile.
Táirgí agus aipeanna le haghaidh Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access, agus Project (leaganacha 2013 nó níos déanaí).
Bailímid sonraí maidir leis an gcaoi a ndéanann tú Microsoft Store a rochtain agus a úsáid; na táirgí a d'amharc tú orthu, a cheannaigh, nó a shuiteáil tú; na roghanna a shocraigh tú maidir le hamharc ar fheidhmchláir i Microsoft Store; agus aon rátálacha, athbhreithniú, nó tuairiscí faidhbe a chuireann tú isteach. Baineann do chuntas Microsoft le rátálacha agus léirmheasanna uait; agus má scríobhann tú léirmheas, foilseofar an t-ainm agus an pictiúr ón gcuntas Microsoft in éineacht leis an léirmheas. Baineann Microsoft Store úsáid as an réigiún arna choigeartú ar do ghléas chun ábhar ábhartha agus incháilithe agus marsantú a thaispeáint. Baineann Microsoft Store úsáid as d’aitheantóir gléis chun na cearta táirge a mbaineann le gléas ar leith a bhainistiú.
Cead d'fheidhmchláir Microsoft Store
. Dearadh cuid mhaith de na feidhmchláir a shuiteálann tú ó Microsoft Store chun tairbhe a bhaint as gnéithe bogearraí agus crua-earraí faoi leith ar do ghléas. D'fhéadfadh an úsáid a bhaineann feidhmchlár éigin as gnéithe crua-earra nó bogearraí faoi leith rochtain ar do shonraí a thabhairt don fheidhmchláir sin nó do sheirbhís atá gaolmhar leis. Mar shampla, d'fhéadfadh feidhmchlár eagarthóireachta grianghraif ceamara do ghléis a oscailt chun ligean duit grianghraf nua a ghlacadh nó grianghraif nó físeáin atá stóráilte ar do ghléas a oscailt lena gcur in eagar, agus d'fhéadfadh treoir bialann do shuíomh a úsáid chun moltaí a dhéanamh maidir le bialanna in aice láimhe. Gheofar faisnéis maidir leis na gnéithe a úsáideann feidhmchlár ar leathanach tuairiscithe táirge an fheidhmchláir i Microsoft Store. Is iomaí gné d'fheidhmchláir Microsoft Store is féidir a chasadh as nó air trí shocruithe príobháideachta do ghléis. In Windows, is minic is féidir leat na feidhmchláir a úsáideann gné ar leith a roghnú. Go to
Tosaigh > Socruithe > Príobháideachas nó Príobháideachas & Slándáil
, roghnaigh an ghné (Féilire, mar shampla), ansin roghnaigh cad iad na ceadanna feidhmchláir a chasfaidh tú air nó as. Ní bheidh feidhmchláir "Clasaiceacha Windows" ar liostaí na bhfeidhmchlár i socruithe príobháideachais Windows ar féidir leo gnéithe crua-earraí agus bogearraí a úsáid, agus ní bheidh aon tionchar ag na socruithe sin ar na feidhmchláir seo.
Nuashonruithe feidhmchláir
. Mura bhfuil na nuashonruithe uathoibríocha feidhmchláir díchumasaithe agat sna socruithe ábhartha Microsoft Store, seiceálfaidh Microsoft Store go huathoibríoch an bhfuil nuashonruithe feidhmchláir ann lena chinntiú go bhfuil an leagan is déanaí agat, agus déanfar iad a íoslódáil agus a shuiteáil. D'fhéadfadh feidhmchláir nuashonraithe gnéithe difriúla de chrua-earraí agus de bhogearraí Windows a úsáid, i gcomparáid le leaganacha roimhe seo, a d'fhéadhfadh rochtain a thabhairt dóibh ar shonraí difriúla ar do ghléas. Iarrfar do thoiliú ort má osclaíonn feidhmchlár nuashonraithe gnéithe áirithe, ar nós suímh. Agus is féidir leat athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar na gnéithe crua-earraí agus bogearraí a úsáideann feidhmchláir ach amharc ar an leathanach leis an gcur síos ar an táirge i Microsoft Store.
Maidir leis an úsáid a bhaineann gach feidhmchlár as aon sonraí a bhailítear trí na gnéithe seo, is faoi réir polasaí príobháideachta fhorbóir an fheidhmchláir atá sí. Má dhéanann feidhmchlár atá ar fáil trí Microsoft Store aon sonraí pearsanta a bhailiú nó a úsáid, ní mór d'fhorbróir an fheidhmchláir polasaí príobháideachais a sholáthar, agus gheofar nasc chuig an polasaí príobháideachais ar leathanach tuairiscithe táirge an fheidhmchláir i Microsoft Store.
Feidhmchláir taobhlódáilte agus mód forbróra
. Cuirtear gnéithe forbróra ar nós an tsocraithe "mód forbróra" ar fáil d'fhorbróirí amháin. Má chumasaíonn tú gnéithe forbróra, is féidir go dtiocfaidh do ghléas chun a bheith neamhiontaofa nó neamh-in-úsáidte, agus tú a chur faoi bhagairt slándála. Nuair a íoslódálann tú nó nuair a fhaigheann feidhmchláir ó fhoinsí taobh amuigh de Microsoft Store, a dtugtar feidhmchlár"taobhlódáil" air, freisin, is féidir go mbeidh do ghléas agus do shonraí pearsanta níos leochailí i gcás ionsaí nó úsáid gan choinne a bhainfeadh feidhmchláir astu. Is féidir nach n-oibreodh beartas, fógraí, ceadanna, agus gnéithe eile de Windows mar atá ceaptha mar chabhair chun do phríobháideacht a chosaint nuair a osclaíonn feidhmchláir do shonraí mar atá tuairiscithe sa ráiteas seo i gcás feidhmchlár taobhlódáilte nó nuair a chumasaítear gnéithe forbróra.

Silverlight
Cabhraíonn Microsoft Silverlight leat inneachar saibhir ar an ngréasán a oscailt agus taitneamh a bhaint as. Cumasaíonn Silverlight do shuíomhanna agus do sheirbhísí sonraí a stóráil ar do ghléas. Baineann gnéithe eile de Silverlight le ceangal le Microsoft chun nuashonruithe a fháil, nó le freastalaithe de chuid Microsoft agus de chuid tríú páirtithe chun inneachar digiteach faoi chosaint a sheinm.
Uirlis Chumraíochta Silverlight
. Is féidir leat roghanna a dhéanamh faoi na gnéithe sin san Uirlis Cumhraíocht Silverlight. Chun uirlis Cumraíochta Silverlight a oscailt, deaschliceáil ar inneachar atá á thaispeáint ag Silverlight faoi láthair agus roghnaigh
Silverlight
. Is féidir freisin uirlis Chumraíochta Silverlight a rith go díreach. In Windows, mar shampla, is féidir an uirlis a rochtain trí "Microsoft Silverlight" a chuardach.
Stóras feidhmchláir Silverlight
. Tá na feidhme bunaithe ar Silverlight in ann comhaid sonraithe a chur i dtáisce go háitiúil i do ríomhaire le cuspóirí éagsúla, mar shampla do shocruithe a shábháil, comhaid móra a chur i dtáisce do gnéithe grafacha (ar nós cluichí, léarscáileanna agus íomhánna), agus inneachar atá cruthaithe agat le feidhmeanna faoi leith a chur i dtáisce. Is féidir an stóráil feidhme a dhíchumasú nó a shocrú leis an uirlis Cumhraíochta Silverlight.
Nuashonruithe Silverlight
. Beidh Silverlight ag seiceáil freastalaithe Microsoft go téarmach le nuashonraithe a fháil amach, agus na gnéithe is déanaí a chur ar fáil duit. Beidh comhad bheag le heolas faoin leagan Silverlight is déanaí á íoslódáil ar do ríomhaire agus á chur i gcomparáid leis an leagan atá agat. Má tá leagan nua ar fáil, beidh sé íoslódáilte agus suiteáilte ar do ríomhaire. Is féidir na nuashonraithe a dhíchumasú nó a shocrú leis an uirlis Cumhraíochta Silverlight.
Bainistíocht Cearta Digiteacha
. Baineann Silverlight úsáid as Bainistíocht Cirta Digiteacha Microsoft (DRM) chun na cearta atá ag úinéirí inneachair a chosaint. Má tá rochtain agat ar inneachar cosanta ag DRM (ar nós ceol nó fís) le Silverlight, beidh cearta úsáid mhéide uait ó freastalaí cirta san Idirlíon. Chun taithí athsheinm foirfe a sholáthair duit, ní bheidh rochtain le feiceáil sula sheolann Silverlight an t-iarratas chuig an freastalaí cirta. Agus cearta úsáide meán á n-iarraidh agat, soláthróidh Silverlight ID don bhfreastalaí ceart ID le haghaidh an chomhaid inneachais faoi chosaint DRM agus bunsonraí maidir le do ghléas, lena n-áirítear sonraí maidir leis na comhpháirteanna DRM ar do ghléas ar nós a leibhéil athcheartaithe agus slándála, agus aitheantóir uathúil do ghléis.
Nuashonraithe DRM
. I gcásanna áirithe, beidh nuashonra ar Silverlight nó ar DRM uait chun rochtain a fháil ar inneachar cosanta ag DRM i do ghléas. Má dhéanann tú iarracht inneachar ar gá nuashonrú DRM dó a sheinm, seolfaidh Silverlight iarratas chuig freastalaí Microsoft ina gcuimseofar bunsonraí maidir le do ghléas, lena n-áirítear faisnéis maidir leis na comhpháirteanna DRM ar do ríomhaire, dála a leibhéil athcheartaithe agus slándála, sonraí fabhtcheartaithe, agus aitheantóir uathúil maidir le do ghléas. Úsáideann freastalaí Microsoft an t-aitheantóir seo chun nuashonrú uathúil DRM a chur ar fáil do do ghléas, a shuiteálfaidh Silverlight ina dhiaidh sin. Is féidir nuashonraithe chomhpháirt DRM a chasadh as nó a chumrú ar tháb

Summary of Key Terms:
• Crash logs and statistical information related to your use of each Beta App will automatically be provided to Apple and the Application Provider as part of TestFlight.
• You may submit suggestions and ideas to the Application Provider of the Beta App.
• Beta Apps may crash and result in data loss in those Beta Apps.
• If you already have the full version of an app, installation of a Beta App may result in data loss.
• You can stop participating in a beta test for a Beta App by deleting the Beta App from your device.
-----
Your use of the TestFlight service (“TestFlight”), including any beta testing of any pre-release applications for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or other Apple-branded hardware downloaded through TestFlight (“Beta Apps”), is governed by the following terms and conditions (“TestFlight Terms of Service”). Except as specifically amended below, full Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions for your region apply and are hereby incorporated by reference, and defined terms shall have the meanings set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, except as noted herein. For the purpose of these TestFlight Terms of Service, the term “Licensed Application” shall include Beta Apps. See Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
Specific Terms for Beta-Testers
Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to use TestFlight. If you are 13 or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction or older, but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to the following terms.
TestFlight is designed to help third-party developers (“Application Providers”) beta-test and improve the performance of their pre-release applications for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or other Apple-branded hardware and to provide beta-testers with Beta Apps. If an Application Provider authorizes you as a beta-tester and you choose to download the corresponding Beta App from the Application Provider via TestFlight, then conditioned on your compliance with these TestFlight Terms of Service, the Application Provider grants you a limited, non- exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to access, download and use the Beta App for which you have been selected as a beta-tester and any related documentation available online, solely for beta- testing purposes for a limited time and subject to these TestFlight Terms of Service.
As between you and the Application Provider, and aside from the limited license set forth above, the Application Provider owns all right, title and interest in the Beta App, including but not limited to intellectual property rights. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you may not: (a) modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any Beta App; (b) rent, lease, loan, sell, sublicense, distribute, transmit, or otherwise transfer any Beta App; (c) make any copy of or otherwise reproduce any Beta App; or (d) display any Beta App to unauthorized third parties without the Application Providerʼs authorization.
You agree to use reasonable efforts to beta-test any Beta App.
You acknowledge that you understand that Beta Apps are pre-release, alpha, or beta software and may be incomplete or could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should not use Beta Apps in a commercial operating environment or with important data. You should back up any data prior to using any Beta App on your Apple-branded device. Neither Apple nor the Application Provider shall be responsible for any costs, expenses or other liabilities you may incur as a result of using any Beta Apps, including but not limited to any damage, loss, or corruption of any software, information or data. Further, Beta Apps may not be compatible with production Apps. If you have a production version of a Beta App already installed on your Apple-branded device, you should back-up any data associated with such app prior to installing a beta version since data may be corrupted or lost between different versions of the same app. You expressly acknowledge and agree that any use of Beta Apps is done entirely at your own risk.
In addition, if you have the full version of an app installed on your device and you install the same Beta App, your app data may be corrupted or lost and may not be recoverable. You should back up your information before installing a Beta App. Solely for the purposes of testing a Beta App and only for the duration of such test, any in-app purchases made within the Beta App will be made available to you at no cost and such purchases will not be charged to your Account. If you purchase or download the App from the App Store, your data may not remain available from within the full version. We recommend that you back up your data before deleting the Beta App or purchasing the full version from the App Store.
Beta Apps provided by Apple and/or third-party developers may not be available in all languages or in all countries, and Apple makes no representation that the Beta Apps are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access and use the Beta Apps through TestFlight, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Beta Apps are time-limited and TestFlight may change, limit, or cease providing access to Beta Apps any time without notice or liability to you. You further understand and agree that certain information about a Beta App downloaded via TestFlight may not be available to you prior to download, including without limitation the Beta App's age rating, minimum hardware requirements, and the availability of items available for purchase within the Beta App (i.e. in-app purchases). By downloading a Beta App, you consent to using the Beta App without such information and disclosures.
You acknowledge and agree that you will not be compensated for evaluating any Beta App or for any Beta Input, and you will bear all of your own costs from using TestFlight and any Beta Apps (e.g., mobile carrier and data costs). Further, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the content contained in, and your use of, any Beta App that is not already publicly available shall be considered confidential unless the Application Provider explicitly authorizes public disclosure. You agree to hold the Beta App in confidence and to treat it as confidential, e.g., not share it with others who do not have the Beta App installed.
If you have a complaint about a Beta App, you should send it directly to the Application Provider. You acknowledge and agree that the Application Provider, not Apple, is fully responsible for any Beta App, unless Apple is the licensor of such Beta App.
Beta Testing Data and Beta Feedback
When you use a Beta App through TestFlight, Apple and the Application Provider will automatically collect crash logs and usage data (“Beta Testing Data”) and you may not opt-out of the collection of Beta Testing Data.
TestFlight will also provide you with the ability to submit written or visual feedback (e.g., screenshots and comments) about the Beta Apps to Apple and/or Application Providers (“Beta Feedback”). If you submit Beta Feedback, you acknowledge and agree that you do so at your own initiative and that the Application Provider (including Apple, if it is Appleʼs Beta App) will have the right to use your Beta Feedback as set forth below. You represent to the Application Provider that you have all the necessary rights to give the Beta Feedback and to grant the rights to the Application Provider.
The Application Provider may use the Beta Testing Data and Beta Feedback to improve their App and related products, and may contact you regarding your use of their Beta App. The Application Providerʼs use of Beta Testing Data and Beta Feedback is subject to limitations and requirements set forth by Apple in the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and to the Application Providerʼs Privacy Policy. Apple may use the Beta Testing Data to improve its products and services.
Beta Testing Data and Beta Feedback may include personally identifying information, including in the screenshots you provide, such as when a screenshot includes your photos or image and likeness, and information about your device, including but not limited to various unique device identifiers, hardware and operating system specifications, performance statistics, and data about how you use your device, system and application software, networking information, and peripherals. When you use TestFlight and the Beta App, details will be provided regarding what data is sent to Apple and the Application Provider, and how the information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://testflight.apple.com/#privacy-data . At all times, Apple will handle your information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/.
Apple is committed to diversity and to providing a safe, harassment-free experience for everyone. Beta Feedback should be respectful and should not include offensive, malicious, or derogatory writing, images, or screenshots.
NO WARRANTY
YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF TESTFLIGHT AND ANY BETA APP ACQUIRED VIA TESTFLIGHT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. BETA APPS MAY HAVE SOFTWARE, SERVICE, AND OTHER ERRORS AND YOUR USE OF TESTFLIGHT AND/OR BETA APPS DOWNLOADED VIA TESTFLIGHT MAY NOT BE CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE AND MAY NOT STORE DATA ACCURATELY OR AT ALL. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF TESTFLIGHT AND BETA APPS DOWNLOADED VIA TESTFLIGHT ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND MAY CEASE TO BE AVAILABLE TO YOU AT ANY TIME WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TESTFLIGHT, BETA APPS ACQUIRED VIA TESTFLIGHT, AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY TESTFLIGHT AND/OR SUCH BETA APPS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLE AND THE APPLICATION PROVIDER HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO TESTFLIGHT, THE BETA APPS, AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND THE APPLICATION PROVIDER DO NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF TESTFLIGHT AND/OR THE BETA APP, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN OR SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY TESTFLIGHT AND/OR THE BETA APP WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE BETA APP OR TESTFLIGHT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE BETA APP OR TESTFLIGHT WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLICATION PROVIDER OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE BETA APP OR TESTFLIGHT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Termination
To terminate your participation in beta-testing a particular Beta App, delete the Beta App from your device. Deleting the Beta App from your device will also delete any data you have generated within that Beta App, and may delete any data created in a previously installed full version of the App. Deleting the Beta App will not delete Beta Testing Data or Beta Input that you, TestFlight, or the Beta App have already provided to the Application Provider and Apple. To request deletion of your personal information, contact the Application Provider or Apple directly. Apple and/or the Application Provider reserve the right to terminate your participation in the beta testing of any Beta App at any time, in their sole discretion. By way of example, this termination may occur if you provide Beta Feedback that contains offensive and inappropriate images to the Application Provider.

At AWS, customer trust is our top priority.
Maintaining customer trust is an ongoing commitment. AWS continually monitors the evolving privacy regulatory and legislative landscape to identify changes and determine what tools our customers might need to meet their compliance goals. We strive to inform you of the privacy and data security policies, practices, and technologies we’ve put in place.
Our commitments include:
Access:
As a customer, you maintain full control of your content that you upload to the AWS services under your AWS account, and responsibility for configuring access to AWS services and resources. We provide an advanced set of access, encryption, and logging features to help you do this effectively (e.g.,
AWS Identity and Access Management
,
AWS Organizations
and
AWS CloudTrail
). We also provide APIs for you to configure access control permissions for any of the services you develop or deploy in an AWS environment. We do not access or use your content for any purpose without your agreement. We do not use your content or derive information from it for marketing or advertising purposes.
Storage:
You choose the AWS Region(s) in which your content is stored. You can replicate and back up your content in more than one AWS Region. We will not move or replicate your content outside of your chosen AWS Region(s) without your agreement.
Security:
You choose how your content is secured. We offer you industry-leading encryption features to protect your content in transit and at rest, and we provide you with the option to manage your own encryption keys. These data protection features include:
Data encryption capabilities available in over 100 AWS services
.
Flexible key management options using AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
, allowing customers to choose whether to have AWS manage their encryption keys or keep complete control over their keys.
Security assurance program, using best practices for security and data protection to help you operate securely within AWS, and to make the best use of our security control environment. These security protections and control processes are independently validated by
multiple third-party independent assessments
.
Disclosure of customer content
: We will not disclose customer content (see How does AWS classify customer information? below) unless we're required to do so to comply with the law or a valid and binding order of a government body. If a governmental body sends AWS a demand for your customer content, we will attempt to redirect the governmental body to request that data directly from you. If compelled to disclose your customer content to a government body, we will give you reasonable notice of the demand to allow you to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless AWS is legally prohibited from doing so.
FAQs
What is customer content?
We define customer content as software (including machine images), data, text, audio, video, or images that a customer or any end user transfers to us for processing, storage, or hosting by AWS services in connection with a customer's account, and any computational results that a customer or their end user derives from the foregoing through their use of AWS services. For example, customer content includes content that a customer or their end user stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Customer content does not include account information, which we describe below. Customer content also does not include information included in resource identifiers, metadata tags, access controls, rules, usage policies, permissions, and similar items related to the management of AWS resources. AWS recommends that you do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in these items. The terms of the
AWS Customer Agreement
and the
AWS Service Terms
apply to your customer content.
What is account information?
We define account information as information about a customer that a customer provides to us in connection with the creation or administration of a customer account. For example, account information includes names, usernames, phone numbers, email addresses, and billing information associated with a customer account. The information practices described in the
AWS Privacy Notice
apply to account information.
Who owns customer content?
As a customer, you own your customer content, and you select which AWS services can process, store, and host your customer content. We do not access or use your customer content for any purpose without your agreement. We do not use customer content or derive information from it for marketing or advertising.
Who controls customer content?
As a customer, you control your content:
You determine the geographic region where your customer content will be stored and the type of storage.
You choose the secured state of your customer content. We offer you industry-leading encryption features to protect your content in transit and at rest, and we provide you with the option to manage your own encryption keys.
You manage access to your customer content, and access to AWS services and resources through users, groups, permissions, and credentials that you control.
How do you use my account information?
The
AWS Privacy Notice
describes how we collect and use account information.
How does AWS use information included in resource identifiers and other items related to the management of AWS resources?
AWS uses that information to provide the AWS services, and to protect and improve the customer experience. For example, AWS uses resource identifiers to help customers generate cost and usage reports, which can be used to break down AWS spend by cost center, and IAM permissions to determine whether a specific user can purchase reserved instances. When customers contact AWS for technical assistance, AWS may also analyze resource identifiers and permissions to help resolve their issues.
What happens when AWS receives a legal request for customer content?
We are vigilant about our customers' privacy. We will not disclose customer content unless we're required to do so to comply with the law or a valid and binding order of a governmental body. If a governmental body sends AWS a demand for customer content, we will attempt to redirect the governmental body to request that data directly from the customer. Governmental and regulatory bodies need to follow the applicable legal process to obtain valid and binding orders. We review all orders and object to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate ones. If compelled to disclose customer content to a government body, we will give customers reasonable notice of the demand to allow the customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless AWS is legally prohibited from doing so. It is also important to point out that our customers can encrypt their customer content, and we provide customers with the option to manage their own encryption keys.
We know that transparency matters to our customers, so we regularly publish a report about the types and volume of information requests we receive on the
Amazon Information Requests
webpage.
Where is customer content stored?
The
AWS Global Infrastructure
gives you the flexibility to choose where and how you want to run your workloads using the same network, control plane, APIs, and AWS services. If you would like to run your applications globally you can choose from any of the AWS Regions and Availability Zones. As a customer, you choose the AWS Region(s) in which your customer content is stored, allowing you to deploy AWS services in the location(s) of your choice, in accordance with your specific geographic requirements. For example, if an AWS customer in Australia wants to store their data only in Australia, they can choose to deploy their AWS services exclusively in the Asia Pacific (Sydney) AWS Region. If you want to discover other flexible storage options see the
AWS Regions
webpage.
You can also replicate and back up your customer content in more than one AWS Region. We will not move or replicate your content outside of your chosen AWS Region(s), except as necessary to provide the services you initiated, or as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. However, it is important to note that some AWS services may not be available in all AWS Regions. For more information about which services are available in which AWS Regions, see the
AWS Regional Services
webpage.
What is my role in securing my content?
When evaluating the security of a cloud solution, it is important for you to understand and distinguish between the security of the cloud, and your security in the cloud. Security of the cloud encompasses the security measures that AWS implements and operates. We are responsible for security of the cloud. Security in the cloud encompasses the security measures that you implement and operate, related to the AWS services you use. You are responsible for your security in the cloud. For more information, see the
AWS Shared Responsibility
webpage.
What step does AWS take to protect my privacy?
At AWS, our highest priority is securing our customers’ data, and we implement rigorous contractual, technical, and organizational measures to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability regardless of which AWS Region a customer has selected.
AWS complies with ISO 27018, a code of practice that focuses on protection of personal data in the cloud. It extends ISO information security standard 27001 to cover the regulatory requirements for the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) or personal data for the public cloud computing environment and specifies implementation guidance based on ISO 27002 controls that is applicable to PII processed by public cloud service providers. For more information, or to view the AWS ISO 27018 Certification, see the
AWS ISO 27018 Compliance
webpage.
Additionally, AWS publishes a SOC 2 Type II Privacy report, based on the SOC 2 Privacy Trust Criteria developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), which establishes criteria for evaluating controls related to how personal data is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed to meet the entity’s objectives. The AWS SOC 2 Type II Privacy report provides third-party attestation of our systems and the suitability of the design of our privacy controls. The scope of the privacy report includes information about how we handle the content that you upload to AWS and how it is protected in all of the services and locations that are in scope for the latest
AWS SOC reports
. The SOC 2 Type II Privacy report can be downloaded through
AWS Artifact
in the
AWS Management Console
.
Who should I contact if I have questions regarding AWS and data protection?
We recommend that customers with questions regarding AWS and data protection contact their AWS account manager. If customers have signed up for Enterprise Support, they can also reach out to their Technical Account Manager (TAM) for support. AWS account managers and TAMs work with Solutions Architects to help customers meet their compliance needs. AWS can’t provide legal advice to customers, and we recommend that customers consult their legal counsel if they have legal questions regarding data protection.
We also have teams of Enterprise Support Representatives, Professional Services Consultants, and other staff to help with privacy questions. You can contact us with questions
here
