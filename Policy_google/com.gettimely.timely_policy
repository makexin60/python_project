The email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
4. How do we protect your information?
Timely has implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our thirty party vendor’s servers which utilise industry standard security controls. The Timely Sites utilise secure SSL for all form data submissions in conjunction with a 256-bit certificate. Timely does not directly store, process, or transmit bank account and credit card information. All payment processing, and collection of payment account data, is accomplished via integration with third-party service providers.
These providers are contractually required to maintain compliance with the PCI DSS – Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and with all rules for electronic funds transfers. This includes secure transmission of credit card/bank account information, and encrypted storage of all payment account information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted via our Sites or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk.
We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites or the Services. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Additionally, do not leave your device unlocked so that other individuals may access your device or account. Timely is not in control of your wireless connection or the devices you use to log into the Services, so you should make sure you trust the devices and connections you use to access the Services. If you believe that you have experienced unauthorised access or use of your account, please contact us immediately at
privacy@gettimely.com
.
5. Do we use cookies?
Certain portions of our Services may collect information via cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar digital tracking technologies. These technologies can be used to operate, secure and provide our Services by collecting and analysing information related to your use of the Services. Generally, this information is collected when you request pages from our Services, and typically includes information such as the page served, the time, the source and type of browser making the request, the most recent page view, what you clicked on to arrive at our Services, the content you viewed on our Services, and other similar information relating to your use of our Services. In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.
Other than Cookies, Timely utilises only strictly necessary and functional Cookies as part of its mobile and web-based applications.
6. Email communications
Timely sends billing information, product information, service updates and service notifications to you via email. Our emails contain clear and obvious instructions describing how you can unsubscribe from any mailing list not essential to the Service. Timely will also remove you at your request via reaching out to the Timely Support team.
7. Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
Personal Data we collect may be shared with a variety of parties depending upon the purpose for and context in which that information was provided.
We will share your Personal Data in accordance with your consent for us to do so. By utilising any Timely Services, Clients consent to their Personal Data being shared with both Timely and the Timely User with which they are doing business.
Timely works with a number of third parties and partners who help us provide the Timely Services to our Users. Examples include hosting services, accounting services, business intelligence platforms, email and SMS partners, customer relationship management services, customer support platforms and more. In order to supply the Timely service Timely may send them Personal Data for storage or processing. In all cases where we share Personal Data with third parties, we will use a “minimum necessary” standard to disclose only that information required for satisfying the purpose of or performing the service for which the information is disclosed. Timely has taken steps to ensure that each partner or third party involved treats the Personal Data in accordance with all privacy laws and regulations applicable to our Users.
In order to streamline certain business operations and improve the user experience, develop products and services that better meet the interests and needs of our customers, and inform our customers about relevant products and services, we may share a User’s or Visitor’s Personal Data with any of our current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries and parent companies (“Affiliates”). Users and Visitors hereby agree to our sharing some or all of their information and Personal Data with our Affiliates. We never share Client Personal Data with Affiliates.
Your Personal Data may be processed in the event of a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. For example, Personal Data may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process for a potential transaction or may part of the assets transferred, in such case the acquiring company will possess any rights granted to us under this Policy.
In limited circumstances, we may, without notice to you or your consent, access and disclose your Personal Data, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, and to the extent we believe such disclosure is legally required. We may also disclose your Personal Data without notice or consent to prevent or respond to a crime, to investigate violations of our Terms of Service or in the vital interests of us or any person or entity. Note, these disclosures may be made to governments that do not ensure the same degree of protection of your Personal Data as your home jurisdiction. We may, in our sole discretion (but without any obligation), object to the disclosure of your Personal Data to such parties.
Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
8. How long do we store your information?
We retain Personal Data for so long as necessary to service the purpose(s) for which your Personal Data was processed and for a reasonable time thereafter, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements. While retention requirements can vary by jurisdiction, we generally apply the retention periods noted below:
Services Usage
: We will retain Personal Data for as long as a User remains an active user of our Services and for a reasonable time thereafter, to serve the purpose(s) for which the Personal Data was processed. We may store any information about your activity on our Services, including data created, posted or shared by you while using our free or paid Services for as long as we deem it necessary or until you provide specific instructions to delete it, which may be indefinitely, or where a valid business reason exists for such storage such as retaining a comprehensive transaction history, maintaining the integrity of our systems and logs or for the establishment or defense of legal claims, audit and crime prevention purposes.
Client Data
: We may store on behalf of Users, for as long as a valid business reason exists, which may be indefinitely, any Personal Information collected about a Client or other individual, whether entered directly into our systems by the Client or whether entered by an authorised User via the Services.
Note that Users control any consumer data we collect and process on their behalf, whether that Personal Data is entered by a consumer Client or whether it is entered by a User via the Services, and it is up to the User to determine how long they will store their Clients’ Personal Information in our systems.
Site Activity
: We may store any information about your activity on our Sites or any other data created, posted or shared by you on our Sites for as long as we deem it necessary or until you provide specific instructions to delete it, which may be indefinitely, or where a valid business reason exists for such storage such as maintaining the integrity of our systems and logs or for the establishment or defense of legal claims, audit and crime prevention purposes.
Marketing
: We store information used for marketing purposes indefinitely until you unsubscribe or provide specific instructions to delete it. When you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we add your contact information to our suppression list to ensure we respect your unsubscribe request.
Cookie Data
: We retain any information collected via cookies, clear gifs, flash cookies, webpage counters and other technical or analytics tools up to one year from the expiry of the cookie or date of collection. Cookies owned by third parties may have other retention periods.
9. Third party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. By opting to take up these third party products you agree to Timely providing your information to these third parties and you acknowledge that these third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
10. Access to your account
To resolve customer support issues and queries related to your account, as well as ensure you have an optimal user experience, you consent to us both accessing and administering your account when required and where a valid and legitimate business purpose exists. If you do not wish us to access your account, then you may notify us in writing, however please note, that taking this action may prevent Timely from providing efficient trouble shooting services to you.
11. Cross-border transfer
Timely operates in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and in the United States. We host data in the United States and in Australia. Thus by accessing our Services your Personal Data may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States and in Australia and maintained on computers or servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Some information may also be stored locally on devices you use to interact with our Services. By accessing our Services you understand and consent to the transfer of your information to the United States and Australia and to those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy. If you do not want your information transferred to or processed or maintained outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located, you should not use our Services.
Please note, Timely acts as a data processor on behalf of its Users and Users are responsible for obtaining your consent relating to the collection, use, transfer and other processing of your Personal Data. Users may provide additional notices to you providing additional limitations or permissions with respect to our processing of your Personal Data in order to comply with applicable law.
12. Your rights

16. Designated Countries Privacy Rights
This section only applies to users of our Service that are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and/or Switzerland (collectively, the “Designated Countries”) at the time of data collection. We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. When we rely on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this section to any individual that masks or otherwise hides their location information from us so as not to appear located in the Designated Countries.

Our Relationship to You
Timely is a data controller with regard to any personal information directly collected from Visitors and Users of its Sites and Services. A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions are our service providers and are “data processors.”
Timely acts as a service provider to Users and is a “data processor” with regard to any consumer Personal Information imported by Users into our systems via our Services—whether that consumer Personal Information is entered directly into our systems by the consumer as a Client, entered or imported by an authorised User, or imported by an authorised User third party integration. As a “data processor” Timely does not have any direct control over the purposes for which and the manner in which any Client or potential Client personal information is processed; instead processing of this Personal Information is governed by data processing agreements between Timely and our Users.

(or the “Right to be Forgotten”): Upon your request, we will erase any of your personal information in our files that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.
Right to Restriction
: You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where one of the following conditions applies:
You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. If you restrict processing based on this condition, you may experience an interruption of some or all of the Services during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information;
The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead;
We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of our processing override your rights.
During the time which restriction of processing applies, we will only process your restricted personal information with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if or when the restriction is lifted.
Right to Object to Processing: You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal bases of: consent; contract; or legitimate interests. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.
Right to Data Portability: If we process your personal information based in a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another “controller,” where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. Your right to data portability only applies to personal information provided by you to us.
Notification to Third Parties: When we fulfil your individual rights requests for correct (or rectification), erasure or restriction of processing, we will notify third parties also handling the relevant personal information unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.

17. Australia Privacy Rights
This section only applies to users of our Service that are located in Australia. We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. When we rely on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this section to any individual that masks or otherwise hides their location information from us so as not to appear located in Australia If any terms in this section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to users in Australia.
Timely will adhere to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act) in relation to the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information. A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at
https://www.oaic.gov.au/
.
In relation to Visitors, Users, and Clients located in Australia, Personal Information means information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable whether the information is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.
If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained, it will in most cases not be classified as “Personal Information” and will not be subject to this privacy policy.
Sensitive Information is defined in the Privacy Act as including information or opinion about such things as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record or health information. Timely typically does not collect or store Sensitive Information, but in the event that such information is collected via the Services, it will only be used by us for the primary purpose for which it was obtained; for a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose; and with your consent or where required or authorised by law.
Information related to the type of Personal Information we collect, how we collect your Personal Information, the purpose of collection of your Personal Information, and your Rights and Choices in relation to your Personal Information, based on your relationship with Timely, are described in the sections above and apply to Users, Clients, and Visitors located in Australia.
Your Personal Information may be transferred to our sub-service providers located in United States. United States data protection laws differ from Australia's, and we will accordingly take reasonable steps to secure a contractual commitment from United-States-based recipients to handle your information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.
If you have a complaint concerning the manner in which we maintain the privacy of your Personal Information, please contact us as on the contact details set out at the bottom of this policy. All complaints will be considered by Timely’s Privacy Officer, and we may seek further information from you to clarify your concerns. If we agree that your complaint is well founded, we will, in consultation with you, take appropriate steps to rectify the problem. If you remain dissatisfied with the outcome, you may refer the matter to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

4. How do we protect your information?
Timely has implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our thirty party vendor’s servers which utilise industry standard security controls. The Timely Sites utilise secure SSL for all form data submissions in conjunction with a 256-bit certificate. Timely does not directly store, process, or transmit bank account and credit card information. All payment processing, and collection of payment account data, is accomplished via integration with third-party service providers.
These providers are contractually required to maintain compliance with the PCI DSS – Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and with all rules for electronic funds transfers. This includes secure transmission of credit card/bank account information, and encrypted storage of all payment account information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted via our Sites or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk.
We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites or the Services. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Additionally, do not leave your device unlocked so that other individuals may access your device or account. Timely is not in control of your wireless connection or the devices you use to log into the Services, so you should make sure you trust the devices and connections you use to access the Services. If you believe that you have experienced unauthorised access or use of your account, please contact us immediately at
privacy@gettimely.com
.
5. Do we use cookies?
Certain portions of our Services may collect information via cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar digital tracking technologies. These technologies can be used to operate, secure and provide our Services by collecting and analysing information related to your use of the Services. Generally, this information is collected when you request pages from our Services, and typically includes information such as the page served, the time, the source and type of browser making the request, the most recent page view, what you clicked on to arrive at our Services, the content you viewed on our Services, and other similar information relating to your use of our Services. In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.
Other than Cookies, Timely utilises only strictly necessary and functional Cookies as part of its mobile and web-based applications.
6. Email communications
Timely sends billing information, product information, service updates and service notifications to you via email. Our emails contain clear and obvious instructions describing how you can unsubscribe from any mailing list not essential to the Service. Timely will also remove you at your request via reaching out to the Timely Support team.
7. Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
Personal Data we collect may be shared with a variety of parties depending upon the purpose for and context in which that information was provided.
We will share your Personal Data in accordance with your consent for us to do so. By utilising any Timely Services, Clients consent to their Personal Data being shared with both Timely and the Timely User with which they are doing business.
Timely works with a number of third parties and partners who help us provide the Timely Services to our Users. Examples include hosting services, accounting services, business intelligence platforms, email and SMS partners, customer relationship management services, customer support platforms and more. In order to supply the Timely service Timely may send them Personal Data for storage or processing. In all cases where we share Personal Data with third parties, we will use a “minimum necessary” standard to disclose only that information required for satisfying the purpose of or performing the service for which the information is disclosed. Timely has taken steps to ensure that each partner or third party involved treats the Personal Data in accordance with all privacy laws and regulations applicable to our Users.
In order to streamline certain business operations and improve the user experience, develop products and services that better meet the interests and needs of our customers, and inform our customers about relevant products and services, we may share a User’s or Visitor’s Personal Data with any of our current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries and parent companies (“Affiliates”). Users and Visitors hereby agree to our sharing some or all of their information and Personal Data with our Affiliates. We never share Client Personal Data with Affiliates.
Your Personal Data may be processed in the event of a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. For example, Personal Data may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process for a potential transaction or may part of the assets transferred, in such case the acquiring company will possess any rights granted to us under this Policy.
In limited circumstances, we may, without notice to you or your consent, access and disclose your Personal Data, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, and to the extent we believe such disclosure is legally required. We may also disclose your Personal Data without notice or consent to prevent or respond to a crime, to investigate violations of our Terms of Service or in the vital interests of us or any person or entity. Note, these disclosures may be made to governments that do not ensure the same degree of protection of your Personal Data as your home jurisdiction. We may, in our sole discretion (but without any obligation), object to the disclosure of your Personal Data to such parties.
Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
8. How long do we store your information?
We retain Personal Data for so long as necessary to service the purpose(s) for which your Personal Data was processed and for a reasonable time thereafter, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements. While retention requirements can vary by jurisdiction, we generally apply the retention periods noted below:
Services Usage
: We will retain Personal Data for as long as a User remains an active user of our Services and for a reasonable time thereafter, to serve the purpose(s) for which the Personal Data was processed. We may store any information about your activity on our Services, including data created, posted or shared by you while using our free or paid Services for as long as we deem it necessary or until you provide specific instructions to delete it, which may be indefinitely, or where a valid business reason exists for such storage such as retaining a comprehensive transaction history, maintaining the integrity of our systems and logs or for the establishment or defense of legal claims, audit and crime prevention purposes.
Client Data
: We may store on behalf of Users, for as long as a valid business reason exists, which may be indefinitely, any Personal Information collected about a Client or other individual, whether entered directly into our systems by the Client or whether entered by an authorised User via the Services.
Note that Users control any consumer data we collect and process on their behalf, whether that Personal Data is entered by a consumer Client or whether it is entered by a User via the Services, and it is up to the User to determine how long they will store their Clients’ Personal Information in our systems.
Site Activity
: We may store any information about your activity on our Sites or any other data created, posted or shared by you on our Sites for as long as we deem it necessary or until you provide specific instructions to delete it, which may be indefinitely, or where a valid business reason exists for such storage such as maintaining the integrity of our systems and logs or for the establishment or defense of legal claims, audit and crime prevention purposes.
Marketing
: We store information used for marketing purposes indefinitely until you unsubscribe or provide specific instructions to delete it. When you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we add your contact information to our suppression list to ensure we respect your unsubscribe request.
Cookie Data

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. By opting to take up these third party products you agree to Timely providing your information to these third parties and you acknowledge that these third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
10. Access to your account
To resolve customer support issues and queries related to your account, as well as ensure you have an optimal user experience, you consent to us both accessing and administering your account when required and where a valid and legitimate business purpose exists. If you do not wish us to access your account, then you may notify us in writing, however please note, that taking this action may prevent Timely from providing efficient trouble shooting services to you.
11. Cross-border transfer
Timely operates in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and in the United States. We host data in the United States and in Australia. Thus by accessing our Services your Personal Data may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States and in Australia and maintained on computers or servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Some information may also be stored locally on devices you use to interact with our Services. By accessing our Services you understand and consent to the transfer of your information to the United States and Australia and to those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy. If you do not want your information transferred to or processed or maintained outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located, you should not use our Services.
Please note, Timely acts as a data processor on behalf of its Users and Users are responsible for obtaining your consent relating to the collection, use, transfer and other processing of your Personal Data. Users may provide additional notices to you providing additional limitations or permissions with respect to our processing of your Personal Data in order to comply with applicable law.
12. Your rights

Rights to Your Information
Certain rights that you may have concerning your personal information are set forth in our Privacy Policy. State Privacy Laws may provide you with the following additional rights:

Right to data portability

Right to opt out of selling or sharing
: You have the right to opt out of the processing of the personal information for purposes of: (i) targeted advertising; (ii) the sale of personal information; or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you, unless you reside in Utah.

Unless permitted by State Privacy Laws, we will not deny you goods or services; charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
How to Contact Us About Your Privacy Rights
To exercise any of your privacy rights, or if you have any questions about your privacy rights, you may contact us using the information provided at the end of this Policy.
We will not fulfil any request unless we have received sufficient information for us to verify the requestor is properly authorised to make such request, and unless the request provides sufficient detail for us to properly understand, evaluate and respond.
Only you—or for Colorado and Connecticut consumers making an opt-out request, an agent legally authorised to act on your behalf—may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. If you are making an opt-out request as the authorised agent of a Colorado or Connecticut consumer, we will ask you to also submit reliable proof that you have been authorised in writing by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf.
Our Response Time to Your Request
We will make every effort to respond to your request within forty-five (45) days from when you contact us. If you have a complex request, State Privacy Laws allow us up to ninety (90) days to respond. We will still contact you within forty-five (45) days from when you contacted us to let you know we need more time to respond and the reason for the extension.
Your Right to Appeal

16. Designated Countries Privacy Rights
This section only applies to users of our Service that are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and/or Switzerland (collectively, the “Designated Countries”) at the time of data collection. We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. When we rely on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this section to any individual that masks or otherwise hides their location information from us so as not to appear located in the Designated Countries. If any terms in this section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to users in the Designated Countries.
In relation to Designated Countries, Timely only actively markets its services in the United Kingdom, but it does not actively block residents of the EU or Switzerland from using or accessing its Sites and Services. Such incidental use of Timely Services by Users located in the EEA/EU and/or Switzerland is also governed by these Designated Countries Privacy Rights.
Our Relationship to You
Timely is a data controller with regard to any personal information directly collected from Visitors and Users of its Sites and Services. A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions are our service providers and are “data processors.”
Timely acts as a service provider to Users and is a “data processor” with regard to any consumer Personal Information imported by Users into our systems via our Services—whether that consumer Personal Information is entered directly into our systems by the consumer as a Client, entered or imported by an authorised User, or imported by an authorised User third party integration. As a “data processor” Timely does not have any direct control over the purposes for which and the manner in which any Client or potential Client personal information is processed; instead processing of this Personal Information is governed by data processing agreements between Timely and our Users.
Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information
The chart below describes the legal basis Timely relies on as a data controller for processing personal information of Visitors and Users.
Purposes of Processing

Legal Basis for Processing
Processing is based on our contractual obligations or to take steps at the request of the individual prior to entering into a contract.

Processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, the public interest, or in your vital interests.
We will only contact individuals located in the Designated Countries by electronic means (including email or SMS) based on our legitimate interests, as permitted by applicable law, or the individual’s consent. When we rely on legitimate interest, we will only send you information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.
If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way, or to disclose your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes, please go to the settings for your account to opt out, click an unsubscribe link or take an unsubscribe action in any communication set to you, or contact us at privacy@gettimely.com You can object to direct marketing at any time and free of charge.
Individual Rights
We provide you with the rights described below when you use our Services. We may limit your individual rights requests (a) where denial of access is required or authorised by law; (b) when granting access would have a negative impact on other’s privacy; (c) to protect our rights and properties; or (4) where the request is frivolous or burdensome.
If you would like to exercise your rights under applicable law, please contact us at

. We may seek to verify your identity when we receive an individual rights request from you to ensure the security of your personal information.
Right to Withdraw Consent
: For any consent-based processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. A withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of our processing or the processing of any third parties based on consent before your withdrawal.
Right of Access
: Upon your request, we will provide you with a copy of your personal information in our files without undue delay and free of charge, unless we are permitted by law to charge a fee. Your access may be limited to the extent it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals.
Right to Rectification
(or “Correction”): You may request to correct or update any of your personal information in our files. We may provide you with the ability to update some or all of your personal information directly via the Services.
Right to Erasure
(or the “Right to be Forgotten”): Upon your request, we will erase any of your personal information in our files that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.
Right to Restriction
: You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where one of the following conditions applies:
You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. If you restrict processing based on this condition, you may experience an interruption of some or all of the Services during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information;
The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead;
We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of our processing override your rights.
During the time which restriction of processing applies, we will only process your restricted personal information with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if or when the restriction is lifted.
Right to Object to Processing: You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal bases of: consent; contract; or legitimate interests. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.
Right to Data Portability: If we process your personal information based in a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another “controller,” where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. Your right to data portability only applies to personal information provided by you to us.
Notification to Third Parties: When we fulfil your individual rights requests for correct (or rectification), erasure or restriction of processing, we will notify third parties also handling the relevant personal information unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.

17. Australia Privacy Rights
This section only applies to users of our Service that are located in Australia. We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. When we rely on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this section to any individual that masks or otherwise hides their location information from us so as not to appear located in Australia If any terms in this section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to users in Australia.
Timely will adhere to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act) in relation to the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information. A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at
https://www.oaic.gov.au/
.
In relation to Visitors, Users, and Clients located in Australia, Personal Information means information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable whether the information is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.
If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained, it will in most cases not be classified as “Personal Information” and will not be subject to this privacy policy.
Sensitive Information is defined in the Privacy Act as including information or opinion about such things as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record or health information. Timely typically does not collect or store Sensitive Information, but in the event that such information is collected via the Services, it will only be used by us for the primary purpose for which it was obtained; for a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose; and with your consent or where required or authorised by law.
Information related to the type of Personal Information we collect, how we collect your Personal Information, the purpose of collection of your Personal Information, and your Rights and Choices in relation to your Personal Information, based on your relationship with Timely, are described in the sections above and apply to Users, Clients, and Visitors located in Australia.
Your Personal Information may be transferred to our sub-service providers located in United States. United States data protection laws differ from Australia's, and we will accordingly take reasonable steps to secure a contractual commitment from United-States-based recipients to handle your information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.
If you have a complaint concerning the manner in which we maintain the privacy of your Personal Information, please contact us as on the contact details set out at the bottom of this policy. All complaints will be considered by Timely’s Privacy Officer, and we may seek further information from you to clarify your concerns. If we agree that your complaint is well founded, we will, in consultation with you, take appropriate steps to rectify the problem. If you remain dissatisfied with the outcome, you may refer the matter to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

4. How do we protect your information?
Timely has implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our thirty party vendor’s servers which utilise industry standard security controls. The Timely Sites utilise secure SSL for all form data submissions in conjunction with a 256-bit certificate. Timely does not directly store, process, or transmit bank account and credit card information. All payment processing, and collection of payment account data, is accomplished via integration with third-party service providers.
These providers are contractually required to maintain compliance with the PCI DSS – Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and with all rules for electronic funds transfers. This includes secure transmission of credit card/bank account information, and encrypted storage of all payment account information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted via our Sites or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk.
We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites or the Services. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Additionally, do not leave your device unlocked so that other individuals may access your device or account. Timely is not in control of your wireless connection or the devices you use to log into the Services, so you should make sure you trust the devices and connections you use to access the Services. If you believe that you have experienced unauthorised access or use of your account, please contact us immediately at
privacy@gettimely.com
.
5. Do we use cookies?
Certain portions of our Services may collect information via cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar digital tracking technologies. These technologies can be used to operate, secure and provide our Services by collecting and analysing information related to your use of the Services. Generally, this information is collected when you request pages from our Services, and typically includes information such as the page served, the time, the source and type of browser making the request, the most recent page view, what you clicked on to arrive at our Services, the content you viewed on our Services, and other similar information relating to your use of our Services. In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.

6. Email communications
Timely sends billing information, product information, service updates and service notifications to you via email. Our emails contain clear and obvious instructions describing how you can unsubscribe from any mailing list not essential to the Service. Timely will also remove you at your request via reaching out to the Timely Support team.
7. Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
Personal Data we collect may be shared with a variety of parties depending upon the purpose for and context in which that information was provided.
We will share your Personal Data in accordance with your consent for us to do so. By utilising any Timely Services, Clients consent to their Personal Data being shared with both Timely and the Timely User with which they are doing business.
Timely works with a number of third parties and partners who help us provide the Timely Services to our Users. Examples include hosting services, accounting services, business intelligence platforms, email and SMS partners, customer relationship management services, customer support platforms and more. In order to supply the Timely service Timely may send them Personal Data for storage or processing. In all cases where we share Personal Data with third parties, we will use a “minimum necessary” standard to disclose only that information required for satisfying the purpose of or performing the service for which the information is disclosed. Timely has taken steps to ensure that each partner or third party involved treats the Personal Data in accordance with all privacy laws and regulations applicable to our Users.
In order to streamline certain business operations and improve the user experience, develop products and services that better meet the interests and needs of our customers, and inform our customers about relevant products and services, we may share a User’s or Visitor’s Personal Data with any of our current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries and parent companies (“Affiliates”). Users and Visitors hereby agree to our sharing some or all of their information and Personal Data with our Affiliates. We never share Client Personal Data with Affiliates.
Your Personal Data may be processed in the event of a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. For example, Personal Data may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process for a potential transaction or may part of the assets transferred, in such case the acquiring company will possess any rights granted to us under this Policy.
In limited circumstances, we may, without notice to you or your consent, access and disclose your Personal Data, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, and to the extent we believe such disclosure is legally required. We may also disclose your Personal Data without notice or consent to prevent or respond to a crime, to investigate violations of our Terms of Service or in the vital interests of us or any person or entity. Note, these disclosures may be made to governments that do not ensure the same degree of protection of your Personal Data as your home jurisdiction. We may, in our sole discretion (but without any obligation), object to the disclosure of your Personal Data to such parties.
Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
8. How long do we store your information?
We retain Personal Data for so long as necessary to service the purpose(s) for which your Personal Data was processed and for a reasonable time thereafter, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements. While retention requirements can vary by jurisdiction, we generally apply the retention periods noted below:
Services Usage
: We will retain Personal Data for as long as a User remains an active user of our Services and for a reasonable time thereafter, to serve the purpose(s) for which the Personal Data was processed. We may store any information about your activity on our Services, including data created, posted or shared by you while using our free or paid Services for as long as we deem it necessary or until you provide specific instructions to delete it, which may be indefinitely, or where a valid business reason exists for such storage such as retaining a comprehensive transaction history, maintaining the integrity of our systems and logs or for the establishment or defense of legal claims, audit and crime prevention purposes.
Client Data
: We may store on behalf of Users, for as long as a valid business reason exists, which may be indefinitely, any Personal Information collected about a Client or other individual, whether entered directly into our systems by the Client or whether entered by an authorised User via the Services.
Note that Users control any consumer data we collect and process on their behalf, whether that Personal Data is entered by a consumer Client or whether it is entered by a User via the Services, and it is up to the User to determine how long they will store their Clients’ Personal Information in our systems.
Site Activity
: We may store any information about your activity on our Sites or any other data created, posted or shared by you on our Sites for as long as we deem it necessary or until you provide specific instructions to delete it, which may be indefinitely, or where a valid business reason exists for such storage such as maintaining the integrity of our systems and logs or for the establishment or defense of legal claims, audit and crime prevention purposes.

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. By opting to take up these third party products you agree to Timely providing your information to these third parties and you acknowledge that these third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
10. Access to your account
To resolve customer support issues and queries related to your account, as well as ensure you have an optimal user experience, you consent to us both accessing and administering your account when required and where a valid and legitimate business purpose exists.

11. Cross-border transfer
Timely operates in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and in the United States. We host data in the United States and in Australia. Thus by accessing our Services your Personal Data may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States and in Australia and maintained on computers or servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Some information may also be stored locally on devices you use to interact with our Services. By accessing our Services you understand and consent to the transfer of your information to the United States and Australia and to those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy. If you do not want your information transferred to or processed or maintained outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located, you should not use our Services.
Please note, Timely acts as a data processor on behalf of its Users and Users are responsible for obtaining your consent relating to the collection, use, transfer and other processing of your Personal Data. Users may provide additional notices to you providing additional limitations or permissions with respect to our processing of your Personal Data in order to comply with applicable law.
12. Your rights

Clients can request that the User provide you with access to your Personal Data that Timely stores on its behalf, that it make changes to that Personal Data, and/or that the Personal Data be deleted from Timely systems. Timely cannot honour such requests directly from User’s clients but will assist Users with honouring them.

Consumer Information collected through the Services is collected for our use and/or the use of the User identified at the collection point and is not transferred to any third party for valuable consideration. However, if you are a California resident, you may send us specific instructions not to sell your personal information now or in the future.

You may make this request by emailing us at the address provided below.
California residents have the right to exercise the privacy rights in this section twice within any 12-month period under the CCPA by contacting Timely at the contact information provided below. California residents may exercise these rights via an authorised agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA. Any request subject to CCPA is subject to an identification and residency verification process. We will not fulfil any CCPA request unless we have received sufficient information for us to verify the requestor is properly authorised to make such request and the request provides sufficient detail for us to properly understand, evaluate and respond.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA: we will not deny you goods or services; charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; provide you a different level or quality of good or services; or suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
15. Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Similar U.S. State Privacy Rights
The Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and such other U.S. states that have comparable consumer privacy laws (“State Privacy Laws”) provide their consumers with specific rights regarding their personal information. To the extent that you are a resident of one of these states, this section describes your rights under the State Privacy Laws and explains how you may exercise these rights.
This section only applies to User and Visitor users of our Services with whom we have a data controller relationship and that have rights under the State Privacy Laws. Any resident with rights under the State Privacy Laws with whom Timely has a data processor relationship (Clients) must contact the User(s) utilising Timely Services to exercise these rights. Timely cannot honour such requests directly from Clients or other consumers but will assist Users with honouring them.
The categories of personal information we process, our purposes for processing your personal information, the categories of personal information that we share with third parties, and the categories of third parties with whom we share it are detailed above in this Privacy Policy.
Rights to Your Information
Certain rights that you may have concerning your personal information are set forth in our Privacy Policy. State Privacy Laws may provide you with the following additional rights:
Right to know
: You have the right to know whether we process your personal information. If you are a resident of Oregon, you also have the rights to (i) confirm additional information about the categories of personal information we have processed about you; and (ii) obtain a list of third parties to which we have disclosed personal information of Oregon consumers.
Right to data portability
: You have the right to access and obtain a copy of your personal information that you previously provided to us in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another business without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means. You may request such personal information up to twice annually, subject to certain exceptions.
Right to delete
: You have the right to delete personal information that you have provided or that we have obtained about you. Please note that we may deny such requests if the requested deletion falls under an exception to this right set forth in State Privacy Laws. Additionally, if you request deletion of your personal information and we have obtained such information from a third-party source, we may retain such data by keeping a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary to ensure that your personal information remains deleted from our records and that such retained data is not used for any other purpose, or we may opt you out of the processing of such personal information for any purpose except for those allowed under State Privacy Laws. Some State Privacy Laws, like the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, limit this right to only the data you have provided us.
Right to opt out of selling or sharing
: You have the right to opt out of the processing of the personal information for purposes of: (i) targeted advertising; (ii) the sale of personal information; or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you, unless you reside in Utah. We may process personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising; we DO NOT sell your personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration; and we DO NOT engage in profiling decisions based on your personal information that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you. If you wish to opt out of the processing of your personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising you may email us at the address provided below. For residents of Colorado, we will also treat opt-out preference signals as valid opt-out requests to the extent required by Colorado law.
Right to correct
: Unless you reside in Utah, you have the right to correct inaccuracies in the personal information we collect from you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes for which we process it.
Right to nondiscrimination
: You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy rights. Unless permitted by State Privacy Laws, we will not deny you goods or services; charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
How to Contact Us About Your Privacy Rights
To exercise any of your privacy rights, or if you have any questions about your privacy rights, you may contact us using the information provided at the end of this Policy.
We will not fulfil any request unless we have received sufficient information for us to verify the requestor is properly authorised to make such request, and unless the request provides sufficient detail for us to properly understand, evaluate and respond.
Only you—or for Colorado and Connecticut consumers making an opt-out request, an agent legally authorised to act on your behalf—may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. If you are making an opt-out request as the authorised agent of a Colorado or Connecticut consumer, we will ask you to also submit reliable proof that you have been authorised in writing by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf.
Our Response Time to Your Request
We will make every effort to respond to your request within forty-five (45) days from when you contact us. If you have a complex request, State Privacy Laws allow us up to ninety (90) days to respond. We will still contact you within forty-five (45) days from when you contacted us to let you know we need more time to respond and the reason for the extension.
Your Right to Appeal
If we decline to take action regarding a request that you have submitted, we will inform you of our reason for declining to take action and, unless you are a Utah resident, provide instructions for how to appeal the decision. In the event that we do not respond to a request that you make pursuant to one of the privacy rights set forth in this section, unless you are a Utah resident, you have the right to appeal our refusal to take action within a reasonable period of time after you receive our decision. Within 60 days (45 for residents of Colorado) of our receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, we will also provide you with a method through which you may contact your state attorney general’s office to submit a complaint.
16. Designated Countries Privacy Rights
This section only applies to users of our Service that are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and/or Switzerland (collectively, the “Designated Countries”) at the time of data collection. We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. When we rely on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this section to any individual that masks or otherwise hides their location information from us so as not to appear located in the Designated Countries. If any terms in this section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to users in the Designated Countries.
In relation to Designated Countries, Timely only actively markets its services in the United Kingdom, but it does not actively block residents of the EU or Switzerland from using or accessing its Sites and Services. Such incidental use of Timely Services by Users located in the EEA/EU and/or Switzerland is also governed by these Designated Countries Privacy Rights.
Our Relationship to You
Timely is a data controller with regard to any personal information directly collected from Visitors and Users of its Sites and Services. A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions are our service providers and are “data processors.”
Timely acts as a service provider to Users and is a “data processor” with regard to any consumer Personal Information imported by Users into our systems via our Services—whether that consumer Personal Information is entered directly into our systems by the consumer as a Client, entered or imported by an authorised User, or imported by an authorised User third party integration. As a “data processor” Timely does not have any direct control over the purposes for which and the manner in which any Client or potential Client personal information is processed; instead processing of this Personal Information is governed by data processing agreements between Timely and our Users.

Processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, the public interest, or in your vital interests.
We will only contact individuals located in the Designated Countries by electronic means (including email or SMS) based on our legitimate interests, as permitted by applicable law, or the individual’s consent. When we rely on legitimate interest, we will only send you information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.
If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way, or to disclose your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes, please go to the settings for your account to opt out, click an unsubscribe link or take an unsubscribe action in any communication set to you, or contact us at privacy@gettimely.com You can object to direct marketing at any time and free of charge.

Right to Withdraw Consent
: For any consent-based processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. A withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of our processing or the processing of any third parties based on consent before your withdrawal.
Right of Access
: Upon your request, we will provide you with a copy of your personal information in our files without undue delay and free of charge, unless we are permitted by law to charge a fee. Your access may be limited to the extent it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals.
Right to Rectification
(or “Correction”): You may request to correct or update any of your personal information in our files. We may provide you with the ability to update some or all of your personal information directly via the Services.
Right to Erasure
(or the “Right to be Forgotten”): Upon your request, we will erase any of your personal information in our files that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.
Right to Restriction
: You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where one of the following conditions applies:
You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. If you restrict processing based on this condition, you may experience an interruption of some or all of the Services during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information;
The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead;
We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of our processing override your rights.
During the time which restriction of processing applies, we will only process your restricted personal information with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if or when the restriction is lifted.
Right to Object to Processing: You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal bases of: consent; contract; or legitimate interests. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.
Right to Data Portability: If we process your personal information based in a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another “controller,” where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. Your right to data portability only applies to personal information provided by you to us.
Notification to Third Parties: When we fulfil your individual rights requests for correct (or rectification), erasure or restriction of processing, we will notify third parties also handling the relevant personal information unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.

17. Australia Privacy Rights
This section only applies to users of our Service that are located in Australia. We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. When we rely on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this section to any individual that masks or otherwise hides their location information from us so as not to appear located in Australia If any terms in this section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to users in Australia.
Timely will adhere to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act) in relation to the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information. A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at
https://www.oaic.gov.au/
.
In relation to Visitors, Users, and Clients located in Australia, Personal Information means information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable whether the information is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.
If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained, it will in most cases not be classified as “Personal Information” and will not be subject to this privacy policy.
Sensitive Information is defined in the Privacy Act as including information or opinion about such things as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record or health information. Timely typically does not collect or store Sensitive Information, but in the event that such information is collected via the Services, it will only be used by us for the primary purpose for which it was obtained; for a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose; and with your consent or where required or authorised by law.
Information related to the type of Personal Information we collect, how we collect your Personal Information, the purpose of collection of your Personal Information, and your Rights and Choices in relation to your Personal Information, based on your relationship with Timely, are described in the sections above and apply to Users, Clients, and Visitors located in Australia.
Your Personal Information may be transferred to our sub-service providers located in United States. United States data protection laws differ from Australia's, and we will accordingly take reasonable steps to secure a contractual commitment from United-States-based recipients to handle your information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.
If you have a complaint concerning the manner in which we maintain the privacy of your Personal Information, please contact us as on the contact details set out at the bottom of this policy. All complaints will be considered by Timely’s Privacy Officer, and we may seek further information from you to clarify your concerns. If we agree that your complaint is well founded, we will, in consultation with you, take appropriate steps to rectify the problem. If you remain dissatisfied with the outcome, you may refer the matter to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
