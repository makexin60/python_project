Our Privacy Policy
Last Updated:
Jan 6th, 2025
We are a wellness platform. We provide a digital platform with coaching and team challenges to help our members achieve their wellness goals. When you use these services, you’ll share some information with us. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access, update, and delete your information. That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our
Terms of Service
All individuals whose responsibilities include the processing of any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Personal Information”) on behalf of Wellness Coach are expected to protect that data by adherence to this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
There are two basic categories of information we collect:
- Information you choose to give us
- Information we get when you use our services
Information You Choose to Give Us
When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up an account or log into our services using 3rd party accounts such as Google and Facebook, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username, password, email address, gender, city, and age. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask for some additional information that will be publicly visible, such as profile pictures, a name, or other identifying information.
Health Data Collection and Use
It's your choice to share your health data with us. We collect data from sources like Apple Health, Google Health, and/or connected wearables to help our members understand their wellness patterns and offer tailored recommendations. This data can include metrics related to sleep, steps, workouts, and other wellness indicators. This data is also used for team challenges (e.g., syncing step count for leaderboards).
Nutrition by Wellness Coach
Our Nutrition by Wellness Coach feature allows you to capture images of your meals or drinks and calculates their nutritional value. To provide accurate recommendations and help you achieve your wellness goals, we also collect and use information you provide about your weight, height, and age. This data is processed solely to offer personalized insights and to tailor your experience.
Health Data Consent
By connecting your Apple Health, Google Health, or any health account to our platform, you provide explicit consent for us to access and use your health data as described in this Privacy Policy. You can revoke this consent at any time by disconnecting your accounts or contacting our support team.
Personal 1-1 Coaching Sessions
For personal 1-1 coaching sessions, we now collect AI-generated summaries of the sessions. These summaries capture key takeaways and recommendations discussed during the session and are shared with both the coach and the user. The summaries are also used within the platform to improve and personalize future recommendations for the user, helping to enhance their overall wellness experience.
Information We Get When You Use Our Services
We collect data on how you use our services, including:
- Usage Information: We collect information on how you interact with our services (e.g., what videos you watch, how often you participate in live classes).
- Content Information: We collect details like profile pictures, names, email addresses, city, gender, age, and audio/video from live sessions.
- Device Information: Information such as hardware model, operating system, language, battery level, and time zone.

Data Security and Encryption
At Wellness Coach, we take data security seriously. Our practices include:
- Encryption: We use strong encryption to secure your data in transit and at rest.
- Secure Data Transmission: All communication is encrypted using HTTPS with TLS to prevent interception.
- Regular Audits: We perform regular security audits and engage third-party experts to strengthen our defenses.
Data Retention
We ensure that we do not retain Personal Information longer than necessary in compliance with applicable laws. When Personal Information is no longer needed, we have processes to securely delete it. This applies to all forms of data, including account details, health metrics, and activity logs, ensuring that we only retain information for as long as it is relevant to providing our services or as required by legal obligations.
How We Use Information
We use the information we collect in the following ways:
- To develop, operate, and improve our products and services.

- To monitor trends and usage.

- To enhance safety and security.
- To verify your identity and prevent fraud.
- To enforce our Terms of Service.
Use of Large Language Model (LLM)
Our app utilizes a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) to provide responses. Please be aware that the information generated may not always be accurate, complete, or up-to-date. The model is designed to generate human-like text based on patterns in the data it was trained on, but it can sometimes produce incorrect or misleading information.
We recommend that users verify critical information independently and exercise caution when making decisions based on the app’s responses. For professional advice, please consult a qualified expert.
How We Share Information
We may share information about you in the following ways:
- With Coaches and other users: Sharing usernames, profile pictures, and interaction details.
- With the general public: Publicly sharing information like names or profile pictures.
- With service providers: Sharing information with service providers who perform services on our behalf.
- With third parties for legal reasons: Sharing data as necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect rights, or investigate violations.
- In case of mergers: Sharing data in the event of a merger or acquisition.
Single Sign-On (SSO)
For enterprise clients, we offer Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities, ensuring streamlined login processes while maintaining security and privacy.
Users in the European Union
For EU residents, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This section outlines our responsibilities as data controllers, our legal basis for processing data, and your rights as users, including the right to access, correct, or delete your data.
Revisions to the Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we’ll notify you by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy and providing additional notice (such as via an in-app notification).
