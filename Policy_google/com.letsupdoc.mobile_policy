                                    Navigator, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to
                                    access a site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a userâ€™s web browser
                                    on one site to simplify subsequent interactions with that site by the same user or
                                    to use the information to streamline the user's transaction on related web pages.

                                    cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
                                    prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
