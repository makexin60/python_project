Privacy Policy
At Vishtek Studios LLP, we take your privacy very seriously, we strictly respect your privacy and user privacy is one of our highest priorities. We do not record, store, collect any personal information(information that identifies you as an individual). We do not attempt to obtain any sensitive information. However, we may keep a copy of your email ID if you contact us directly.
Vishtek Studios LLP will not sell, trade or disclose any personal information you might give us without your prior consent. However, information will be disclosed where required by law. We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 18.
By downloading and installing the apps on your mobile device or wearable using the apps, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this privacy policy.
We do not collect any information from anyone under 18 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old or older.
If you are under the age of eighteen (18) you hereby represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to this Privacy Policy.
Media Metadata Info uses Admob for showing ads in apps. We don’t collect any usage data in this app. Google play services automatically collects anonymous app install/uninstall data for displaying in the Google Play developer console(play install statistics). We don’t collect any usage data in this app.
We have also added consent dialog for showing Admob ads. This consent dialog is shown to European users and ads are served on the basis of user’s preference of data selection. European users also have the ability to revoke their consent anytime through the ‘Change Consent’ button in ‘Settings’ page.
CCPA related
We have restricted data processing under CCPA section in Admob to protect user privacy in serving Ads. Even though this means reduced Ad revenue, we consider user privacy at one of the highest
priorities
. By default all our apps and ad-units have restricted CCPA data processing.
What this means:
Restrict data processing
: Google will only show non-personalized ads from Google demand to eligible users in California.
(From https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9561022)
So, by default we only show non-personalized ads from Google to eligible users in California.
GPDR related
We only show non-personalized ads by default under the GPDR section in Admob. Under the GPDR regulations, users are still shown an UMP consent dialog to give consent to view personalized or non-personalized ads. The default selection for all our ads based on GPDR is non-personalised ads, even though this means lesser revenue, users privacy is our top most priority. In the UMP consent dialog if ‘Do not consent’ is selected, it serves limited or no ads. European users also have the ability to revoke their consent anytime through the ‘Change Consent’ button in ‘Settings’ page.
Users in the EU region can also upgrade to the pro-version to remove ads in the app completely.
Consent dialog is not applicable to Pro version(ad free) users in EU as ads are not requested or shown once an user upgrades to the Pro version.
We use the following third parties
Google Admob
For Banner Ads.
