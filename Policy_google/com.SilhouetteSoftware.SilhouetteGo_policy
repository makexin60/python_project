Submission of ideas
of Silhouette America®, Inc.
Silhouette America® appreciates the willingness of any individual to submit ideas that will expand the company's product offerings or to improve existing products. Silhouette America® may accept disclosures from non-employees only if there is a clear understanding of the basis on which the disclosure is made. Ideas should not be submitted to the company without an express understanding of the points below.
If you (the individual submitting an idea to Silhouette America®) believe your idea has significant commercial value or if you expect Silhouette America® to compensate you for the idea, you must obtain a written agreement signed by an authorized company officer before disclosing the idea to Silhouette America®.
In the absence of a written agreement between you and Silhouette America® that clearly supersedes or modifies this policy, the following provisions will apply:
You must be the owner. By submitting an idea, you represent to Silhouette America® that you are the owner (or have authority to act on behalf of the owner) of the idea, including any copyrights, patents, or trade secrets.
You must not violate any duties to others. By submitting the idea, you represent to Silhouette America® that you are not disclosing any confidential or proprietary information belonging to a third party (except as an authorized agent of the third party) or violating any obligation that you may have to a third party such as an employer, former employer, or partner.
Silhouette America® is not obligated to hold any information relayed as confidential. No confidential relationship is to be established or implied by your submission of the idea or Silhouette America®'s consideration of the idea. Silhouette America® will have no obligation to maintain the secrecy of the idea or any related information.
You understand that Silhouette America® might already be working on something similar.

By submitting the idea without a prior written agreement, you acknowledge and accept the possibility that Silhouette America® may use the idea without paying any compensation or remuneration to you of any kind, and Silhouette America® will have the unrestricted right to do so unless use of the idea constitutes an infringement of a valid patent.

California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
—updated July 29, 2015
The first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy, the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) went into effect in 2004. It was amended in 2013 to require new privacy disclosures regarding tracking of online visits.
CalOPPA applies to any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) whose website collects personally identifiable information from California consumers. CalOPPA requires the website to feature a conspicuous privacy policy stating exactly what information is collected and with whom it is shared; it also requires the operator of the website or online service to comply with the site’s privacy policy. Those who fail to do so are at risk of civil litigation under the state’s Unfair Competition Law.
Who does CalOPPA apply to?
CalOPPA applies to any person or entity that owns or operates a commercial website or online service that “collects and maintains personally identifiable information from a consumer residing in California who uses or visits” said website or online service. CalOPPA does not apply to Internet service providers or similar entities that transmit or store personally identifiable information for a third party.
In 2012, the California Attorney General’s Office specifically applied CalOPPA to mobile applications for smartphones and tablets that collect personally identifiable information. Hundreds of apps providers were notified that they were in violation of CalOPPA, and they were given 30 days to submit compliance plans or face fines of up to $2,500 for each time their app was downloaded.
What is “personally identifiable information”?
As legally defined, “personally identifiable information” refers to details collected on the Internet about an individual consumer, including an individual’s first and last name, a physical street address, an email address, a telephone number, a Social Security number, or any other information that permits a specific individual to be contacted physically or online. The term extends to details such as a person’s birthday, height, weight or hair color that are collected online and stored by an operator in personally identifiable form.
What is required under CalOPPA?
The operator of a commercial website or online service must conspicuously post a privacy policy on its website. According to CalOPPA, conspicuously posting a privacy policy means:
The privacy policy is shown on the website’s homepage; or
A link – via an icon that contains the word “privacy” – appears on the homepage and directly takes consumers to the privacy policy. In this instance, the icon must be in a color different from the homepage’s background; or
The privacy policy is linked to the homepage via a hypertext link that contains the word “privacy,” is written in capital letters equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text; is displayed in a type, font or color that contrasts with the surrounding text of the same size; or is otherwise distinguishable from surrounding text on the homepage.
CalOPPA also requires website operators to adhere to their stated privacy policy. As May 2014 guidance from the California Attorney General’s Office says, “It requires them to say what they do and do what they say – to conspicuously post a privacy policy and to comply with it.”
To be considered in compliance with CalOPPA, the website’s privacy policy must contain the following:
A list of the categories of personally identifiable information the operator collects;
A list of the categories of third parties with whom the operator may share such personally identifiable information;
A description of the process (if any) by which the consumer can review and request changes to his or her personally identifiable information as collected by the operator;
A description of the process by which the operator notifies consumers of material changes to the operator’s privacy policy; and
The effective date of the privacy policy.
An operator will be considered in violation of CalOPPA if it fails to post a privacy policy within 30 days after being notified of noncompliance. An operator who fails to comply with CalOPPA or with the terms of its privacy policy will be found to be in violation of CalOPPA only if its noncompliance is either knowing and willful or negligent and material. This means that a non-material (i.e., minor) but deliberate breach can give rise to liability. As a result, minor technical defects in the posting or the contents of a privacy policy could be a basis for liability.
AB 370 Requires New Privacy Disclosures
Assembly Bill 370 (Muratsuchi), signed into law in 2013, amended CalOPPA to require new privacy policy disclosures for websites and online services’ tracking of visitors, defined in the legislative analysis of the bill as “the monitoring of an individual across multiple websites to build a profile of behavior and interests.”
AB 370 was in part driven by the advent of “Do Not Track” computer coding, which can signal websites when visitors indicate they prefer not to be monitored. AB 370 is intended to bring greater transparency and consumer scrutiny to website practices, but it does not limit tracking.
As the bill’s author, Assembly Member Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance) explained, “This bill would increase consumer awareness of the practice of online tracking by websites and online services, such as mobile apps. AB 370 will allow consumers to learn from a website’s privacy policy whether or not that website honors a Do Not Track signal. This will allow the consumer to make an informed decision about their use of the website or service.”
Under AB 370, privacy policies for websites or online services used by California residents (includes mobile apps for smartphones and tablets) are required to:
Disclose how a business’s website or online service responds to Do Not Track signals from Web browsers.
Disclose whether third parties may collect visitors’ personally identifiable information on a business’s website or online service.
Provide “a clear and conspicuous hyperlink in the operator’s privacy policy to an online location containing a description, including the effects, of any program or protocol the operator follows that offers the consumer that choice.”
What are the consequences of noncompliance?
CalOPPA does not contain enforcement provisions. It is expected, however, that CalOPPA will be enforced through California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL), which is located at Business and Professions Code §§ 17200-17209. Under the UCL the California Attorney General’s Office, district attorneys, and some city and county attorneys can file suit against businesses for acts of “unfair competition,” which are considered to be any act involving business that violates California law. As a result, violations of CalOPPA may be considered violations of the UCL. Government officials bringing suit for violations of CalOPPA may seek civil penalties and equitable relief under the UCL. In addition, the UCL provides that private plaintiffs may assert private claims for violations of CalOPPA under the UCL.
Operators who violate CalOPPA may also be susceptible to actions by the Federal Trade Commission, which may bring enforcement action against businesses whose posted privacy policy is deceptive – that is, where a business fails to comply with its posted privacy policy.

Data Privacy Framework
We comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) (collectively, the “DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal information received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  We have also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal information received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF, and to view our certification page, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov
.  We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).
EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to the DPF Principles. European Union, United Kingdom, or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact us by sending us an e-mail at privacy@drip.com.
Complaints per the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF
We further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the DPF Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, JAMS. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, EU, UK, and Swiss residents may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Data Privacy Framework Annex 1 at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2.
Onward Transfer to Third Parties
In the event that we disclose your personal information to third parties to perform certain business-related services on our behalf as our “agents” (as such term is utilized under the Data Privacy Framework), we will do so only for limited and specified purposes consistent with any notice provided to you or your choices regarding processing and disclosure. These companies perform services at our instruction and pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required under the DPF and notify us if they are no longer able to provide such protections, at which point we will take reasonable remedial steps.
Our accountability for personal information that we receive under the DPF and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the DPF Principles. We remain responsible and liable under the DPF Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process the personal information on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Note that, in certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information of EU, UK, and/or Swiss individuals in response to lawful requests from public authorities, including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
Your DPF Rights
Upon request, we will confirm whether we are processing your personal information pursuant to the DPF and provide you with the data a reasonable time. You also have the right to correct, amend, or delete the personal information processed pursuant to the DPF where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of our privacy disclosures to you, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. We may require payment of a non-excessive fee to defray our expenses in this regard. You may also have the opportunity to opt-out of sharing of personal information with third parties other than our agents or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.
Personal Information Retention
We will retain the personal information processed pursuant to the DPF in a form that identifies you pursuant to our retention policy described above. We may continue processing such personal information for longer periods, but only for the time and to the extent such processing reasonably serves the purposes of archiving in the public interest, journalism, literature and art, scientific or historical research and statistical analysis, and subject to the protection of our privacy disclosures. After such time periods have expired, we may either delete your personal information or retain it in a form such that it does not identify you personally.

In accordance with applicable privacy law, you have the following rights in respect of your personal information that we hold:
Right of access and portability. The right to obtain access to and to receive your personal information.

Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s and DAA’s or Your Online Choices online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.
Furthermore, some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.
