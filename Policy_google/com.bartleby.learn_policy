Personal Data We Collect
When you use our Services
Our Services collect different personal data when you sign up
            and use them. For details on the personal data that we collect and the categories of third parties with whom
            your personal data is shared when you use each Service, please read the relevant Part Two section for that
            Service.
When you Report Inappropriate Content or Submit a Notice of Copyright Infringement
When you report content on a Learneo Service utilizing the
Learneo Report Content Form
, we will collect your contact information (including your first and last name, address, country, and email address) so that we can remain in contact with you during the process and ensure that your notice is sufficiently addressed.  This information will be used to process your request and keep a record of your notice. If you uploaded content on a Learneo Service that is reported to us as violating our Terms of Service, and you submit a request for reconsideration or a counter-notice (in the case of an allegation of copyright infringement), we may send a copy of your request/counter-notice (which includes your contact information) to the original notice sender, to inform them that we may reinstate the disabled content on the Services in accordance with applicable law.
We will not use the personal data we collected for materially
            different, unrelated or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.
When You Communicate With Us
When you communicate with us in written or email correspondence for any reason (such as for support, general information, or when you provide feedback), we collect your mailing or email address (as applicable) and any other personal data you may provide with your correspondence.
Information That is Not Personal Data
We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the personal data we collect, including by removing
            information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated,
            de-identified or anonymized data within Learneo and share it with third parties for our lawful business
            purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that we will not
            share such data in a manner that could identify you.
Our Purposes: How We Use Your Personal Data
When you use any of our Services, we use the personal data we collect for the following purposes:

Tracking Tools, Advertising and Your Choices
Learneo and our third-party providers collect information
            in the Services through tracking technologies, including but not limited to, cookies (small pieces of
            information or text files that a website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and is stored in a
            file on your computer's hard drive), web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded
            scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking
            methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed ("Tracking Technologies").
            Further details about the Tracking Technologies we use (including the purpose for using them),
            interest-based advertising, your choices and how to manage cookies and do-not-track signals are below, and can
            also be found in each Service's respective Cookie Policy, linked in each Service's
Part Two
section of this Privacy Policy
Advertising
We may serve ads on our Services or on external services
            and engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services
            and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing,
            across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device
            usage, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral
            advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a
            third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). Our advertisers'
            and ad networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies. Further details about interest-based advertising, your choices and how to manage related cookies can also be found in each Service's respective Cookie Policy, linked in each Service's
Part Two section of this Privacy Policy
.
Your Cookies and Tracking Technologies Choices
We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information
            about interactions with the Services, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.
            Tracking Technologies make Web-surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use
            the saved information to facilitate and improve your use of the Services.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or
                removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the
                future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may
                need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to
                some Tracking Technologies, such as HTML5 cookies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these
                technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your
                ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and
                limitations.
Some App-related Tracking Technologies in
                connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by
                uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset
                manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other
                tracking, but these may not be completely effective.
Your browser settings may allow you to
                automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however,
                there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this
                context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do
                Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not
                Track," you can visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com
, but we
                are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information. You have the right
                to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to "do not
                track" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the "Contact Information for Specific Learneo Services" section above.
Many advertisers and service providers that
                perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that
                provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising
                Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn
                more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members,
                visit
https://youradchoices.com/
,
                and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some
                of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn
                more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
.
Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt
                out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.
                Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain
                interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content
                and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
                you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web
                browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may
                not, or may no longer, be effective.
We support IAB 2009
                Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (
https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf
) and expect that ad networks that we directly engage to serve you
                interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. We are not
                responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or
                programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
In addition, we may serve ads on third-party
                services that are targeted to reach people on those third-party services that are also identified on one or more of
                our databases ("Matched List Ads"). This is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by
                matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services. We are not
                responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. We
                are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out
                instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may
                change their options without notice to us or you. For more information, please see the selling and
                sharing sections of the applicable State-Specific Rights section.
If you are located in the EEA, UK or Canada, you
                can manage your cookie consent choices using the consent management platform on the applicable Service. If you do not wish to accept non-Essential Cookies in connection with your use of the
                Services or wish to withdraw your consent, you can opt out by selecting “Reject All” or by selecting "Customize" (or similarly phrased options) and
                changing your Cookies Preferences
Session Replay Tools
On certain pages of certain Learneo Services, we use session
            replay tools provided by third party service providers, including Fullstory, Inc., Amplitude Inc., and
            Microsoft. Session replay tools are a necessary tool for Learneo to provide our Services. These tools
            allow Learneo to understand user activity and content performance to help deliver and optimize our Services,
            find and fix performance issues, continuously improve our user's experience, and to investigate and prevent fraud and abuse. Depending on how
            you use our Services, our session replay tools may automatically collect the following information:
Device-dependent data collected by your computer and web browser:
IP address
E-mail address including your first and last name, insofar as you have provided it to us via our Services
Screen size of your terminal
Device browser information and identifiers
Geographical data (country only)
Language for displaying our website
User interactions
Mouse commands (movement, position and clicks)
Date and time of access
Keystrokes (not for sensitive fields like passwords or credit card information)
Our session replay tools service providers use this
            information to evaluate your use of our Services, to compile reports on usage and to provide us similar services for evaluating our website. Our session replay service providers themselves also use third-party services (e.g. Google) to provide
            these services, who may store or otherwise process information that your browser transmits when you visit our
            certain Services (including, under certain circumstances, your IP address).
For more information about the session replay tools we use, see:
Fullstory Privacy Policy

                the How We Use Your Personal Data section above.
Business Transfers. If we undergo a merger,
                acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which a third party assumes control of our business (in
                whole or in part), your personal data may be transferred to that third party. Should one of these events
                occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to
                different privacy and security policies and practices.
Details of the categories of personal data and the third
            parties with whom we share your personal data that we have collected over the past 12 months may be found in the
            relevant Part Two section for each Service below.
Sharing With Government Authorities and Law Enforcement
When you use our Services, we may access and share the personal data described
            in the applicable Part Two section with regulators, law enforcement, or other government agencies as required by
            applicable law or if we have a good-faith belief that we must do so to comply with court orders or government
            requests supported with legal process. We may also do so for the purposes of detecting, investigating and
            preventing fraud or illegal activity on our Services, and to protect the rights and safety of our users. If we share your personal information with government or law enforcement to comply with a court order or other legal process, we will notify you of that disclosure unless we are legally obligated not to do so. For
            information on the categories of information that may be shared for the purposes and the legal bases for doing
            so, see the
Additional Terms For European Economic Area And UK Residents
section in this Policy.
Marketing Communications
When you register an account or
            subscribe to a Service, you will receive marketing communications related to Learneo's learning and productivity services as
            well as transactional and account-related communications,  by email and as permitted by applicable law. We will collect
            your email address as well as other information you provide on a voluntary basis to help tailor communications
            to you. In any marketing communication from a Learneo Service, you can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the
            "unsubscribe" link included at the bottom of each email. You may also opt-out of receiving marketing
            communications at any time either through your account settings or by contacting us (see
Contact Us
section above). Please note that you will continue to receive transactional or account-related communications.
Data Security
We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your
            personal data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational
            and administrative security measures based on the type of personal data and how we are processing that
            data.
Examples of data security measures we implement include
            regular security vulnerability scanning of our Services in order to make your visit to or use of our Services as
            safe as possible; maintaining personal data behind secured networks that are only accessible by a limited
            number of persons with special access rights to such systems and who are under obligation to keep the
            information confidential; and implementing a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or
            accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal data.
You should also help protect your data by appropriately
            selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or
            device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect
            the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of
            transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.
Data Retention
We will retain your personal data as described in the applicable
Part Two
section for the relevant Service you are using.
Changes To This Privacy Policy
We are constantly working to grow our business and improve
            our Services, offer new Services and features to you, and keep up with applicable laws. For these reasons
            we may need to change this privacy policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will
            provide you with a reasonable form of online notice of the updated policy.
Additional Terms For Canadian Residents
If you reside in Canada, the following additional terms
            apply. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this policy, the provision
            that is more protective of personal data will apply.
Transfers of Personal Data Outside Canada
We may transfer your personal data within Learneo, with

                    Framework (DPF), where applicable), we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decision for the US.
Standard Contractual Clauses
: Transfers to countries that don't have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses (together with the UK Annex
                    for transfers from the UK), which we use for transfers to countries including but not limited to the US (where the
                    recipient does not participate in the DPF), and Singapore.
In certain circumstances, cross border transfers may take place on the basis of exemptions provided for under
            applicable data protection law.
You may always contact us to request a copy of the transfer measures that we have taken to safeguard the transfer of
            your personal data.

Government ID
To the extent we collect any government ID (such as driver's license, photo card, etc), we recognise that
            government ID is a special category of personal information that is subject to a higher standard of privacy

            identity verification purpose set out in this privacy policy or for a purpose permitted under APP 9. We will not
            handle your government ID in any other manner or for any other purpose. Subject to any retention requirements under

            Israel, India, The Netherlands, and Canada or other countries as might be the case in the future. We will only
            transfer your personal data overseas for the same purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Personal data that is
            stored overseas may not be subject to the APA or the APPs. However, we will not transfer or permit any of your
            personal data to be transferred outside of Australia unless we have taken reasonable steps to ensure the transfer is
            in compliance with applicable laws, and in any case to a recipient that has privacy protections in place which are
            at least substantially similar to which the APPs protect information.

Additional Terms for Mexican Residents
Purposes and Consent
For residents of Mexico, all of the purposes listed in this privacy policy are considered necessary for the existence, continuity and fulfilling of our contractual
            relationship with you and are considered primary purposes. Learneo therefore does not require your express consent for
            the processing of your data for these purposes.

Data Retention
Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable
                        law or regulation, when you use a Course Hero Service, we retain your personal information for as long as that Course Hero Services account remains open with us, and for as
                        long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. In the event that you choose to register for multiple Course Hero Services using the same email address, we may link your accounts (as stated on the applicable sign-up page), and if we do, we will retain all of your personal data in a single Course Hero Services profile associated with that email, and for the same duration.  In some cases, we retain personal
                        information for longer and for other legitimate purposes, including if doing so is necessary to comply with our
                        legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our
                        rights, property and users, to resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by
                        applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form, where
                        that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case
                        basis. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable
                        legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm
                        from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal
                        information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We will maintain certain types
                        of personal information for a limited duration. For example, we keep account information like your account
                        email address for as long as your account is in existence, because we need it to operate your account.
In addition to the above, as stated in the
When You Use Our AI-Powered Search, Question Prompts, or Chat Features section
above, any data input into an AI-powered chat or search feature in Course Hero Services may be stored for up to 120 days, and otherwise in accordance with our business data retention and deletion policies.

When you use our Services, we collect the following information:
Usage information (such as the date and time of visits, pages viewed, links to/from any page, and time spent in a session)

                            (IP) address, Internet service provider, operating system, computer model, language settings and CPU
                            details, and web browser type)
Inference Information about your usage of
                            QuillBot, such as whether you are a frequent document uploader or user of a particular feature. We also make inferences about the text you input in order to provide you a better experience, for example by categorizing your text inputs to suggest the best QuillBot feature for your uses.
Location information (approximated, based on your
                            IP address).
We may also collect personal data you provide or otherwise make available to us when you use different features in our Services. For example:
We collect your text inputs or other information you provide in any of our Services, including any personal data contained within.
When you use the Plagiarism Checker, we store a
                            copy of your document, which includes any information contained within.
When you use our Paraphraser tool, we will collect
                            any information you paraphrase, including personal data you enter into Paraphraser.
When you upload documents to our Services, we will
                            store both a copy of the original document (or the text of the original document) as well as any outputs we provide (like the
                            paraphrased version) and any information contained within those outputs.
When you use QuillBot Flow, we will collect any information, including personal data, you enter into your project(s)
                            within the editor.
When you use our voice recognition features for audio to text conversion, the audio to text conversion
                            occurs in real time and audio is not stored by us; however, the text converted from audio input that is added by you to
                            your project(s) is stored by us in accordance with this policy.
Collected when you use QuillBot's Browser Extensions
When you use QuillBot's browser extensions, the
                        contents in the email you prepare and receive, chat messages you write (excluding history or chats received),
                        documents you create, search queries, and text you input on multiline fields on websites you visit ("Your
                        Content"), as transmitted by you in connection with your use of our extension, will be used in real time
                        on our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs, after which Your Content is deleted from our Services. We
                        only store Your Content after you provide your consent, which you can revoke at any time within the
                        extension icon found on the right top corner of your browser.
When you use QuillBot's Chrome extension, we will
                        store your Command Data, which includes the text and metadata (including any personal data as described in this
                        Privacy Policy) of any command that you provide to QuillBot to perform a specific function. For example, when
                        you provide the command "Write an email for a business proposal," we will store that text and the
                        metadata associated with it, including your personal data like your QuillBot account and browser information. We
                        use the Command Data we store to understand usage, optimize our Services, and provide the best experience on
                        QuillBot.
Command Data is distinct from Your Content, which includes
                        the contents of the email you prepare and receive, chat messages you write (excluding history or chats
                        received), documents you create, search queries, and text you enter in multiline fields on websites you visit.
                        We process Command Data in real time using our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs. After this
                        real-time processing, Your Content is deleted from our Services.
We also collect URLs and usage information (in addition to
                        the usage information described above), such as the number of times you disable/enable the extension on a
                        website. This information helps us understand how you use this service and how we can improve it.
We do not access your contacts, text in single-line fields
                        (which are more likely to contain personal data), or content in fields marked "sensitive," such as
                        credit card, password, email address, or email subject fields.
We only collect Your Content when the QuillBot icon is
                        displayed and enabled, indicating that Your Content will be grammar-checked or paraphrased. We only store Your
                        Content with your consent. You can disable the extension or revoke consent at any time by clicking the QuillBot
                        icon in the top-right corner of your browser and going to "Preferences."
We also collect URLs and usage information when you use
                        QuillBot on a website (in addition to the usage information described immediately above), such as the number of
                        times you disable/enable the extension on a website, which we retain to help us understand how you use this
                        Service and to help us improve it. We only collect Your Content when the QuillBot icon is displayed and enabled,
                        indicating that Your Content will be grammar checked or paraphrased. You can choose to disable the QuillBot
                        extension at any time on the top right corner of your browser. We do not access your contacts, text in
                        single-line input fields (which are more likely to contain personal data), or content in fields marked
                        "sensitive" such as credit card, password, email address or email subject fields.
Collected when you use the QuillBot Desktop App
When you install the QuillBot desktop app, QuillBot will
                        request permission to access your computer's accessibility features. This allows us to collect your
                        inputs from within certain applications on your computer to enable us to provide our Services to you. Your
                        inputs will be used in real time on our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs, after which they are
                        deleted. Access to your accessibility features also allow us to identify apps you use but which are yet to be
                        supported, so we can display a feedback widget. After you grant permissions to your computer's
                        accessibility settings, you can choose when to use the QuillBot desktop app to help improve your writing at any
                        time, by clicking on the QuillBot icon that appears when you open certain compatible apps on your computer.
Collected about you when you participate in QuillBot University

                        name, email address, occupation, country of residence, and any other personal data you provide to us. We may use this
                        personal data in order to process your registration, provide you with the event, and to improve our future events and
                        our services.

                        attribution and creating author profiles on QuillBot.

                        long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. In some cases, we retain personal

                        of personal information for a limited duration. For example, we keep account information like your account
                        email address for as long as your account is in existence, because we need it to operate your account.

Acceptable Use Policy,
where you can see that Fullstory has high standards regarding how our customers respect your privacy.

California
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), along with the California Privacy Rights Act amendment, provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of information about them, as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit sharing of Personal Information.

Privacy Notice for Californians
page.

Privacy Rights for Californians
Under the CCPA, California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes Californians' rights and explains how California residents can exercise those rights.
Below we further outline specific rights which California residents may have under the CCPA.
Right to Access Your Data.
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12- month period preceding the receipt of your request.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
Right to Data Portability.
You have the right to a "portable" copy of your Personal Information that you have submitted to us. Generally, this means you have a right to request that we move, copy or transmit your Personal Information stored on our servers or information technology environment to another service provider's servers or information technology environment.
Right to Delete Your Data.
You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
Right of correction
. You have the right to request correction or changes of your Personal Information if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date.
Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights.
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising your privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.
How to Submit a Request
You may submit a request to exercise your rights to know/access or delete your Personal Information through one of two means:
Submit a request via email to
privacy@fullstory.com
, or
Call 1-833-385-5786 to submit your request.
Upon submission of your request, we will contact you via the email address provided in your request.  To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information.  In some instances, such as a request for data deletion, we may first separately confirm that you would like for us to in fact delete your personal information before acting on your request.  With all requests, we will aim to complete requests as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with any timeframes mandated by applicable laws. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. You may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, or designate an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf through these means.
In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process Personal Information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.);
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;
Comply with a legal obligation; or
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

What are cookies and web beacons?
Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors to their websites. A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to our Website. Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. The cookies can be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies are stored by a web browser and remain valid until a set expiration date. Session cookies only exist while your internet browser is open and are automatically deleted once you close your browser.
Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic files contained on pages of websites that permit companies to count users who have visited certain webpages on a website and are used for other related website statistics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
