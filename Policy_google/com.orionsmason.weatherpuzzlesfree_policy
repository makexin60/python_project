LunaBeat Privacy Policy
We collect but do not link personal and activity data.
We use technologies like cookies (small files stored by your browser), web beacons, or unique device identifiers on our website to anonymously identify your
computer or device so we can deliver a better experience. Our systems also log information like your browser, operating system and IP address.
Our service does not currently recognize the 'Do Not Track' signal that may be available in some web browsers.
IOS & ANDROID USERS
We only collect anonymous information such as your type of device, its operating system, and your country of origin.
If you are using iTunes App Store, Google Play or Amazon App Store, they may collect and store data about your devices, time playing the game, and/or other personally identifiable information, but we do not have access to delete or modify this information.
GOOGLE PLAY USERS
We also may collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us, such as your postal/zip code, state and country of origin.
Developer's note: this data collection is due to Google Play's purchasing and record-keeping system. When you purchase an app, it displays identifiable information in our sales records (postal/zip code, state, country). We never share or sell this information.  We do not have access to delete or modify this information.
VIRTUAL REALITY USERS
We do not collect or store any anonymous or personally identifiable information through our games.  We only have access to sales records, which provide no statistical data.
If you are using Steam, VivePort, Oculus Home, or any other distribution service, they may collect and store data about your devices, time playing the game, and/or other personally identifiable information, but we do not have access to delete or modify this information.
It may be shown on your player profile page and any reviews you post.
Our systems are not designed to associate personal information with your activities (such as pages you view or things you click on or search for).
We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.
We do not store or share your precise location.
We do not use or collect your precise geographic location.
You can request to see your personal data.
You can contact us by email to request to see this personally identifiable information. This data is part of the sales records from Google Play and is not able to be deleted.
We may keep data indefinitely.
We don't share your personal data with other companies.
We do not share personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with other companies.
No ad companies collect data through our service.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, please contact us: mail@lauratallardy.com.
No analytics or third party vendors are used to track players within a game.  We do use an app sales statistic tracking service which formats information available to us through iTunes, which includes your country of origin and other anonymous statistical points.
We do not have access to modify or delete this information.
We take steps to protect personal information.
We take reasonable steps to secure your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access or disclosure. We encrypt transmission of data on pages where you provide payment information. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.
Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.
Special situations may require disclosure of your data.
To operate the service, we also may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, (3) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets. Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.
You can review more privacy-related information.

If we make any material changes to our policies, we will place a prominent notice on our website or application.
