2. Users
2.1 Information We Collect from Users (“User Information”)
We automatically collect User Information when Users interact with our Services that appear on our Customers’ websites and digital properties. Like most other web-based services, we collect this User Information through cookies and other technologies. Taboola collects only pseudonymized data, which means we do not know who you are because we do not know or process your name, email address, or other identifiable data. Instead, we only process digital identifiers such as cookie IDs, IP addresses, mobile advertising IDs on your device, Taboola network browsing history and associated preferences, and in some limited circumstances, your hashed email address.
User Information that we collect includes, but is not limited to the following:
Content Discovery Platform
: We collect Information about a User’s device and operating system, IP address, the web pages accessed by Users within our Customers’ websites, the link that led a User to a Customer’s website, the dates and times a User accesses a Customers’ website, event information (e.g., system crashes), Information about the interactions with advertisements and Customers’ Services (e.g., availability, visibility, and clicks), general location information (e.g., city and state), hashed email addresses (when made available by the User), and gender (when made available by the User).

Cookie Policy
.
Taboola Push Notification
: We collect Information about Users’ time zone, location (country, region, city), language, mobile operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), browser, connection and internet service provider.
2.2 Why We Use User Information
We use User Information for the following purposes:
Providing and Improving our Service
. We may use User Information to provide and improve our Services to Users and our Customers.
Tailoring content
. We may use User Information to tailor the content and information that we may send or display to Users; to retarget content to Users through our Services and elsewhere; and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using our Services. For more information about how we tailor our content see information below about our
Interest Based Advertising
.
Tailoring content across multiple devices
. We may use User Information to improve a unique User’s experience across multiple browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or other viewing devices) by providing better targeted ad campaigns to that User. For instance, should we recognize a User on a web browser, we may want to provide that User similar or personalized content on mobile apps, as well. To do this, we identify unique Users across devices, or we may sync cookies and identifiers with our service providers or Customers that do this, to help our Customers enhance their own data and data segments, or to help them target the right audience.
Offering our Customers data segments that help target content and advertisements for topics, products, and services that may interest you.
A data segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g., travel enthusiasts). We offer a number of data segments, both proprietary and from our
data partners
, to our Customers so that they may better target Users who are more likely to be interested in their content and advertisements. Taboola does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, Personal Data revealing your racial or ethnic origin or your religious affiliations, or Personal Data concerning your sensitive health information, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data). In connection with our Services, our Customers may use these
standard health-related segments
about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or over the counter medications. In addition, Taboola offers our Customers
standard political-related segments
that may indicate general political sentiment, interest in specific political issues, and political party affiliation.
2.3 To Whom We Disclose User Information
We may disclose User Information as follows:
Taboola Affiliates
. We may disclose User Information to any current or future Affiliates, parent companies, or subsidiaries to process for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Taboola service providers
. We may disclose User Information to vendors, service providers, agents, contractors, or others who perform functions (e.g., maintenance, data analysis, customer relationship management, email marketing, surveys, credit card processing, data hosting, or fraud detection) on our behalf.
Unaffiliated third parties
. We may disclose User Information to other unaffiliated third parties, specifically with (i) our
data partners
, so that we can connect you with relevant content by allowing our advertisers to target specific audience segments, and (ii) our
programmatic demand and supply partners
, so that we can serve you with tailored advertisements.
Customers
. We may disclose User Information to Customers where relevant to the Service we provide those Customers. For example, we may provide publishers with information about the viewing and click-through patterns of the content they publish and may provide advertisers with information about conversion rates for analytics purposes.

2.5 Interest-Based Advertising
Through our Services, including our Services on Customer websites, we may provide advertisements to you based on your recent browsing behavior across different Customer websites, browsers, or devices. For example, if on a first online visit, you browse on website A, then on a subsequent visit to website B, you may see content personalized based on your browsing history on website A. For example, if a user visits a clothing retail site, she might see clothing-related ads on another site she visits.
In order to target advertisements to you for products and services that may interest you, we may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other technologies. For more information about how we use these technologies, please refer to our
Cookie Policy
.
We may also work with third parties such as ad networks, which are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to websites that you have visited in the past. These advertisers will deliver you targeted advertisements for products and services that may interest you. Third-party ad networks, our advertiser Customers (and their content providers and agents), and/or traffic measurement services may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These
third-party cookies and other technologies
are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.
If you have questions about our collection and use of data for interest-based advertising purposes, please contact us at:
support@taboola.com
.
2.6 Opt Out
Taboola supports initiatives to offer our Users greater transparency and control over the uses of their Information. Therefore, we offer the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive.
If
you do not want to receive interest-based ads from Taboola, you can disable the display of such ads by clicking on the opt-out link below
. Please note that an opt out will not prevent you from seeing Taboola’s content recommendations. Rather, the opt out will prevent Taboola from using your Information to tailor these recommendations to your interests. You will continue to receive recommendations that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
You are currently:
Opted Out
Opt In
Not Opted Out
Opt Out
Not Opted Out
: Taboola will serve you personalized recommendations based on your history.
Opted Out
: You have opted out of tracking, Taboola will no longer serve you with personalized content recommendations based on your Internet use history.
Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices,
you will need to do so on each device and browser individually
. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies, your opt-out may not be effective, since we identify your choice to opt-out based on an opt-out cookie we deliver to you. In this case, you will need to confirm that your browser is configured properly in order for the opt-out to be effective. If you are using a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra, you must first adjust your Privacy and Security Settings to turn off both “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking” and “Block All Cookies”, and then return to this privacy policy or your preferred opt out platform to reset your opt out preferences.
Taboola may use non-cookie technologies in limited cases. Like cookies, these technologies allow Taboola to recommend ads that are tailored to your interests and to remember whether you have chosen to opt-out from our Services. Please note that some web browsers may not permit you to block the use of non-cookie technologies, but you can do so by simply clicking on the Opt Out feature above in this Section 2.6.
You can also opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by Taboola and other advertising companies
.
You may use the
NAI opt out tool
, which will allow you to opt out of receiving targeted ads from Taboola and from other NAI-approved member companies. The NAI also provides instructions to engage system-level mobile device opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments.
You may also visit one of the Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites to learn more about User choices and opting out of interest-based advertising displayed by the many member companies.
Users in the United States may visit the DAA consumer choice page at
www.aboutads.info/choices
Users in Canada may visit the DAAC consumer choice page at
www.youradchoices.ca/choices
Users in Europe (including the United Kingdom) may visit the EDAA consumer choice page at
www.youronlinechoices.eu
You can also opt out of the use of your email address for targeted ads through
Audience Matched Advertising
or AMA by Taboola and other advertising companies through the
NAI Audience Matched Advertising Opt Out (Beta)
.
Please note that an opt out from one or more companies listed on the DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages will not prevent you from seeing those companies’ advertisements. Rather, the opt out will prevent these companies from using your Information to display targeted content or ads to you. You may continue to receive advertisements that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will refuse opt-out cookies (that alert companies that you have exercised your opt-out preference).
2.7 Data Retention
We retain User Information, which is directly collected for purposes of serving ads, for at most thirteen (13) months from the User’s last interaction with our Services (often for a shorter period of time), after which time we de-identify the data by removing unique identifiers or aggregating the data.
We retain deidentified or aggregated data, which cannot identify an individual or device and is used for purposes of reporting and analysis, for as long as commercially necessary. We keep opt-out information for longer than this period so that we can continue to honor your opt-out requests.
2.8 Children
We do not knowingly collect any data or target any advertisements on websites directed to children under the age of eighteen (18). If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of eighteen (18) and have a concern regarding the Information we collect, please contact us at
dpo@taboola.com

.
3.2 Why We Use Site Visitor Information

Providing our Service

Tailoring content

3.4 Third-Party Online Advertising
To understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests, we may work with service providers or third parties that use their own
cookies, web beacons, and other technologies
to collect Information about Site Visitors’ online activities, either on our Sites and/or other websites across the Internet  (“
Taboola Ad Partners
”). These Taboola Ad Partners include advertisers and ad networks that may collect Information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different websites. Like most advertisers, Taboola works to place our advertisements where we think they will be most interesting and relevant to the recipient. One way we do this is by allowing ad networks to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites. This enables the ad network to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Taboola Sites. Then, if the ad network has purchased ad space on a third-party website, and recognizes that same individual visiting that third-party website, the ad network can deliver a Taboola advertisement, knowing that this individual has already expressed interest in Taboola by visiting the Taboola Sites. To learn more about third parties who collect Site Visitor Information, please review our
Cookie Policy
.
3.5 Site Visitor Choices
Site Visitors may opt out of the Taboola Ad Partners that collect information on the Sites to serve ads about Taboola. (Some U.S. Site Visitors may exercise their options directly with Taboola, as outlined below in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.3.1). By visiting one of the Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites, you can learn more about User choices and opting out of interest-based advertising displayed by the many member companies.
Users in the United States may visit the DAA consumer choice page at
www.aboutads.info/choices
Users in Canada may visit the DAAC consumer choice page at
www.youradchoices.ca/choices
Users in Europe (including the United Kingdom) may visit the EDAA consumer choice page at
www.youronlinechoices.eu
Please note that an opt out from one or more companies listed on the DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages will not prevent you from seeing those companies’ advertisements. Rather, the opt out will prevent these companies from using your Information to display targeted content or ads to you. You may continue to receive advertisements that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will refuse opt-out cookies (that alert companies that you have exercised your opt-out preference).

As part of Taboola’s global operations, our data flows among the EEA, the UK, Israel, the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong, and Taboola stores Customer, User, and Visitor information in our data centers located in Israel and the United States.
When Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to Taboola.com Ltd. in Israel, it relies (as applicable) on (i) the European Commission’s decision, and (ii) UK adequacy regulations that Israel provides a level of data protection that is adequate for EEA/UK Data. These allow the free transfer of EEA/UK Data to Israel without the need for additional data transfer mechanisms.
Similarly, when Taboola transfers any personal data from the EEA to Taboola Europe Limited in the United Kingdom, it relies on the European Commission’s decision that the UK provides a level of data protection that is adequate for personal data from the EEA.
Beyond that, when Taboola transfers EEA/UK Data to other countries then, if those countries do not have a European Commission adequacy finding and are not the subject of UK adequacy regulations (as applicable), Taboola implements
Standard Contractual Clauses
approved by the European Commission and/or competent UK authorities (as applicable) to protect the transferred data. The Standard Contractual Clauses are contractual privacy and security commitments that are entered between companies that transfer personal data outside of the EEA.
In particular, non-EEA/UK Taboola Affiliates, like Taboola, Inc. in the United States, have accordingly adopted Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure the legality, privacy, and security of the data flows necessary to provide, maintain, and develop our services.

Additionally, in the BoYuan News suite of tools, we collect in-app User behaviors (such as online status, browsing activity, and clicks) and implicit non-precise device location inferred from search queries (when enabled by the User).

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY
Cookies are small text files placed on a User’s device to store data that can be retrieved by the Site.

Therefore, the Controller uses cookies to store information or obtain access to information that had already been stored in the User’s end-use telecommunication equipment (a computer, a telephone, a tablet, etc.). The use of cookies within the Site is not aimed at identification of the User.
REQUIRED COOKIES
The Controller’s use of strictly necessary cookies is required for the proper functioning of the Site. The cookies are used specifically for the purposes of documenting and recalling login sessions and for purposes related to setting privacy options.

MARKETING COOKIES
Advertising cookies are used on the Site to tailor marketing to the User’s interests and to provide the User with more personalised service in the future. These cookies contain information regarding a User’s visits to the Site, and the Controller may share this information with third parties, such as advertisers. Advertising cookies may also be used by such third parties to build a profile of a User’s interests and to show relevant advertisements on other websites. If the User does not allow these cookies, they will experience less targeted advertising.
ANALYTICAL COOKIES
Analytical cookies allow for checking the number of visits and sources of traffic in the Service.

The timeframe for the processing of Personal Data may be extended if the processing is required to establish and to enforce any claims or to defend against any claims, and after such time, only in the event, and to the extent, that it is required by law.

To the extent that a User’s data is processed based on consent, such consent may be withdrawn at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent granted before its withdrawal.
A User has the right to object against the processing of their data for marketing purposes if the processing is done in connection with the legitimate interest of the Controller and – for reasons related to any special circumstances applicable to the User – in other cases when the legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest of the Controller (e.g. in connection with achieving analytical and statistical objectives).

regulatory or legal obligation to retain the personal data.
5.2 How long we keep your personal data
•
We may retain most of your personal data as long as needed to provide
          services or products to you, or as required or permitted by applicable
          laws.
•
When destroying personal data, measures will be taken to make the
          personal data irrecoverable or irreproducible, and electronic files
          which contain personal data will be deleted permanently using a
          technical method which makes the files irreproducible.
•
In the event that the processing and retention period have
          terminated, but personal data is required to be retained continuously
          for other reasons including but not limited to for the purposes as
          prescribed under applicable laws, the relevant personal data will be
          stored and maintained separately from other types of personal data. If
          you require us to destroy your personal data before the end of its
          life cycle (as set out in the retention policy above), we will destroy
          your personal data in accordance with local laws.
The Security of Your Personal Data
We are committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your
          personal data no matter where it is stored. Our group companies have
          information security and access policies that limit access to our
          systems and technology. We also protect data through the use of
          technological protection measures such as encryption. Your personal
          data will remain subject to our technical and organizational controls
          and our policies and procedures (including but not limited to this
          Privacy Policy).
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is
          not completely secure. Although we will use commercially reasonable
          efforts to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the
          security of the information transmitted to our services; any
          transmission of your information is at your own risk.
In the case of a personal data breach, we will notify the personal
          data breach to the supervisory authority competent, where feasible,
          not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the
          personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and
          freedoms of you.
When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to
          the rights and freedoms of you, we will communicate the personal data
          breach to you without undue delay.
Children
You hereby represent that you are an “adult” (as defined in the
          applicable in your jurisdiction) and have the requisite power and
          authority to access and/or use our Services. If you are not an adult,
          you must obtain the consent of your parent or legal guardian to use
          the Services. Usually our Services are not intended for children under
          the age of 16(this age requirement may vary in your country and is set
          forth in the table below) and we do not knowingly collect any personal
          data from such children. Children under the age of 16 should not use
          or attempt to use our Services, and if you are under 16, please do not
          attempt to use our Services.
In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered
          personal data from a child under the age of 16, we will take
          reasonable measures to delete such information from our records.
          Parents who believe that we might have gathered any information from
          or about a child under the age of 16 may submit a request to the email
          address set forth in the section “Contact Us” below.

Your Rights
8.1 The right to be informed
•
You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily
          understandable information about how we use your personal data and
          your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in
          this Policy.
8.2 The right of access
•
You have the right to obtain access to your personal data. This is so
          you are aware and can check that we are using your personal data in
          accordance with applicable data protection laws.
•
Please
contact us and submit a request to the email address set forth in the
          section “Contact Us” below.
8.3 The right to rectification
•
You are entitled to have your personal data rectified if they are
          inaccurate or incomplete. If you believe we hold any other personal
          data about you and that information is inaccurate, for information
          that you can change in your game settings, you can change it. And for
          information that you can't change, please contact our Email.
8.4 The right to erasure
•
This is
also known as
‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to
          request the deletion or removal of your personal data where there is
          no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not an absolute
          right to erasure and exceptions apply.
•
You may request that we erase the personal data we hold about you in
          the following circumstances:
￮
you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold such
          personal data; or
￮
you believe the personal data we hold about you is being unlawfully
          processed by us.
•
We may need to retain personal data if there are valid grounds under
          data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defense of legal
          claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is
          the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal data that
          has been made available publicly on the Services and there are grounds
          for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that
          are displaying the personal data or providing links to the personal
          data to erase it too.
•
You can also exercise your right to restrict our processing of your
          personal data (as described below) whilst we consider your
          request.
8.5 The right to restrict processing
•
You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal data
          we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain
          circumstances.
Please
note, however, that if we stop processing the personal data, we may
          use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for
          us to do so (e.g., for the defense of legal claims or for another’s
          protection). As above, where we agree to stop processing the personal
          data, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed
          the relevant personal data so that they can stop processing it
          too.
•
You may request we stop processing the personal data we hold about
          you where:
￮
you believe the personal data is not accurate for the period it takes
          for us to verify whether it is accurate;
￮
you wish to erase the personal data as the processing we are doing is
          unlawful but you want us to retain the personal data but just store it
          instead; or
￮
you wish to erase the personal data as it is no longer necessary for
          our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment,
          exercise or defense of legal claims.
8.6 The right to data portability
•
You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own
          purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to
          switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer
          your personal data easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and
          securely, without affecting its usability.
8.7 The right to object to processing
•
You have the right to object to certain types of processing,
          including processing for direct marketing (which we perform only with
          your consent).
8.8 The right to lodge a complaint
•
You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or
          process your personal data with your national data protection
          authority.
8.9 The right to withdraw consent
•
If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal
          data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time
          (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done
          with your personal data with your consent up to that point is
          unlawful). This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using
          your personal data for marketing purposes.
8.10 The right not to be subject to automated decision making
•
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on
          automated processing (including profiling) which produces legal (or
          similarly significant) effects to you.
•
We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge,
          but may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of
          providing the information for
：
baseless or excessive/repeated requests; or further copies of the
          same information. Alternatively, we may be entitled to refuse to act
          on the request.
•
Please
consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We will
          respond as soon as we practically can, generally within one month from
          when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take
          longer to deal with, we will come back to you and let you know.
•
We will also cooperate with the third-parties who have data
          interaction with us to ensure your rights pursuant to applicable laws
          and regulations.
Changes
If we make any material changes to this policy, we will post the
          updated policy here and notify our users.

          policy.
