Our position on privacy and data
We occupy a privileged space within the app and data ecosystems.
Transparency
We want to help people build positive products with our technology; we do not support fraud, invasion of privacy, or anonymity of access. We are open with our users in describing the information we do collect, and clear in how we use this information to improve our apps and services.
Data ownership
Being based in the UK, we are subject to some of the world's most stringent data protection laws. We believe our users’ data is theirs to control and we make deliberate decisions to protect a user’s privacy and data security in the design of our apps and services.
Security & safety
Our systems are designed to not diminish the security of the underlying app platforms we operate on and with. We support and encourage the use of two-factor authentication and tokenisation.
