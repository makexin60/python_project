Introduction
Instawork
created, develops, and maintains an online software and mobile platform on
which businesses (“
Partners
”) and
workers (“
Professionals
”) connect to
fill one-time and/or recurring work opportunities. When You (“
You
”) use our platform, including our
websites, mobile applications, content, and services (collectively our “
Services
”), You provide Your
information to us. Because we value Your privacy, this policy (our “
Privacy Policy
”) describes how we
collect, use, and disclose Your personal information.
Please carefully
read this Privacy Policy, which we incorporate into our Terms of Use (“
Terms
”), located at
https://instawork.com/legal/instawork-terms-of-use
. By accessing or using our Services in any capacity,
You
agree to our Terms and expressly authorize us to collect, receive, use, retain,
and disclose or transmit Your Information to third parties as described in this
Privacy Policy. Because You cannot access or use our Services without accepting
our Terms, if You have any questions, contact us at
privacy@instawork.com
or at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

What We Collect
Depending on
which Services You use and how You use them, Garuda Labs, Inc. dba Instawork
and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“
Instawork
,”
also referred to as “
we
,” “
us
,” and “
our
”) may collect different types of information from and about
You. We collect this information in three ways: 1) when You provide it directly
to us; 2) when we collect information generated through Your use of the
Services, and 3) from other sources.
2.1.
Information You Provide to Us
Partners and
Professionals use our Services to match available work opportunities with
available workers who possess a relevant skill set, and the information we
collect is intended to support this goal. To make these worker connections,
Partners and Professionals both must register for and maintain an active
Services account (a “
Registered Account
”).
For example, if You post a shift on behalf of a Partner or create a related
Registered Account, we may collect Your name, email address, and other
information about You and the Partner. Similarly, if You are a Professional, we
may collect Your name, email address, home address, and other information You
submit as part of the registration, profile creation, or shift-matching process
(including Your resume, name and contact information for Your references and
related data pertinent to using the Services). Specifically, we collect
information about You that You choose to provide to us in connection with Your
use of our Services, including information submitted when You:
●
Create or update Your Registered Account
(including creating and updating information on Your Professional or Partner
profile), which, depending on Your location and the Services You use, may
include Your name, email, social security number or social insurance number,
mobile device number, phone number, username and password, address, payment or
banking information, government identification numbers, birth date and
photographs. You may also choose to include Your race and/or ethnicity;
●
Request certain services or features through the
Services (such as through our mobile applications or websites, which may
include Your provision of health information);
●
Contact Instawork, including for support;
●
Contact other users (including Professionals,
references or Partners) through our Services;
●
Work shifts as a Professional through our
Services;
●
Post shifts as a Partner through our Services;
●
Complete surveys sent to You by Instawork or on
behalf of Instawork or otherwise participate in user research; or
●
Enable features that require Instawork’s access
to Your address book or calendar.
You may also provide us with information in
connection with a payment service (“
Payment
Service
”) offered to You as a convenience in association with the Services,
whereby You can maintain Your credit card or bank account information (each a “
Payment Account
”) securely with us in
connection with Your Registered Account, as defined above.
We also use third-party service(s) for identity
verification of Professionals. Such service(s) may collect information on our
behalf, such as facial geometry/facial mapping, that may
be
considered to be
a “biometric identifier,” “biometric information,” or
“biometric data” under certain laws. Our collection, use, and disclosure of
such biometric information is subject to the terms set forth in the notice
provided to You prior to the collection of this information.
2.2.
Information Created When You Use
The
Services
This includes:
●
Location Information:
Depending
on the Services You use and
Your
mobile application
settings or device permissions, Instawork may collect Your precise or
approximate location information, as determined through data such as GPS, IP
address, and
WiFi
. Instawork collects location
information when the mobile application is running in the foreground (mobile
application open and on-screen) of Your device. Instawork may collect this
information when the mobile application is running in the background of Your
device if this collection is enabled through Your application settings or
device permissions. You may use the mobile application without enabling
Instawork to collect Your location information. However, this may affect the
functionality of the mobile application, and You may not be able to use all
features of the Services. For example, to book a shift offered through our
Services,
You
must enable Instawork to collect Your
location information.
●
Transaction Information:
We collect
transaction details and information related to Your use of the Services,
including the types of Services You requested or provided (such as shift
requests), dates, times and durations of service engagements, engagement fees,
purchases made with an Instawork Debit Card (if You choose to use this service
through Instawork), and other related transaction details and information.
●
Usage Data and Preference Information:
We collect information about how You interact with our Services,
Your
preferences and settings chosen, and information about
the device and network You use to access the Services (“
Usage Data
”). In some
cases
we collect
Usage Data through the use of cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar
technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. A cookie is a piece
of data or text file on Your device that identifies You as a unique user. A web
beacon is an object that is embedded in a page or email and is usually
invisible to the user but allows checking whether a user has viewed the page or
email. We use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar technologies for
several purposes, including to improve the quality of the Services and to make
the Services easier to use. As more particularly described below in this
Privacy Policy, we sometimes use certain third-party tools and services to
assist us in collecting Usage Data. Certain of the third-party tools and
services use cookies or web beacons to help analyze how users use the Services.
We do not control these
third-parties
’ use of the
information they collect through these technologies. However,
You
may use the settings on Your browser/device to control
whether these cookies are placed on Your browser/device or alert You when they
are placed, in addition to the controls set forth in Section 8.1 of this
Privacy Policy.
●
Device Information:
We may collect
information about the devices You use to access our Services, including any
related Usage Data.
●
Log Information:
When You interact
with our Services, we collect server logs, which may include Usage Data and
information like device IP address, access dates and times, application
features or pages viewed, application crashes and other system activity,
browser type, and the third-party site or service You were using before
interacting with our Services.
●
Calls and Text Messages:
In addition to
our communications with Partners and Professionals, we enable users of our
Services to communicate with each other directly through communications
initiated by them through the Services. For example, we enable Partners and
Professionals to contact one another directly through the Services. Instawork
receives some information regarding such calls or texts, including the date and
time of the applicable call or text, and the content of the text messages.
Instawork may use this information for customer support services (including to
resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, and for
analytics. Additionally,
in order to
provide the
Services to You, Instawork will communicate with You with communications or
through its Alert Service, which includes contacting or messaging You by
telephone, email, short message service, in-app message, push notification, or
text message. Additionally, Instawork and its partners and affiliates may
contact You at any telephone number(s) You provide in connection with Your use
of the Services. By providing Your contact information, You consent to receive
communications (including communications containing an artificial voice or
prerecorded message or made using an automatic telephone dialing system) from
us, our affiliates and partners, and any Partner from which You are seeking a
shift, at any of the contact information You provided, including Your wireless
number, even if that number is registered on a corporate, state, or national
do-not-call registry.
●
Address Book and Calendar Information:
If
You permit Instawork or the Services (such as Instawork’s mobile applications)
to access the address book or contacts on Your device, we may collect names and
contact information (including phone numbers, phone labels, email addresses,
mailing addresses and birthdays) from Your address book to facilitate
interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this
Privacy Policy or at the time of consent or collection. If You permit the
Services (including Instawork’s mobile applications) to access the calendar on
Your device, we may collect calendar information such as event title and
description, Your response (Yes, No, Maybe), date and time, location, and
number of attendees. If You permit Instawork or the Services to access Your
address book or contacts on Your device,
You
expressly
represent and warrant that You have the right to allow Instawork to access Your
address book and contacts and that Instawork has the right to use Your address
book and contacts in connection with the Services.

Privacy Rights.
Residents of certain US states (including California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia)
and residents of Canada have certain rights in relation to their personal
information (as that term and similar terms, such as “personal data,” are
defined in applicable law). For example,
You
may have
the right to request that we:
●
Confirm whether we process personal
information about You;
●
Correct inaccurate personal
information we have about You;
●
Provide access to and/or a copy of
personal information we hold about You;
●
Delete personal information we have
about You;
●
Opt
out of the processing of Your personal information for
purposes of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or
similarly significant effects, if applicable;
●
California and Oregon residents can
also request information about the categories of personal information we
collect, disclose or sell or share about them; California residents can request
information about the sources of such information, the business or commercial
purpose for collecting or selling or sharing personal information and the
categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information. Such
information is also set forth in this Privacy Policy.
●
Oregon and Minnesota residents can
request a list of the specific third parties, other than natural persons, to
which we have disclosed personal information.
Residents of the
US states noted above also have opt-out rights, discussed further below. If You
are a California resident, please also see the section on “California
Residents” below for certain information specific to California residents.
Please note: Your
rights and our responses will vary based on your province, state or country of
residence. You may
be located in
a jurisdiction where
we are not obligated, or are unable, to fulfill a request. In such a case, your
request may not be fulfilled.
If You have such
a right depending on Your jurisdiction of residence, You may exercise Your
right by emailing us at
privacy@instawork.com
or
writing to us at Instawork, 548 Market St., PMB 63152, San Francisco, CA
94104-5401, Attention: Privacy.
We will take
reasonable steps to verify Your identity and requests, including by verifying
Your account information, residency or the email address you provide. If you
are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of another individual,
we may require proof of your written authorization before processing the
request. We do not currently have a method of verifying to a reasonable degree
of certainty the identity of users who do not have a Registered Account, as we
do not maintain enough personal information to enable us to verify such users.
Accordingly, we cannot honor the access or deletion requests of non-registered
users at this time.
Certain
information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law such as
information we retain for legal compliance and to secure our Services.
Applicable law may further provide You with the right to not be discriminated
against for exercising Your rights. If You have enabled a legally recognized
browser-based opt out preference signal (such as Global Privacy Control) on
your browser, we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent
required by applicable law.
Upon Your written
request, Instawork will remove any of Your personal information in its
possession and will cease using such personal information, subject to the terms
of this Privacy Policy and the Terms. You may request access to and removal of
such personal information by emailing us at
privacy@instawork.com
Please
note that in certain circumstances, Instawork may not be able to completely
remove all personal information about a particular user from its systems. For
example, Instawork may retain personal information about a user for legitimate
business purposes, if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for
account recovery purposes, if required by law, or as retained in Instawork’s
data backup systems or cached or archived pages. All retained personal
information will continue to be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to
which the user has previously agreed.
If You are a
resident of Virginia, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Colorado,
or Connecticut, and we deny Your personal information request,
You
have the right to appeal our denial. You can exercise
this right by emailing us at
privacy@instawork.com
or writing to us
at Instawork, 548 Market St., PMB 63152, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401,
Attention: Privacy. Your description must include Your full
name
and the email address used for Your account with us, along with a copy of the
denial notice You received from us.

Utah or Virginia resident,
You
may opt out of certain
processing of Your personal information, including for targeted advertising,
under applicable law.
We work with third-party partners to help us
better advertise our Services. These partners collect personal information via
cookies and similar technologies placed on our Services that allow them to
deliver ads that are more relevant to You and analyze Your interactions with
those ads. These cookies may
be considered to be
a
“sale” of personal information or “sharing” or “processing” of personal
information for “targeted advertising” purposes under state privacy laws. To
exercise Your rights to opt out of these cookie-based “sales” and
“sharing/processing,” please navigate to our website, scroll to the bottom of

information to third parties for these purposes, please email us at

Examples of these types of uses are discussed
above in Section 3. Disclosure and Use. We may also use the categories of

we may combine the information we collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of
information (“de-identify”) to prevent identification of any user or device. We
may also disclose this information to third parties for legal, compliance or
security purposes, or in connection with a business transfer, as described further
above. For more detail on our collection practices, including the types and
sources of information we receive, please review our Privacy Policy above,
specifically, “Information You Provide to Us,” (Section 2.1), “Information
Created When You Use
The
Services,” (Section 2.2), and
“Information From Other Sources,” (Section 2.3).
For information on how we use personal
information and to whom we disclose it, please review “Use and Disclosure”
(Section 2), and “Other Authorized Disclosures” (Section 3). We retain personal
information as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected
and processed, and for our legal compliance purposes.
In the 12 months leading up to the date of this
Privacy Policy, we have “sold” or “shared,” or “processed” for “targeted
advertising” purposes, the following categories of personal information: device
and online identifiers, and internet or other electronic network activity
information.
Sensitive Personal Information.
The
following personal information we collect is deemed “sensitive” under State
Privacy Laws.
●
Personal information deemed “sensitive” under
more than one State Privacy Law: precise geolocation data, and citizenship.
●
Personal information deemed “sensitive” only
under the CCPA: Social Security number; contents of certain communications
between users initiated through the Services (as covered in Section 2.2 above
under “Calls and Text Messages”); username and password.
We only use and disclose “sensitive” personal
information as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.
As noted above, our third-party identity
verification provider may also collect biometric information from Pros on our
behalf, and such information may
be considered to be
“sensitive” under State Privacy Laws. Instawork does not have access to this
biometric information.
9.2.
Your Choices Regarding
“Sharing” and “Selling”
You have the right to opt out of our
sale/sharing of Your
p
ersonal
i
nformation for purposes of targeted advertising and related
activities
through the use of
cookies and pixels by
clicking the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of our site. Please note
that You will need to exercise Your choice on each browser and each device you
use to access the Services. Also, if You have certain settings selected in your
browser (including pop-up blockers) you may need to re-configure those settings
to adjust Your settings. If You have a
legally-recognized
browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we
recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.
To opt out of the offline disclosure
of your information to third parties for these purposes, please email us at
privacy@instawork.com.
9.3.
Your CCPA Rights
Please see the "Your Rights and
Choices" section of our Privacy Policy above for information about the
additional rights You have with respect to Your personal information under
California law and how to exercise them.
If we ever offer any financial incentives in
exchange for Your personal information, we will provide You with appropriate
information about such incentives.
The CCPA also allows residents of the state of
California to limit the use or disclosure of their “sensitive personal
information” (as defined in the CCPA) if
Your
“sensitive personal information” is used for certain purposes. Please note that
we do not use or disclose “sensitive personal information” other than for
purposes for which California residents cannot exercise the right to limit
under the CCPA.
9.4.
Do-Not-Track
Disclosure
We are committed to providing You with
meaningful choices about the information collected on our Platform for
third-party purposes. That is why we have provided links (above) to the NAI
"Consumer Opt-Out" link, the DAA opt-out link, and a Google opt-out
link. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated
Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on
Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.
9.5.
California “Shine
the Light” Law Disclosure
California Law permits California residents to
request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal
information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third
parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a
request, please send written notice, by certified mail or Federal Express
(signature required), noting that You are making a “California Privacy Request”
to the following address:
Instawork

information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information”
includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social
Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted
either physically or online.
We do not engage in such activity;
however, if You are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or
services from us, You may submit a request to opt out of any potential future
sales under Nevada law by emailing us at

reasonable steps to verify Your identity and the authenticity of the request.

11.
Disclosures for Residents of
Canada
Instawork
is located in
the United States and some of its service providers (including affiliates
acting in this capacity) are located in the United States or elsewhere outside
of Canada. As a result,
Your
personal information will
be processed and stored outside of Canada for the purposes described in this
Privacy Policy. While outside of Canada, personal information will be subject
to applicable local laws, which may permit government and national security
authorities in those jurisdictions to access Your personal information in
certain circumstances.
You may request access to or correction of Your
personal information, or withdraw consent to our collection, use or disclosure
of Your personal information (as defined in relevant laws), by writing to
privacy@instawork.com
. These rights are subject to applicable contractual and legal
restrictions and reasonable notice. We may take reasonable steps to verify Your
identity before honoring any such requests.
We may use services provided by third-party
platforms (such as social media and other websites) to serve targeted
advertisements on such platforms to You or others, and we may provide a hashed
version of Your email address or other information to the platform provider for
such purposes. To opt-out of the use of Your information for such purposes,
please send a request using any of the methods set forth below.‍
We have record retention processes designed to
retain personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes set
out herein or as otherwise required to meet legal or business requirements.
If You have any questions or comments about this
Privacy Policy or the
manner in which
we or our
service providers (including our service providers outside Canada) treat Your
personal information, or to exercise any rights in respect of Your personal
information, please contact our Privacy Officer using the contact information
set out below.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
