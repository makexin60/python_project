Device data
,
such as your computer or mobile device’s operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.

Cookies and similar technologies
. Some of the automatic collection described above is facilitated by the following technologies:
Cookies
, which are small text files that websites store on User devices and that allow web servers to record Users’ web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites include both “session cookies” that are deleted when a session ends, “persistent cookies” that remain longer, “first party” cookies that we place and “third party” cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place.
Local storage technologies
, like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
Web beacons
, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. Certain sections of our Services and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count Users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (e.g., recording the popularity of a certain section and verifying system and server integrity, responses to marketing, etc.).
Session-replay technologies
, such as those provided by LogRocket, that employ software code to record Users’ interactions with the Services in a manner that allows us to watch DVR-like replays of those User sessions. The replays include Users’ clicks, mobile app touches, mouse movements, scrolls and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions.  These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement.  You can learn more about LogRocket at

CCPA Consumer Request Metrics
1. Who we are
One of the primary ways Bombora collects data is from a proprietary data cooperative (“Data Co-op”). The Data Co-op consists of business to business (“B2B”) websites of publishers, marketers, agencies, technology providers, and research and event firms that contribute content consumption data to a massive pooled data set that details the buying intent of a company.
Co-op members provide consent-based brand-anonymous data, including
Unique IDs
(including Cookie IDs), IP address, page URL and referrer URL, browser type, operating system, browser language, and engagement data (including dwell time, scroll velocity, scroll depth and time between scrolls) (collectively, “Event Data”). Engagement data validates You are actually consuming content and not quickly bouncing from the website. The full data set is refreshed weekly.
Bombora collects the Event Data, analyses the content You consumed on the website, and assigns the content topics using the Bombora topic taxonomy (“Topics”).
When Bombora is able to identify from Your Event Data which company You represent (“Company Name/URL”), Bombora aggregates the Topics and Company Name/URL to a company profile, including all events of other employees from the same Company Name/URL.
The tag collects your actions but the actions are assigned to a company.
Bombora provides the following hosted platform and related analytics products (collectively the “Services”) to its clients (“Subscribers”):
Services
1.1 Company Surge® Analytics
An analytics report listing company name, topic and
Company Surge®
score. To create the score Bombora collects, stores, organizes, uses and erases data which is anonymized and aggregated such that no personal data exists. Bombora will not disclose any data to a company other than company name, topics searched, and Company Surge® score. These reports are created by collecting data from tags on publisher websites. The Bombora Tag (defined below) collects IP address (which is anonymous and converted to company URL), engagement metrics, and topics (which are determined by real time algorithm). The topics (based on Bombora’s B2B taxonomy) are attributed to company name. Our proprietary algorithm compares topic interest over 30 Billion interactions to create a score. That score is the company’s interest level in the topics, compared over time.
1.2 Audience Solutions
Audience Solutions
is a data product that supports the process of digital ad buying or ad targeting by our customers.  Audience Solutions and Measurement Products append data to, and share, a Cookie ID.  Bombora appends firmographic and demographic data to the Cookie ID, only at the domain (name of website) and at the company level.
The firmographic and demographic data may include industry, functional area, professional group, company revenue, company size, seniority, decision maker and predictive signals. Bombora does not share any data which could be used to identify You, an individual data subject.
Facebook integration
: As fully described in ‘
‘what we do and collect and why’
, through the Bombora integration with Facebook, Bombora uploads audiences derived from hashed emails associated with domains into Facebook. Facebook matches these hashed emails against their database of users to create a custom audience for targeting.
LinkedIn integration
: Through the LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform API, Bombora sends Company Surge® Intent data as a list of domains (e.g., companyx.com) into LinkedIn. LinkedIn matches its users to domains to create a matched audience for targeting within the LinkedIn Ad Platform.
1.3 Measurement Products
The following
Measurement
suite of products collect demographic and firmographic information. The Bombora Tag is (Bombora term) a JavaScript or pixel tag placed on the websites of Subscribers which collects data from each device which visits the Subscriber’s websites including (1) placement and synchronization of unique identifiers, such as cookie ID or hashed email; (2) IP address and information derived therefrom, such as city and state, company name, or domain name; (3) engagement level data, such as dwell time, scroll depth, scroll velocity, and time between scrolls; (4) page URL and information derived therefrom such as content, context and topics; (5) referrer URL; (6) browser type and (7) operating system (collectively the “Bombora Tag”). Each of the products in the measurement suite uses information collected from the Bombora Tag in different ways to provide subscribers with an end product.
Audience Verification:
With our
Audience Verification
product, a Subscriber places a tag on their campaign creative. The audience verification tag is able to collect the following data insights when You click the advertisement: Unique IDs (including Cookie IDs), IP address and information derived such as geography, User agent, browser type and operating system (OS).
Visitor Insights:
With our
Visitor Insights
product, a Subscriber places a tag on their website. (We also have placed the Bombora  Tag on our Websites). The visitor insights tag collects insights about website visitors, including but not limited to the following data: (i) overall visitor engagement segmented by high, medium, and low percentages; (ii) overall visitor engagement compared to previous date ranges; (iii) total companies, unique users, sessions and page views; (iv) total companies, unique users, sessions and page views compared to previous date ranges; (v) engagement by company domain segmented by high, medium, and low and (vi) unique users, sessions, and page views by company domain. This data can be delivered through the Bombora user interface, from a daily feed, or directly from the Google Analytics platform.
Visitor Track
:
Visitor Track
is used along with certain software tools, such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information. We do this in order to analyze traffic to our Website, and to better understand the needs of our customers and visitors. Some examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (“IP”) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) referring page to our Website along with each page viewed, including date and time.
Through the Services, Bombora provides data to our Subscriber to help them better connect and target organizations they want to reach (we refer to the individuals in those organizations as “End Users”). Bombora and its partners engage in tracking End Users’ interactions with business-to-business content across various digital properties like web registration forms, widgets, websites and webpages (whether accesses via computer, mobile or tablet device or other technologies) (“Digital Properties”). We then take this data and aggregate the information collected into demographic segments, such as company revenue and size, functional area, industry, professional group, and seniority. This helps Subscribers customize engagement based on topics that organizations are interested in and the intensity of their consumption

2. Privacy for our services
This section describes how we collect and use information we receive or collect from End Users through our Services (we refer to this collectively as “
Service Information
“). This includes details about the type of information we collect automatically, the types of information we receive from other sources and the purposes of those collections.
2.1 What information do we collect and why?
Information we collect automatically:
We use and deploy various cookies and similar tracking technologies (see
‘cookies and similar technologies’
) to automatically collect certain information about your device when you interact with Digital Properties that use our technology. Some of this information, including your IP address and certain unique identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device and may be considered “personal data” in certain jurisdictions including in the European Economic Area (“
EEA
“) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). However, for its Services
For the services that we provide, Bombora does not collect any information that we reverse engineer to enable us to identify you personally such as your name, mailing address or email address
. The information we collect is not used to identify you as an individual.
We collect this information by assigning a random unique identifier (“
UID
“) to your device the first time you interact with a Digital Property that uses our technology. This UID is then used to associate you with information we collect about you.
The information we automatically collect may include:
Information about your device
such as the type, model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address and unique identifiers assigned to your device such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID).
Information about your online behavior
such as information about the activities or actions you take on Digital Properties we work with. This may include time spent on a web page, whether you scroll or click on an ad or a web page, session start/stop time, time zone, your referring website address, and geo-location (including city, metro area, country, zip code and potentially geographic co-ordinates if you have enabled location services on your device) pages and times visited.
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on
such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it and the number of times you have seen the ad.
When you use Zoom or Gong, the information we collect may include:
log information (time and date stamp)
IP address
Business email
Information we receive from other sources
We may also combine, merge, and/or enhance the information we collect about you (collectively “Service Information’). This can include the information we collect about you with information collected from third parties such as other web-based and mobile networks, exchanges and websites (“
Partners
“) or our Subscribers (for example, they may upload certain “offline” data into the Services). Here is a list of
our current partners
. In addition, the Service Information we automatically collect may be combined and associated with business profile information that we infer about you, such as: age, domain, functional area, household income, income status and changes, language, seniority, education, manufacturing, professional group, industry, company revenue, and net-worth.
This information may include hashed identifiers derived from other information such as email addresses, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data (like your industry, employer, company size, job title or department) and content viewed, or actions taken on a Digital Property.
We use the Services Information as follows:
To provide the services to our Subscribers
. Generally, we use the Service Information to help Subscribers better understand their current and prospective customers and market trends. This enables Subscribers to better target and customize websites, content, other general marketing efforts and to measure and optimize the performance of their marketing.
To build various inferenced data segments
(“
Data Segments
”)
.
We may use the Service Information to build Data Segments related to, for instance, the industry you are in or the type of content you or the organization you work for appear to be interested in. We use these Data Segments to help our Subscribers understand their own customers, evaluate customer and market trends and create reports and scoring regarding their customer’s behavior. The Data Segments also may be associated with UIDs, cookies and/or mobile device advertising IDs.
To do “interest-based advertising”.
We sometimes use or work with Subscribers and Partners that use UIDs or other information derived from information such as email hashes. This information in turn may be associated with cookies and may be used to target ads to you that are based on “offline” interest-based segments – such as your interests, transactions or demographic information – or used by Subscribers that target and analyze such ads. This is often known as “interest-based advertising.” You can find out more about this type of advertising at the
DAA’s website
.
To do cross-device tracking.
We (or our Partners and Subscribers we work with) may use the Service Information (e.g. the IP addresses and UIDs) to try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets or other devices), or work with providers that do this in order to better target ad campaigns to common sets of End Users. For example, a brand may wish to target customers that it usually recognizes on web browsers through mobile apps.
To do “user matching”:
We (or our Partners) may use the Services Information, in particular various UIDs, to sync cookies and other identifiers with other Partners and Subscribers (i.e. to do “
user matching
“). For example, in addition to the UID’s an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of UIDs our Partners or Subscribers have assigned to an End User. When we identify matches, we then let our Subscribers and Partners know in order to help them do any of the above, including enhancing their own data and Data Segments to do interest-based advertising or provide insights to other customers. For instance, we use
Facebook Custom Audiences
to match users.
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate
under applicable law including laws outside your country of residence:
to comply with legal processes

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
’ below), we will honor this request, unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, such as billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
Depending on the data protection laws applicable to you, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal data that we process as a data controller:

You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.

Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.

How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.

Twilio Product Privacy
Twilio offers a range of industry-leading communications and customer data platform services to our customers. Depending on the Service, Twilio may be a data controller and data processor of personal data used to provide the Services.
Twilio processes personal data (Communications Usage Data and Customer Content) for most of our Services as a data processor acting on the instruction of our customer and in accordance with the terms of our agreement with a customer, our
Data Protection Addendum
, and service specific terms. Our Services provide customers with ways to control, access and secure their data.
We also offer customers the ability to store, delete, access, or exercise other choices about their personal data. The ability to make these choices depends on the Service being used and how it is being used by a customer. Customers are referred to our
API docs
for each of our Services, along with SendGrid’s

Authy
The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.

“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services.

Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”

You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center

During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers
To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them.

Please review your merchant’s, bank’s, and payment method provider’s privacy policies for more information about how they use and share your Personal Data.
Financial services
. Certain Business Users leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via Stripe or our Financial Partners. For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User.

What we do
How does Stripe protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse we use security measures to comply with federal law.  These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.  We impose access controls along with ongoing monitoring to prevent data misuse, and we require our service providers to take similar steps to protect your information.
How does Stripe collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
• open a Link account;
• ask Stripe to process a payment for goods or services;
• provide bank account information to Stripe using Financial Connections
We also collect your personal information from others, such as affiliates or other companies.
Why can’t I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
• sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
• affiliates from using your information to market to you
• sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you.
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See the Other Important Information section below for more information on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.
