Children’s Privacy
Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected such information, we will delete it promptly.
Technical Data Collection and Usage in Our Apps
To ensure that our Apps can operate properly and provide you with the features you want, the provider of your mobile device may collect certain Technical Data. The data is automatically collected and transmitted to us from your device during your use of the Apps (“Usage Data”) and includes:
• Device name (e.g., “Apple iPhone” or “Samsung Galaxy” or any other name that you have given your device)
• Operating system and version
• System language
• General device data, such as voice and regional settings
• IP address of the device
• Date and time of use
• Application ID to identify your installation of the App
Our Apps may send us (or our IT suppliers) an error message in the event of a crash or other error (e.g., after the App has unexpectedly quit because of a program error or has stopped responding to your input). The error message contains Technical Data and information about which part of the App’s software code has caused the error. This information helps us understand the cause of the error so that we can develop a fix to prevent that error from reoccurring and therefore improve the App for all users.
When you open the Apps for the first time, you may be asked for permission to send you push notifications. If you allow this feature, our Apps will send you push notifications, for example, reminders, alerts, updates, and other information. You can configure and turn off push notifications via your device settings at any time. You can also select the exact notifications you would like to receive using the in-app settings or browser settings. If you permit location settings, you will be asked if the App is allowed to access your location. If you allow this feature, we will determine your location to provide you with site-specific functions, like showing you which of our locations are close to you. You can configure and turn location settings off via your device settings at any time.
If certain features require access to your camera or microphone, or photo and videos, or your phone contacts, you will be asked if you want to use this function and provide such access before using it for the first time. You can enable or disable access to these functions at any time via your device settings.
It is in our legitimate interest to use the Usage Data and send error messages (if applicable) in such a way in order to secure our Apps and to detect and resolve errors and cyberattacks. We rely on consent where you have enabled features such as push notifications, location, camera, microphone, or photo and video upload functions, as it will be your choice to receive such notification or allow us access to this information.
Retargeting through Cookies
We and our third-party partners use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and other similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Cookies”) to collect data from the devices you use to access our Site, Products, and Services, as well as any emails you receive from us. The collected data includes Behavioral Data, Technical Data, and certain Profile Data. For more information, including details about our third-party partners, please see our Cookie Policy.
We and our third-party partners use this data to analyze how you use our Site and our Products and Services and the effectiveness of our Site and our Products and Services.
In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to certain websites administered by us or on our behalf. We may track click-through data to assist in determining interest in our communications and measuring the effectiveness of our outreach.
Where your data is collected through the use of non-essential cookies, we rely on consent to collect your personal data and for the onward processing purpose. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details.
In certain circumstances, we may rely on another lawful basis when we use your personal data collected via the use of cookies. For example, where we use personal data collected through the use of analytics cookies to analyze how you use our Site, it is in our legitimate interest to use your personal data in such a way to improve our Site and our Products and Services.
If You Fail to Provide Your Personal Data
If we are required by law to collect your personal data, or we need to collect it under the terms of a contract with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. This situation may arise if you do not provide the personal data needed to deliver the Products and Services you have requested or to process an application to register an account. In such circumstances, we may have to cancel your application or cease providing the relevant Products and Services to you.
Third-Party Links and Services
This Privacy Notice applies only to personal data processed by us through your use of our Site and in connection with our business operations. However, our Site may occasionally contain links to third-party websites and services. We have no control over these websites and services, and this Privacy Notice does not apply to your interactions with these third parties.
