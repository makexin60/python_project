We do not normally go corporate, but when it’s about our users, we make the solemn vow to take care of your personal data till the last day, like a king protects his kingdom from creeps.

Personal information can be any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. In other words, it can be any information that could allow us to identify you both directly and indirectly (like for example your name, email address or billing address). In this policy, we will sometimes use the words “personal information” and sometimes the words “personal data” or simply “data” to refer to your personal information.
This policy applies to all Raw Fury products (“Product(s)”), such as Raw Fury owned websites, as well as other interactions through email communication, customer support, offline interactions at conventions, information about your technical equipment such as your hardware and software type, location data, and other information you provide us with, for example when you sign up for our surveys and contests or play some of our games.
This Policy explains which personal information we collect from you, for what reasons, how we use, store and transfer such information but also how you can contact us to ask about your data and invoke your rights.
We only collect, use, store and transfer (“process“) your personal information in accordance with applicable data protection legislation, including but not limited to the (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) (“GDPR“) and applicable national data protection legislation (hereafter “applicable law“).

Please note that our Products sometimes run in stores and applications of third parties (like for example, Steam) whose privacy practices differ from Raw Fury. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties or their products, your data is governed by these third parties’ privacy statements. For example, if you play a VR version of one of our games (such as, Townscaper), Meta will collect data from you in accordance with the terms of their privacy policy. If you play Superfuse, we recommend that you read the privacy statement available in the game.
When you play the game “Bad North” in particular:
In addition to the above listed data collected in any of our games, we will collect your IP address and instance ID solely as part of the Firebase Crash Reporting process, in order to measure the number of users impacted by any specific crash in the game and to help us debug such crashes.

When we run marketing activities
:
Through third party services like Facebook, Twitter, Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager, we collect page usage (e.g. buttons clicked, screens viewed, time spent, etc.), general demographics (language, country, city, age range, gender, interest categories), device usage and operating system.  We use such data to deliver and personalize our communications with you and provide the most relevant advertising to you. Raw Fury may work with third party advertisers that utilize cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant advertising about Raw Fury Products on our website and across the Internet. To provide this “interest-based advertising”, these parties combine non-personal data learned about your online activities over time which helps ensure that your advertisement is customized to you. Examples of this include a display of a Raw Fury advertisement on a Facebook page, on a Google-owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within Google’s advertising network. We do not share your personal information as part of this process. You can opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. Electing to opt out may make the ads you see on the internet less relevant to you. If you have opted out of receiving communications from us, we will not use your email address in this for interest-based advertising, although you may still be subject to certain interest-based advertising depending upon your browser and device settings.
Legal Grounds for processing your data
We will only use and process personal information from you for one of the following reasons:
to fulfil a contract we have with you (for example, when you purchase a game); when it is our legal duty (for example, to identify your age and make sure we are not collecting data from young children);
when you consent to it (for example, when subscribing to our newsletter); or
when it is in our legitimate interest (for example, to enforce our policies, to manage our everyday business, to ensure information security, to prevent fraud or to transfer the data to different part of the organization when necessary).
Sharing and Disclosure
Raw Fury does not and will not sell personal information from our users. We only disclose your data strictly as stated in this policy. We may only share information with the types of third parties described below and always ensure, when sharing information, that such third parties adhere to the same principles.
To Whom We Disclose your Personal Information and Why
Third Party Vendors who perform services such as website management and hosting, shipping, customer support applications or email communications (like for example, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, TeamTailor and Discord). In such instances, your personal information will be shared with these agents, contractors or partners but only for the purpose of performing services on behalf of Raw Fury and in accordance with this policy. The updated list of these parties may be requested from Raw Fury at any time.
Parties with whom it might be necessary when required by law or in connection with legal proceedings; to prevent harm to Raw Fury or its customers; for the prevention and detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders; to protect the rights or property of Raw Fury.
Parties with whom it might be necessary to complete a financial or corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
We may also share non-personal information such as aggregated data with our investors, partners or publicly. For example, we may inform a game service about how their users have utilized Raw Fury Products on their platform, or we may share the total sales of a Raw Fury Product or share overall game statistics with our audience.
