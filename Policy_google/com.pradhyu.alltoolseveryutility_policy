                    share the real time data with the connected device of your choice and the data will never be stored

Location data is required for the tools like Speedometer, altimeter, my location, path tracker, for
                    finding
                    near by devices to connect wifi and wifi tools.
For Speedometer, Compass and Altimeter the location is taken only when the app is ON and when is in
                    use to
                    show you the values in graphical way. No location data is collected or stored in device or remote

                    all the
                    data in the app itself when ever you want,
                    location data will be collected and stored in device itself in background using foreground service
                    so a
                    notification will be shown always or anytime till the app is running to stop the tool, service and
                    to stop
                    collection of location data. for this path tracker tool background location is needed because it
                    should
                    trace out the path even when the app is locked (Ex: After parking your car and turning on "path
                    tracker"
                    tool it will start collecting location data even when you lock and keep in pocket so it will show
                    where the
                    car is parked when you see the path).

                    phones
                    and WiFi Calls uses location to be turned ON to scan and connect to a WiFi network or peer to peer
                    using
