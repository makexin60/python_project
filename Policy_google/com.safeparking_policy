Data Portability
In certain circumstances, you shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller.

Object to Automated Decision-Making
In certain circumstances, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you. However, Copart does not utilize automated decision-making in the processing of your Personal Data.
Withdraw Consent
