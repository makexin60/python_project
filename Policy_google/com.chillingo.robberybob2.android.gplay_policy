Use of Cookies
Cookies are used to enhance the user-friendliness of websites. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your terminal device. Your browser accesses these files. The use of cookies improves the user-friendliness and security of our websites. Many browsers offer the setting option not to allow cookies or at least limit their use. However, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our websites.
A distinction is made between session and permanent cookies. A cookie is used to store information that is related to the specific device used. However, this does not mean that we are immediately aware of your identity. The use of cookies serves to make the use of our websites more pleasant for you.
We use so-called session cookies to recognize that you have already visited individual pages of our websites. These will be deleted automatically after leaving our sites.
In addition, we also use temporary cookies to optimize the user experience, which are stored on your device for a specified period of time. If you visit our websites again, it is automatically recognized that you have already been here and which entries and settings you have made, so that you do not have to enter them again.
Furthermore, we use cookies to collect statistical data regarding the usage of our websites and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimizing our offer for you (see para. 7). These cookies allow us to automatically recognize that you have already been with us when you visit our site again. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined time. The data processed by cookies are for the aforementioned purposes for the protection of our legitimate interests as well as the third party under Art. 6 (1) lit. f of GDPR required.
Tracking and Analysis Tools
The use of tracking measures on our websites is to ensure the appropriate design and continuous optimization of our websites. Tracking is also used to gather statistics about the use of our websites and evaluate the data for the purpose of optimizing our offerings for you. These are to be considered justified interests. The data processing purposes and data categories are to be taken in each case from the corresponding tracking tools. The tracking-tools used by Deca and listed below are carried out on the legal basis of Article 6 (1) lit. f of GDPR.
Google Analytics
Our websites use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“
Google
”). In order to increase efficiency, to tailor the design and to continuously optimize the Services, we create pseudonymous user profiles with the help of Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files stored on your computer to help the websites analyze how visitors use the websites. The information generated by the cookies about your use of our websites is usually transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA. Google uses this information, on behalf of the operator of our websites, for the purpose of evaluating your use of our websites, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage for the website operator.
In the event of the activation of IP anonymization on our websites, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contractual states of the treaty on the European Economic Area. This shortening eliminates the personal reference of your IP address. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a server of Google in the USA and truncated there. IP anonymization is active on our websites.
The IP address transmitted to us by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be combined with any other data held by Google. You may prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software. However, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our websites. You can also prevent the recording of data generated by the cookies about your use of the websites (including your IP address) by Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the plug-in available at the following link:  http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).
As an alternative to the browser add-on or from browsers on mobile devices, please click the following link to block recording by Google Analytics on respective website in the future: Deactivate Google Analytics. This will place an opt-out cookie on your device. If you delete your cookies, you will need to click the link again. Detailed information regarding data use by Google Inc. is available here:

Third Party Service Providers
We may share your personal data with our third-party service providers who provide services such as data analysis, payment processing, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other similar services. These third parties are only permitted to use your personal data to the extent necessary to enable them to provide their services to us. They are required to follow our express instructions and to comply with appropriate security measures to protect your personal data. Our main service providers are currently: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Zendesk, Splunk, DataDog, Suraway Ltd., Unity Technologies.
Third Party Advertisers
We may share personal data with advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. We currently share your device ID and device advertising ID with the following companies for the purpose of personalising the ads that you see: Vungle, AppLovin, AdColony, Fyber, Unity Ads, Google AppsFlyer, Kochava, AdMob, Appodeal, MoPub, Facebook Audience Network, myTarget, Adjust, Tapjoy, SuperRewards and ironSource.
Social Media Plug-ins
Our websites use social plug-ins of the social networks Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube to enhance our company's profile
on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). The underlying commercial purpose is to be considered a legitimate interest. The responsibility for operation in compliance with data protection regulations lies with the provider in each case. We include these plug-ins via the so-called two-click method to provide the users of our website with the best possible protection.
Facebook Social Plug-ins
Our websites use social plug-ins of the social network Facebook which is run by Facebook Inc., (1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA). The plug-ins can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white "f" on blue square or with a "thumbs-up" icon). The list and appearance of all the Facebook plug-ins can be seen here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
If you open our websites using that plug-in, the browser will establish a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook servers. The plug-in informs Facebook Inc. that a user has opened the respective website of the offer. There is a possibility that your IP address gets stored. If you are logged in with Facebook, Facebook can match such a site visit to the respective Facebook account. If you post a comment or click the like button the respective information is directly transmitted from your browser to Facebook and will be stored there. Deca thus does not have any influence on the nature and amount of data transferred by the plug-in to Facebook Inc. This data transfer is independent of a click by the user. You can find further information here: https://www.facebook.com/help/186325668085084.
In addition to this information you should also note Facebook's data protection regulations. Purpose and scope of the data collection and the further use of such data by Facebook as well as the respective rights and configuration options for protecting the user’s sphere of privacy can be taken from Facebook’s data protection notice https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. Further, there is the possibility to install an add-on which will block the Facebook plug-in and prevent the data transfer.
If you are a registered member of Facebook and would like to prevent Facebook from collecting data about you via this offer and matching that data with your member data stored with Facebook, you should log out of Facebook before visiting the respective website.
Twitter
Further, some of our websites use the Twitter buttons. Such plug-ins are run by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Ste. 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. They can be recognized by the terms "Twitter" or "Follow" combined with a stylized bird. Thanks to this button it is possible to share a post or a website of this offer on Twitter or to follow Deca on Twitter. If you open the respective website containing such a button, your browser will establish a direct connection with the Twitter servers. The contents of the Twitter button will be transmitted directly by Twitter to your browser. Deca does not have any influence on the amount of data collected by Twitter with such plug-ins and we herewith inform you in accordance with our knowledge. According to Twitter Inc. only the user’s IP address is transmitted and collected when retrieving the button. Further information can be taken from Twitter’s data protection notice at
http://twitter.com/privacy
. However, please note that you have the option of changing your data protection settings on Twitter in your Twitter account settings at
http://twitter.com/account/settings
.
YouTube
Some of our websites also include a YouTube plug-in belonging to Google Inc., headquartered in San Bruno/California, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. As soon as you visit a website with a YouTube plug-in, a connection is set up to the YouTube servers. As part of this process the YouTube server is informed of the particular pages on our websites that you visited. If you are also logged in to your YouTube account, you would enable YouTube to assign your browsing habits directly to your personal profile.
You can prevent this assignment by logging out of your YouTube account beforehand. For more information on how YouTube collects and uses your data see the data protection policy at
https://www.youtube.com

Our websites use social plug-ins of the social network Facebook which is run by Facebook Inc., (1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA). The plug-ins can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white "f" on blue square or with a "thumbs-up" icon). The list and appearance of all the Facebook plug-ins can be seen here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
If you open our websites using that plug-in, the browser will establish a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook servers. The plug-in informs Facebook Inc. that a user has opened the respective website of the offer. There is a possibility that your IP address gets stored. If you are logged in with Facebook, Facebook can match such a site visit to the respective Facebook account. If you post a comment or click the like button the respective information is directly transmitted from your browser to Facebook and will be stored there. Deca thus does not have any influence on the nature and amount of data transferred by the plug-in to Facebook Inc. This data transfer is independent of a click by the user. You can find further information here: https://www.facebook.com/help/186325668085084.
In addition to this information you should also note Facebook's data protection regulations. Purpose and scope of the data collection and the further use of such data by Facebook as well as the respective rights and configuration options for protecting the user’s sphere of privacy can be taken from Facebook’s data protection notice https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. Further, there is the possibility to install an add-on which will block the Facebook plug-in and prevent the data transfer.
If you are a registered member of Facebook and would like to prevent Facebook from collecting data about you via this offer and matching that data with your member data stored with Facebook, you should log out of Facebook before visiting the respective website.
Twitter
Further, some of our websites use the Twitter buttons. Such plug-ins are run by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Ste. 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. They can be recognized by the terms "Twitter" or "Follow" combined with a stylized bird. Thanks to this button it is possible to share a post or a website of this offer on Twitter or to follow Deca on Twitter. If you open the respective website containing such a button, your browser will establish a direct connection with the Twitter servers. The contents of the Twitter button will be transmitted directly by Twitter to your browser. Deca does not have any influence on the amount of data collected by Twitter with such plug-ins and we herewith inform you in accordance with our knowledge. According to Twitter Inc. only the user’s IP address is transmitted and collected when retrieving the button. Further information can be taken from Twitter’s data protection notice at
http://twitter.com/privacy
. However, please note that you have the option of changing your data protection settings on Twitter in your Twitter account settings at
http://twitter.com/account/settings
.
YouTube
Some of our websites also include a YouTube plug-in belonging to Google Inc., headquartered in San Bruno/California, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. As soon as you visit a website with a YouTube plug-in, a connection is set up to the YouTube servers. As part of this process the YouTube server is informed of the particular pages on our websites that you visited. If you are also logged in to your YouTube account, you would enable YouTube to assign your browsing habits directly to your personal profile.
You can prevent this assignment by logging out of your YouTube account beforehand. For more information on how YouTube collects and uses your data see the data protection policy at
https://www.youtube.com
.

Right to erasure
You may demand the person responsible to delete your personal information without delay and the person responsible will be required to erase that information immediately if they have objected or revoked consent to the storage  and there is no other legal basis for processing; if the knowledge of the personal data is no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the data was stored or if the storage is inadmissible for other legal reasons. Among other things, the right to erasure does not exist if the processing is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal rights.
Right to Information
If you have exercised your right to have the person responsible to correct, delete or restrict the processing, he / she is obliged to notify all recipients to whom your personal data have been disclosed of this correction or deletion of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves to be impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.

If the personal data concerning you are processed for direct advertising purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. If you object to processing for direct advertising purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.
Right to revoke the data protection consent declaration
You have the right to revoke your data protection consent declaration at any time. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.

X Privacy Policy
Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:
X is a public platform
Learn what’s viewable & searchable
We collect some data
about you
Learn what we collect & how
Affiliate services may have their own policies
Learn about affiliates
We use your data to make X better
Learn how we make your info work
You can control your experience
Learn how to update your settings
If you have questions about how we use data, just ask

10. How To Contact X
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us.
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
Personal Accounts.
If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
Professional Accounts.
If you create a
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.
Payment Information.
In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
Preferences.
When you set your preferences using your
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
Biometric Information.
Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.
Job Applications / Recommendations.
We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your activity on X, including:
Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.
We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).
Purchase and payments.
To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
Device Information.
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:
Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.
Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.
Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information.
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.
Inferred Identity.
We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:
When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.
When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.
Log Information.
We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:

Cookies and similar technologies.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.
3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether
videos you upload
are downloadable by others.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates

Nevertheless, Deca reserves the right to review the log data retroactively if there is a specific indication of illegal use.

However, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our websites.

Google Analytics
Our websites use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“
Google

Google uses this information, on behalf of the operator of our websites, for the purpose of evaluating your use of our websites, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage for the website operator.
In the event of the activation of IP anonymization on our websites, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contractual states of the treaty on the European Economic Area. This shortening eliminates the personal reference of your IP address. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a server of Google in the USA and truncated there. IP anonymization is active on our websites.
The IP address transmitted to us by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be combined with any other data held by Google. You may prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software. However, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our websites. You can also prevent the recording of data generated by the cookies about your use of the websites (including your IP address) by Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the plug-in available at the following link:  http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

These third parties are only permitted to use your personal data to the extent necessary to enable them to provide their services to us. They are required to follow our express instructions and to comply with appropriate security measures to protect your personal data.

Social Media Plug-ins
Our websites use social plug-ins of the social networks Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube to enhance our company's profile
on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). The underlying commercial purpose is to be considered a legitimate interest. The responsibility for operation in compliance with data protection regulations lies with the provider in each case. We include these plug-ins via the so-called two-click method to provide the users of our website with the best possible protection.
Facebook Social Plug-ins
Our websites use social plug-ins of the social network Facebook which is run by Facebook Inc., (1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA). The plug-ins can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white "f" on blue square or with a "thumbs-up" icon). The list and appearance of all the Facebook plug-ins can be seen here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
If you open our websites using that plug-in, the browser will establish a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook servers. The plug-in informs Facebook Inc. that a user has opened the respective website of the offer. There is a possibility that your IP address gets stored. If you are logged in with Facebook, Facebook can match such a site visit to the respective Facebook account. If you post a comment or click the like button the respective information is directly transmitted from your browser to Facebook and will be stored there. Deca thus does not have any influence on the nature and amount of data transferred by the plug-in to Facebook Inc. This data transfer is independent of a click by the user. You can find further information here: https://www.facebook.com/help/186325668085084.
In addition to this information you should also note Facebook's data protection regulations. Purpose and scope of the data collection and the further use of such data by Facebook as well as the respective rights and configuration options for protecting the user’s sphere of privacy can be taken from Facebook’s data protection notice https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. Further, there is the possibility to install an add-on which will block the Facebook plug-in and prevent the data transfer.
If you are a registered member of Facebook and would like to prevent Facebook from collecting data about you via this offer and matching that data with your member data stored with Facebook, you should log out of Facebook before visiting the respective website.
Twitter
Further, some of our websites use the Twitter buttons. Such plug-ins are run by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Ste. 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. They can be recognized by the terms "Twitter" or "Follow" combined with a stylized bird. Thanks to this button it is possible to share a post or a website of this offer on Twitter or to follow Deca on Twitter. If you open the respective website containing such a button, your browser will establish a direct connection with the Twitter servers. The contents of the Twitter button will be transmitted directly by Twitter to your browser. Deca does not have any influence on the amount of data collected by Twitter with such plug-ins and we herewith inform you in accordance with our knowledge. According to Twitter Inc. only the user’s IP address is transmitted and collected when retrieving the button. Further information can be taken from Twitter’s data protection notice at
http://twitter.com/privacy
. However, please note that you have the option of changing your data protection settings on Twitter in your Twitter account settings at
http://twitter.com/account/settings
.
YouTube
Some of our websites also include a YouTube plug-in belonging to Google Inc., headquartered in San Bruno/California, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. As soon as you visit a website with a YouTube plug-in, a connection is set up to the YouTube servers. As part of this process the YouTube server is informed of the particular pages on our websites that you visited. If you are also logged in to your YouTube account, you would enable YouTube to assign your browsing habits directly to your personal profile.
You can prevent this assignment by logging out of your YouTube account beforehand. For more information on how YouTube collects and uses your data see the data protection policy at
https://www.youtube.com
