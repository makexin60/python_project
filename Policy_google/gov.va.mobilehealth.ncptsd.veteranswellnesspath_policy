Privacy Policy for NCPTSD Mobile Apps
When you use a VA mobile app, no data that could be used to identify you is sent to VA or third parties. Any information that you enter into the app, such as names, phone numbers, addresses, images, or music, cannot be accessed, stored, or shared by VA.
VA mobile apps do collect anonymous information about how people use the app. It is only used for research purposes and to improve how well the app works. We can see what sections of the app people visit, and their entries in health data tracking, for example.
We often use this information to correct technical problems in the apps or to better understand which parts of the app are most helpful. This information cannot be linked to any personal information about you and will never be shared with a third party.
If you would like to turn off sending this anonymous usage information, go to the Settings menu, look for "Anonymous Usage Data," and flip the switch to the "off" setting.
Anonymous usage data is stored as long as needed for research purposes but does not contain any personal or identifying information that could ever be linked back to you. Because no identifying information is associated with your data, we currently do not support data deletion requests.
VA uses some software analysis tools to help identify and prevent app problems. VA mobile apps do not share personal or identifying information with any of the vendors of these tools.
In using a VA mobile app, it is your responsibility to protect any information in the app once it is installed on your device. Setting a passcode on your device is recommended to help keep your information safe.
