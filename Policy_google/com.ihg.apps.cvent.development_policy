Privacy Statement
The privacy and security of your information is very important to us. Whether you are visiting our website, using our app, booking a room, or are a member of one of our loyalty programs, we want you to trust the way that we manage your information and to keep you informed about how we use that information.
We have prepared this Privacy Statement to explain more about who we are, how we collect and manage your information (whether through our website, mobile apps and other IHG® Hotels & Resorts-branded digital channels (e.g., our branded IHG Connect WiFi), our social media pages, or offline) and the choices you have about how we use your information. Specific additional rights may apply if required by applicable law. For example, please view our additional disclosures directed to residents of
California
and the
UK and European Economic Area (EEA)
and

and the
People’s Republic of China (Excluding for The purposes of this statement Hong Kong Sar, Macau Sar and Taiwan) (“PRC”)
and

in this Privacy Statement.
Who we are
This Privacy Statement is issued by the InterContinental Hotels Group of Companies (collectively referred to as "IHG”, “IHG
®
Hotels & Resorts”, "we”, "us” or "our” in this Privacy Statement), which includes the direct and indirect subsidiaries of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and covers information that we collect and use in the course of our business. When we mention "IHG", “IHG
®
Hotels & Resorts”, "we", "us", or "our", we are referring to the relevant company in the InterContinental Hotels Group that processes your personal information. Your information may also be collected and used by IHG
®
Hotels & Resorts-branded hotels. In most cases, these hotels are independently owned, and their use of your information is covered by their own privacy notices, not this one. If you would like to learn more about IHG and our relationship with our IHG

Hotels & Resorts-branded hotels, click below.
About IHG
We are a global hospitality company operating in more than 100 countries. We predominantly franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, independent owners. We also operate a number of programs that are related to our hotel business such as IHG
®
One Rewards, which is our core loyalty program.
About our IHG-branded hotels
We franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, independent owners (“IHG® Hotels & Resorts-branded hotels” or “IHG-branded hotels”). Most hotels operating under IHG’s brands are independently owned and operated by parties that have entered into a franchise agreement with IHG that allows them to use an IHG brand for the purposes of operating a hotel. If you make a reservation through us to stay at an IHG-branded hotel, we will share your information with that hotel in order to enable the performance of your hospitality request. However, as IHG-branded hotels are not owned or controlled by IHG, their use of your information will generally be governed by their own privacy practices.
Information we collect and how we use and share it
We collect personal information directly from you, about you from other persons/entities/online channels, and automatically as you use our website, mobile application or other IHG-branded digital channels, and through certain offerings or services available at IHG-branded properties (such as IHG Connect WI-FI). We provide more detail in the sections below. In particular, we collect and use information about you if you (or someone on your behalf) makes a reservation to stay at an IHG-branded hotel or property offered through IHG reservations, participate in one of our loyalty programs such as IHG® One Rewards, or interact with us through our corporate site, mobile app or other IHG-branded digital channels. You do not have to provide us with your personal information in order to use our website or mobile app; in some cases, however, we may not be able to provide services to you without your personal information (for example, we would not be able to complete a requested booking or enroll you in our rewards program). To learn more about how we collect, use and share your information, and how you can opt out, please click the relevant section below.
If you make a reservation or stay at an IHG-branded hotel
Information we collect:
Directly From You: We collect information from you when you make a booking through our reservation system or stay at an IHG-branded hotel. Information collected during the course of the reservation and during your stay may include:
Your name, email address, home and business address, phone number, nationality and payment card information;
Information relating to your membership in one of our services or programs or those of our program partners such as your IHG® One Rewards number or frequent flier number; and
Information such as stay and room preferences made during the course of your reservation such as your preferred room type and specific requests to the hotel.
If you provide personal information to us about other persons when making a booking or during your stay, for example, family members or colleagues, we ask you to make sure they are happy for their personal information to be shared with us and to direct them to read this Privacy Statement if they want to find out more about how we use their information.
From Other Sources: We also collect reservation information about you from other persons/entities, including, travel agents, websites not owned and operated by IHG, persons booking on your behalf (e.g., a family member, company representative), your employer, or other entity. If you make a reservation directly with one of our IHG-branded properties, we typically receive a copy of that reservation. We also may collect information about you (indirectly) from airlines and other travel providers connected with your reservation; for example, we may learn your arrival time from a travel partner and use this information to contact you about early check-in options. We may obtain information about you from social media pages; for example, if you make a comment on IHG’s social media page or if you comment about IHG on a public social media feed. We use this information to improve our services to you and to other customers.
Automatically: We collect information about you automatically as you use our website, mobile app, our social media sites, interact with our other digital channels, and, in some instances, when we correspond with you through email. In these instances, information such as your country information, internet protocol (“IP”) address, medial access control address, your interactions with these channels, and other characteristics about your system or device may be automatically collected. This information is collected for functional purposes as well as to improve your experience when using these services. This information may also be used for aggregated trend and statistical analysis, and for showing you more relevant advertisements and messages. More information on these practices can be found in the
Using our websites, mobile applications, and other technologies
section below. We do not typically associate an IP address with your IHG® One Rewards profile.
Special Hotel Programs/Biometrics: At IHG, we are always seeking more ways to enhance your experience with us. A limited number of properties now offer a biometrics check-in process to eliminate your need to stand in line. Some properties also may allow room access through the collection of biometric information. These programs are opt-in only, and any information that we collect through your participation will be used solely for the program as described in the notice provided to you at the time of the opt-in.
How we use this information:
We use your information from you primarily to fulfill your hotel reservation and to provide and manage our IHG
®
One Rewards program. This may include communicating with you (e.g., sending a confirmation email) in advance of your stay. Following your stay, we may also send you post-stay communications and satisfaction surveys to get feedback on your experience. When you stay at a hotel, we do not receive all of the information about your stay; for example, if you book a spa visit, that spa service may be provided either by the IHG-branded hotel (not IHG) or by a local entity.
In some instances, and where we have your consent or where permitted under applicable law, we may send you marketing communications (which may include text messages or calls placed using autodialer technology) for products and services that we believe would be relevant for you. We also may use information related to your stay to display targeted advertisements on our websites, mobile apps, our other digital channels or on non-affiliated websites or mobile apps, or to send you more relevant messaging. Additionally, we aggregate your information with other guest information to complete trend and statistical analysis, which we use to evaluate and improve our products and services, plan new hotel locations and services, and for other market research.
We will indicate whether the requested information is mandatory; the failure to provide such information may impact our ability to and/or prevent us from providing certain services to you.
Who we share your information with:
We share your reservation information as follows:
Properties: We share reservation information with the property you are staying at to fulfill your reservation. Please note that we do not share all of your information with the property location; for example, we share your reservation details (such as name, dates of stay, and certain of your IHG® One Rewards information if you are a member such as whether you are a member and your member tier).
Service Providers: We will share your information with service providers to provide services in relation to our business as well as to help us improve our products and services. For example, we might use a service provider or a service provider’s product for the purposes of market research and data analytics, or share data with online partners we work with, so we, or our online partners on our behalf, can communicate with you and serve advertisements through their platforms or on other websites or platforms. In certain instances, subject to local consent requirements, our service providers may also assist us with various marketing campaigns. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Partners: Where permitted by applicable law, or where we have your consent, we may also share your information with other parties, including our IHG® One Rewards partners and others, to extend special offers about their own products and services to you. In an effort to offer you a more seamless travel experience, we have partnered with other companies that may be involved in your travel plans (e.g., airlines, rental car companies) through a common service provider and may, where permitted by law, share certain information about your upcoming travel. We use this information to try to customize our products and services to you (e.g., late/early check-in) or for you to receive offers related to your travel from other companies. You have options about whether you wish to receive these communications and offers; please log into the IHG® One Rewards preference center at any time to view and exercise your communications choices. In addition, California residents have the option of clicking on the “Do Not Sell” link, which would eliminate the sharing that might constitute a sale under California’s law. Other requests may be directed to one of our
global customer care offices
or the Privacy Office.
We also share your stay information with other entities, which may include law enforcement, professional advisors, and other persons, in circumstances such as:
when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or to protect the safety of hotel guests, employees, the public or IHG property;
when disclosure is required to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, warrant or legal process; or
in the event of a merger, asset sale, or other related transaction.

Data Transfer
As we operate via a global network of corporate offices, reservation and service centers, data centers and hotels, it may be necessary to transfer your information, for example, information collected in connection with making a reservation or stay at an IHG-branded hotel, joining one of our loyalty programs or interacting with us through our corporate site, websites, emails or our other digital channels to a country outside of the country where it was originally collected or outside of your country of residence or nationality. The information that you provide us during the course of a reservation or through the provision of any other services may be transferred to any of our IHG-owned or affiliated entities and hotels around the world for the purposes of carrying out or facilitating these services. It will also be necessary to transfer this information to other entities, including, without limitation, our IHG-branded hotels, partners and our service providers.
Where we transfer information which originates in the European Union ("EU") or the United Kingdom (“UK”) or in Brazil to a country outside of the EU or UK or Brazil, we will take steps to make sure such transfer is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights:
transfers within the IHG Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the IHG Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that your information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the IHG Group;
where we transfer your data outside of the IHG Group including to other companies providing us with a service, we will obtain contractual commitments and assurances from them to protect your information. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes such as standard contractual clauses;
we will only transfer personal information to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights; and
any requests for information we receive from law enforcement or regulators will be carefully validated before personal information is disclosed, where permitted by the applicable law.
When we otherwise transfer personal information between jurisdictions, we will take such steps as required by local law in an effort to ensure that such transfer is managed to protect your privacy rights.

Location Information and Services
In some jurisdictions, and where permitted by applicable law or with your consent, we may receive information about your location during the course of and for the purpose of providing you the services described above through your use of our websites and mobile applications. For example, if you are using our mobile applications and have consented to sharing your location information with us, this information might be collected through GPS or Bluetooth technologies to enable us to provide certain services to you such as customized offers and promotions. In addition to your use of our websites, mobile applications and other digital channels, we may also receive location information from wireless networks or cellular towers in proximity to your mobile device, through your Internet protocol (“IP”) address or through your use of other services we provide at our hotels. We may also have access to location information that you provide to us through your use of social media, such as when you “tweet” your location. We do not maintain this information as part of your IHG® One Rewards profile, and we typically use this information at the point in time at which you provide it to satisfy your request. Your location preferences can be set or modified at the device level or through modifying your settings with the relevant social media platform.
Mobile Applications
We receive information about you when you use our mobile applications. Some information such as your device manufacturer, type and operating system version, are collected automatically, while other information is only collected if you choose to provide it and where permitted by applicable law, such as your precise geolocation information. We do not typically associate your precise geolocation information obtained through your use of our mobile apps with your IHG® One Rewards Account. It may sometimes be necessary to associate your geolocation information with your account to support your participation in a particular program or feature that we may offer, but we do not otherwise retain your geolocation information in a way that identifies you as an individual.
If you use our mobile app, we also send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile applications on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
Online Channels and Other Information Sources
We may use information from online sources, such as websites, social media and information sharing platforms.

Use of WI-FI services (IHG Connect)
When you use the IHG Connect WI-FI service (IHG Connect), we may collect and process certain additional information.
What information we collect
Registration and User-Provided Information:
When you register to use IHG Connect, we may collect personal information about you including your last name, IHG® One Rewards number, room number and, depending on your location and applicable law, other personal information (such as mobile phone number). You may also provide us with personal information about you in various ways when you use IHG Connect, for example, when you send us customer service-related requests.
Device Identifiers.
In the course of providing IHG Connect, we may automatically collect a device identifier (such as your IP address, MAC address, or device name or other unique identifier) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device you use to access IHG Connect. A device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device when you access IHG Connect, and we may identify your device by its device identifier. When you use IHG Connect, we may view your device identifier and use this information to enhance our service. We may associate your device identifier with other information about you, such as your IHG® One Rewards number.
Other device information:
We may also automatically record certain information from your device including, device type, the web pages, apps or sites that you visit, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use IHG Connect (Internet activity information). While generally this information is pseudonymous and/or aggregated, this information may be associated with your IHG® One Rewards number and/or other IHG service account information or persistent identifiers. This data helps us to manage our networks and provides us with information about the use of IHG Connect. We do not, however, collect and process the contents of email communications or other electronic communications you send or receive when using IHG Connect.
Location information:
We may collect information about your location through your use of the WI-FI services we provide at our hotels to enable us to improve our service and provide certain services to you such as customized offers and promotions.
How We Use the Information We Collect
We use personal information only for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, except if otherwise disclosed to you at the time the data is collected or otherwise authorized by law or by you. We use the personal information that we collect through IHG Connect:
to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the service, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and to provide support to users.
to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the IHG Connect service, and to develop new products, services, features, and functionality. If you provide your contact information or your IHG® One Rewards number, we may (with your consent or where permitted by applicable law) send you personalized offers based on your web usage and location. You can opt out of receiving these offers when signing in to use the IHG Connect service or at any time within your IHG® One Rewards account. Please see the '

.
To access personal information
You can ask us to confirm whether or not we have and are using your personal information and for a copy of your information.
To correct / erase personal information
You can ask us to correct any information about you which is incorrect. We will be happy to rectify such information but would need to verify the accuracy of the information first.
You can ask us to erase your information if you think we no longer need to use it for the purpose we collected it from you. You can also ask us to erase your information if you have either withdrawn your consent to us using your information (if we originally asked for your consent to use your information), or exercised your right to object to further legitimate use of your information, or where we have used it unlawfully or where we are subject to a legal obligation to erase your personal information.
We may not always be able to comply with your request, for example where we need to keep using your information to comply with our legal obligation or where we need to use your information to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
To restrict how we use personal information
You can ask us to restrict our use of your information in certain circumstances, for example:
where you think the information is inaccurate and we need to verify it;
where our use of your information is not lawful but you do not want us to erase it;
where the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected but we need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
where you have objected to our use of your personal information but we still need to verify if we have overriding grounds to use it.
We can continue to use your information following a request for restriction where we have your consent to use it; or we need to use it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or we need to use it to protect the rights of another individual or a company.
To object to how we use your information
You can object to any use of your information which we have justified on the basis of our legitimate interest, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms to data protection outweigh our legitimate interest in using the information. If you raise an objection, we may continue to use your information if we can demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests to use the information.
You can also require us to stop using your data for direct marketing purposes.
To ask us to transfer your information to another organization
You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller (e.g. another company).
You may only exercise this right where we use your information in order to perform a contract with you, or where we asked for your consent to use your information. This right does not apply to any information which we hold or process that is not held in digital form.
Right to obtain a copy of personal information safeguards used for transfers outside your jurisdiction
You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside of the European Union or the UK.
We may redact data transfer agreements to protect commercial terms.
We may ask you for proof of identity when making a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to make sure that we only disclose information where we know we are dealing with the right individual. We will not ask for a fee, unless we think your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Where a fee is necessary, we will inform you before proceeding with your request.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may however take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We will let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. To help us respond more quickly, we may ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are otherwise legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), we are required to notify California consumers about our collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information (whether collected through this website or offline). In this section of our Privacy Statement, and in accordance with the CCPA, “personal information” includes any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household, including the categories identified in the table below to the extent they identify, relate to, describe, are capable of being associated with, or could be reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to applicants for positions with IHG.
Categories of Personal Information that We Collect, Disclose, and Sell
Below we identify the categories of personal information that we collect about California consumers and households, the purposes for which we use each category, and whether we disclose or sell information within each category. Please note our data collection practices set forth below are not different than those described above; rather, the CCPA specifies particular categories of data that we must address, and, in this section, we aim to describe some of the information already provided above in accordance with the categories as outlined by the CCPA. This section should therefore be read in conjunction with the further information provided in the rest of this Privacy Statement.
Please note that the CCPA defines the term “sale” very broadly to include any exchange of data for consideration of any kind, not simply selling your data for monetary compensation.
Identifiers and Similar Data:
Collection.
We collect:
Identifiers: your real name, alias, postal address, unique identifier (e.g., your IHG® One Rewards number if you choose to enroll in the program), IP address (if you access our websites, emails or other digital channels), email address or other similar identifiers.
Signature, physical characteristics, telephone number, financial information (e.g., payment information for your reservation). We typically do not collect medical information from our guests absent an emergency situation or specific request (which typically would be information provided to us by IHG-branded hotels and not information that we collect directly from you).
Commercial information, including products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.
Internet or other electronic network activity information, including browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an Internet Web site, application, or advertisement.
Sources:
We collect the information directly from you, from other persons/entities making a reservation on your behalf (e.g., travel agent, a member of your travel party, someone making the booking on your behalf), from IHG-branded hotels (that are independently owned and operated). In limited circumstances, we may obtain this information from carefully selected travel partners, including airlines and rental car agencies. With regard to internet or other electronic information, we collect that information automatically as you use our Site and services.
Purposes of Collection:
The primary purpose of our collection and use of this information is to fulfil your reservations and enhance and personalize your experience with us. In particular, we use your information to fulfil your reservation, manage your IHG® One Rewards account, direct marketing to you (in connection with your preferences), targeted and personalized advertising to you, and as otherwise required by applicable law.
Disclosure:
We disclose this information for business purposes, including at your direction, to IHG-branded properties (e.g., if you make a reservation through our central reservation department, then we share that information with the applicable property so that they can fulfil your request). We also share certain of your information to our carefully selected partners, including airlines and rental car agencies, for the purpose of personalizing your stay; for example, if we know that you are arriving early in the morning, we may seek to offer you an early check-in. If you use our WiFi services at IHG-branded properties, we share certain unique identifiers like your device’s MAC address with our internet service providers to provide WiFi to you.
Sale:
We use third party targeted advertising companies that collect certain information about you through website cookies (and similar technologies designed for mobile applications). These third parties may collect information about you that they then aggregate with data collected about you through cookies placed on other websites/mobile apps. Under the CCPA, this type of sharing of information could be deemed a “sale”. We also disclose your information to carefully selected marketing partners, advertising technology vendors and social media platforms through a central marketing/analytics company. We direct which entities may have access to your information and the scope of information to which they may access. This type of disclosure only occurs in limited markets and California consumers may opt-out at any time through our communications portal and by clicking on the
Do Not Sell link
on our website/in the mobile app.
Protected Classifications/Audio/Visual Data:
Collection:
We do not request information about protected classifications under California law such as race, sex, age, religion, national origin, disability, citizenship information, or genetic information. Nonetheless, we may capture information related to these categories in the following circumstances, by way of example only: IHG corporate offices and certain IHG-branded hotels use closed circuit television for security purposes, and, the recordings may capture such information by virtue of the recording. We do not obtain recordings from the IHG-branded properties absent a unique situation (e.g., concern for security at a particular property). You have the option of providing your age range when you sign up for IHG® One Rewards, but we do not require you to disclose that information. You have the option of requesting an accessible room.
Sources:
We collect the information directly from you, from other persons/entities making a reservation on your behalf (e.g., travel agent, a member of your travel party, someone making the booking on your behalf), from IHG-branded hotels (that are independently owned and operated). In limited circumstances, we may obtain this information from carefully selected travel partners, including airlines and rental car agencies.
Purposes of Collection:
The primary purpose of our collection and use of this information is to enhance and personalize your stay with us, in particular, to provide you with the specific room type requested. We may use video surveillance for security purposes and to protect their rights and interests as well as the rights and interests of other guests.
Disclosure:
We disclose any information about special requests for business purposes, including at your direction, to IHG-branded properties (e.g., if you make a reservation through our central reservation department, then we share that information with the applicable property so that they can fulfil your request). If we obtain CCTV footage, we do not disclose such data except as necessary to protect our rights and interests and the rights and interests of other persons.
Sale:
We do not sell this information.
Biometric and Geolocation Information:
Information Collected:
In an effort to enhance your stay with us and to provide for a faster and easier check-in process, we may offer certain services on property such as check-in and/or room entry through the use of biometric identifiers at a limited number of IHG-branded properties.

With your consent, we collect your geolocation information through our mobile application and our website or from internet service providers through certain services we offer on property such as IHG Connect (WiFi). We use this information for analytics purposes (e.g., to determine the general area where our guests may access our services from), to personalize your experience (e.g., suggest hotels of interest), and, in certain limited markets, to provide special offers based on your location.

We collect biometric information and geolocation information directly from you and automatically as you use devices designed to collect biometric information or, in the case of geolocation information, your own device.

Sale:
We do not sell your biometric information.
Inferences
We may draw (or use service providers to draw) inferences from any of the information identified above to create or enhance a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences and tendencies (e.g., what types of properties the consumer prefers, how frequently the consumer travels, etc.). We may purchase aggregated and deidentified data and append such data to your profile (e.g., based on your age range) to assist us in determining relevant marketing opportunities.
Sources:
We draw inferences based on the data collection described in this Notice.
Purposes of Collection:
We use inferences to enhance your overall experience with IHG. For example, we may use inferences to identify and to offer relevant marketing opportunities.

Whether you are visiting our website, using our app, booking a room, or are a member of one of our loyalty programs, we want you to trust the way that we manage your information and to keep you informed about how we use that information.
We have prepared this Privacy Statement to explain more about who we are, how we collect and manage your information (whether through our website, mobile apps and other IHG® Hotels & Resorts-branded digital channels (e.g., our branded IHG Connect WiFi), our social media pages, or offline) and the choices you have about how we use your information.

Who we are
This Privacy Statement is issued by InterContinental Hotels Group (collectively referred to as "IHG”, “IHG® Hotels & Resorts”, "we”, "us” or "our” in this Privacy Statement), which includes the direct and indirect subsidiaries of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and covers information that we collect and use in the course of our business. When we mention "IHG", “IHG
®
Hotels & Resorts”, "we", "us", or "our", we are referring to the relevant company in the InterContinental Hotels Group that processes your personal information. Your information may also be collected and used by IHG
®
Hotels & Resorts-branded hotels. In most cases, these hotels are independently owned, and their use of your information is covered by their own privacy notices, not this one. If you would like to learn more about IHG and our relationship with our IHG
®
Hotels & Resorts-branded hotels, click below.
We are a global hospitality company operating in more than 100 countries. We predominantly franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, independent owners. We also operate programs that are related to our hotel business such as IHG® One Rewards, which is our core loyalty program.
We franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, independent owners (“IHG® Hotels & Resorts-branded hotels” or “IHG-branded hotels”). Most hotels operating under IHG’s brands are independently owned and operated by parties that have entered into a franchise agreement with IHG that allows them to use an IHG brand for the purposes of operating a hotel. References to IHG-branded hotels also include Iberostar Beachfront Resorts which can be booked via IHG’s reservation system and which are part of IHG® One Rewards. If you make a reservation through us to stay at an IHG-branded hotel, we will disclose certain information with that hotel in order to enable your stay at the hotel. However, as IHG-branded hotels are not owned or controlled by IHG, their use of your information will be governed by their own privacy practices.
Information we collect and how we use and share it
We collect personal information directly from you, about you from other persons/entities/online channels, and automatically as you use our website, mobile application or other IHG-branded digital channels, and through services available at IHG-branded properties (such as IHG Connect Wi-Fi). We provide more detail in the sections below. In particular, we collect and use information about you if you (or someone on your behalf) makes a reservation to stay at an IHG-branded hotel or property offered through IHG reservations, participate in one of our loyalty programs such as IHG® One Rewards, or interact with us through our corporate site, mobile app or other IHG-branded digital channels. You do not have to provide us with your personal information in order to use our website or mobile app; however, in some cases we may not be able to provide services to you without your personal information (for example, we would not be able to complete a requested booking or enroll you in our rewards program). To learn more about how we collect, use and disclose your information, and how you can opt out, please click the relevant section below.
Information we collect:
Directly From You: We collect information from you when you make a booking through our reservation system, stay at an IHG-branded hotel, or respond to a survey. Information collected during the reservation and your stay may include:
Your name, email address, home and business address, phone number, nationality and payment card information; for some reservations we may also collect national ID/passport information on behalf of the IHG-branded hotel where this is required by the hotel to comply with applicable local laws or by the hotel’s local policies.
Information relating to your membership in one of our services or programs or those of our program partners such as your IHG® One Rewards number or airline frequent flier number; and
Information such as stay and room preferences made during your reservation such as your preferred room type and specific requests to the hotel.
If you provide personal information to us about other persons when making a booking or during your stay, for example, family members or colleagues, we ask you to make sure they are happy for their personal information to be disclosed with us and to direct them to read this Privacy Statement if they want to find out more about how we use their information.
From IHG-branded properties: We receive information about your bookings and stays from IHG branded hotels including those you booked directly with the property. The information we receive includes names of those included on the booking, dates of your stay, number of adults and children staying, rate detail, room type, board type/meal plans and purchases made during your stay.
From Other Sources: We also collect reservation information about you from other persons/entities, including, travel agents, websites not owned and operated by IHG, persons booking on your behalf (e.g., a family member, company representative), your employer, or other entity. We may obtain information about you from social media pages; for example, if you make a comment on IHG’s social media page or if you comment about IHG on a public social media feed. We use this information to improve our services to you and to other customers.
Automatically: We collect information about you automatically as you use our website, mobile app, our social media sites, interact with our other digital channels, and, in some instances, when we correspond with you through email. In these instances, information such as your country information, internet protocol (“IP”) address, device ID, medial access control address, your interactions with these channels, and other characteristics about your system or device may be automatically collected. This information is collected for functional purposes and to improve your experience when using these services. This information may also be used for fraud prevention, aggregated trend and statistical analysis, and for showing you more relevant advertisements and messages. More information on these practices can be found in the
Using our websites, mobile applications, and other technologies
section below. We do not typically associate an IP address with your IHG® One Rewards profile.
Special Hotel Programs/Biometrics: At IHG, we are always seeking more ways to enhance your experience with us. A limited number of properties now offer a biometrics check-in process to eliminate your need to stand in line. Some properties also may allow room access through the collection of biometric information. These programs are opt-in only, and any information that we collect through your participation will be used solely for the program as described in the notice provided to you at the time of the opt-in.
How we use this information:
We use your information primarily to fulfill your hotel reservations, including indicated preferences, and to provide and manage our IHG® One Rewards program. This may include communicating with you (e.g., sending a confirmation email or SMS text message) in advance of your stay. Following your stay, we may also send you post-stay communications and satisfaction surveys to get feedback on your experience.
Where we have your consent or as permitted under applicable law, we may send you marketing communications for products and services that we believe would be relevant for you. We also may use information related to you and your stays to display targeted advertisements on our websites, mobile apps, our other digital channels or on non-affiliated websites or mobile apps, or to send you more relevant messaging. Additionally, we aggregate your information with other guest information to complete trend and statistical analysis, which we use to evaluate and improve our products and services, plan new hotel locations and services, and for other market research.
Who we disclose your information with:
We disclose your reservation information as follows:
IHG-Branded Properties: We disclose your reservation information with the property you are staying at to fulfill your reservation and for properties to communicate with you regarding your stay. This includes information such as name, email address, dates of your stay, payment information, passport/national ID information where this is required by the hotel, and IHG® One Rewards information such as your member tier, and length of membership.
Service Providers: We will disclose your information with service providers to provide services related to our business, to help us improve our products and services and to detect and prevent fraud. For example, we might use a service provider or a service provider’s product for the purposes of market research and data analytics, to gather information necessary to resolve payment disputes, to communicate with you and serve advertisements through their platforms or on other websites or platforms. In certain instances, subject to local consent requirements, our service providers may also assist us with various marketing campaigns. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Partners: Where permitted by applicable law, or where we have your consent, we may also disclose your information with other parties, including our IHG® One Rewards partners and others, to extend special offers about their own products and services to you. You have options about whether you wish to receive these communications and offers; please log into the IHG® One Rewards preference center at any time to view and exercise your communications choices. In addition, certain U.S. state residents may have the option of clicking on the “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
” link, which would eliminate the sharing that might constitute a sale under applicable law. Other requests may be directed to one of our
global customer care offices
or the
Privacy Office
.
We also disclose your stay information with other entities, which may include law enforcement, professional advisors, and other persons, in circumstances such as:
when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or to protect the safety of hotel guests, employees, the public or IHG property;
when disclosure is required to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, warrant or legal process; or
in the event of a merger, asset sale, or other related transaction.

We may also obtain Personal Information from data enrichment providers where permitted under applicable law.
Other Sources: We may obtain information about you from social media pages; for example, if you make a comment on IHG’s social media page or if you comment about IHG on a public social media feed.

Data Transfer
As we operate via a global network of corporate offices, reservation and service centers, data centers and hotels, it may be necessary to transfer your information, for example, information collected in connection with a reservation or stay at an IHG-branded hotel, joining one of our loyalty programs or interacting with us through our corporate site, websites, emails or our other digital channels to a country outside of the country where it was originally collected or outside of your country of residence or nationality. The information that you provide us during the course of a reservation or through the provision of any other services may be transferred to any of our IHG-owned or affiliated entities and hotels around the world for the purposes of carrying out or facilitating these services. It will also be necessary to transfer this information to other entities, including, without limitation, our IHG-branded hotels, partners and our service providers.
Where we transfer information which originates in the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom (“UK”), Brazil, or Turkey to a country outside of the country of origination, we will take steps to make sure such transfer is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights:
transfers within the IHG Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the IHG Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that your information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the IHG Group;
where we transfer your data outside of the IHG Group including to other companies providing us with a service, we will obtain contractual commitments and assurances from them to protect your information. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes such as standard contractual clauses;
we will only transfer personal information to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection , or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights, or after having obtained explicit consent from you; and
any requests for information we receive from law enforcement or regulators will be validated before personal information is disclosed, where permitted by the applicable law.
When we otherwise transfer personal information between jurisdictions, we will take such steps as required by local law in an effort to ensure that such transfer is managed to protect your privacy rights.

For example, if you are using our mobile applications and have consented to sharing your location information with us, this information might be collected through GPS or Bluetooth technologies to enable us to provide certain services to you such as customized offers and promotions. In addition to your use of our websites, mobile applications and other digital channels, we may also receive location information from wireless networks or cellular towers in proximity to your mobile device, through your Internet protocol (“IP”) address or through your use of other services we provide at our hotels. We may also have access to location information that you provide to us through your use of social media, such as when you “tweet” your location.

Your location preferences can be set or modified at the device level or through modifying your settings with the relevant social media platform.
We receive information about you when you use our mobile applications. Some information such as your device manufacturer, type and operating system version, are collected automatically, while other information is only collected if you choose to provide it and where permitted by applicable law, such as your precise geolocation information. We do not typically associate your precise geolocation information obtained through your use of our mobile apps with your IHG® One Rewards Account. It may sometimes be necessary to associate your geolocation information with your account to support your participation in a particular program or feature that we may offer, but we do not otherwise retain your geolocation information in a way that identifies you as an individual.
If you use our mobile app, we also send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running.

This information may be used to help tailor and improve our services and communicate with you effectively, as we know many of our customers use a range of media channels to communicate and disclose information.
We may use various social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button on our websites and mobile applications. We collect certain information about you through your use of these features in conjunction with our services and programs. Subject to your account and privacy settings, we may also be able to see information that you post when using these social media platforms. In some instances, depending on the circumstances, we may contact you on these social media platforms. The information you post on social media sites as well as the controls surrounding these disclosures are governed by the respective policies of the social media site.

To access personal information
You can ask us to confirm whether or not we have, how we are using your personal information and, if applicable, for a copy of your information.
To correct / erase personal information
You can ask us to correct any information about you which is incorrect We will be happy to rectify such information but would need to verify the accuracy of the information first.
You can ask us to erase your information if you think we no longer need to use it for the purpose we collected it from you. You can also ask us to erase your information if you have either withdrawn your consent to us using your information (if we originally asked for your consent to use your information), or exercised your right to object to further legitimate use of your information, or where we have used it unlawfully or where we are subject to a legal obligation to erase your personal information. Also, depending on your location you may have the right to request reporting of the erasure requests to third parties to whom your personal data has been transferred.
We may not always be able to comply with your request, for example where we need to keep using your information to comply with our legal obligation or where we need to use your information to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
To restrict how we use personal information
You can ask us to restrict our use of your information in certain circumstances, for example:
where you think the information is inaccurate and we need to verify it;
where our use of your information is not lawful but you do not want us to erase it;
where the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected but we need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
where you have objected to our use of your personal information but we still need to verify if we have overriding grounds to use it.
We can continue to use your information following a request for restriction where we have your consent to use it; or we need to use it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or we need to use it to protect the rights of another individual or a company.
To object to how we use your information
You can object to any use of your information which we have justified on the basis of our legitimate interest, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms to data protection outweigh our legitimate interest in using the information. If you raise an objection, we may continue to use your information if we can demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests to use the information.
Based on the available data protection rights, you can also require us to stop using your data for direct marketing purposes and, if applicable, object to decisions about you based on processing of your personal data, exclusively by automatic means.
To request information about data transfers to third parties
Depending on your location, you may have the right to ask us for information about which  third parties  your personal data has been transferred to.

You may only exercise this right where we use your information in order to perform a contract with you, or where we asked for your consent to use your information. This right does not apply to any information which we hold or process that is not held in digital form.
Right to obtain a copy of personal information safeguards used for transfers outside your jurisdiction
Depending on your location you may be able to ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside of the European Union or the UK.  We may redact data transfer agreements to protect commercial terms.
We may ask you for proof of identity when making a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to make sure that we only disclose information where we know we are dealing with the right individual. We will not ask for a fee, unless we think your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Where a fee is necessary, we will inform you before proceeding with your request.
We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may however take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We will let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. To help us respond more quickly, we may ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.
We may not always be able to do what you have asked, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are otherwise legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.
