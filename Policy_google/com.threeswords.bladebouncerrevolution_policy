Effective date: June 23rd, 2019
We at Three Swords Studio know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.
Remember that your use of Three Swords’ Services is at all times subject to the
Terms of Use
, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.
If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data. Please read our
GDPR Privacy Notice
for more information.
What does this Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.
As noted in the
Terms of Use
, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 (or if you are in the EU, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16). If you are under 13 (or under 16 in the EU), please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 (or under age 16 in the EU), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 (or under 16 in the EU) may have provided us personal information, please contact us at
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
.
Will Three Swords ever change this Privacy Policy?
We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice in the App or Website and/or by some other means. Please note that you are responsible for reading all notices and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
What information does Three Swords collect?
Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, if you email us at
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
, we may collect Personal Information that you provide to us in connection with such email communication (such as email address and name). Note, however, that while we will receive your email address if you email us at
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
, you do not need to provide your first or last name or any other Personal Information when you contact us, and we will not store your Personal Information for longer than required to address your issues or concerns.
We may also collect Personal Information that you choose to provide through any voluntary surveys that we may send through the App about your experience with our Services, including gender and age. Providing your email address to us through these surveys is optional. We use information from these surveys to improve your experience with the App.
If you connect the App to a third-party account (e.g., Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”)), you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into the App if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. For example, when you connect the App to Facebook, we will collect your first name, ID, token and profile picture url from Facebook in order to create and maintain your user profile, to sync your progress, and to surface your name on a leaderboard with any other Facebook friends that have also connected the App to their Facebook accounts.
Information Collected Automatically:
Whenever you interact with our Website or App, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, advertising identifiers (such as IDFAs/IDFVs), “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and “remember” your browser during subsequent visits for purposes of functionality, preferences, and website performance. They also tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies as follows:
For iOS:
Every iOS includes an advertising identifier (IDFA) with two key features:
Users can reset the identifier at any time.
Users can also opt out of all remarketing campaigns by activating the Limit Ad Tracking (LAT) setting, thus keeping advertisers from using the device’s IDFA for behavioral advertising. For more information about how to enable this setting, click
here
.
For Android:
Every Android device includes an advertising identifier (AAID). To opt out or to change its settings, follow these steps:
If using Android 2.3 or above, select “Google settings” in the app drawer.
Select “Ads”.
Select “Reset advertising ID” to generate a new identifier and eliminate any previously stored data.
Then select “Opt out of interest-based ads”.
Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.
We may use data that we collect automatically from you to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
Where is my Personal Information stored and processed?
Your Personal Information will be stored and processed in the EU and in the United States. We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union to the United States. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the seven Privacy Shield Principles of (1) notice, (2) consent, (3) accountability for onward transfer, (4) security, (5) data integrity and purpose limitation, (6) access and (7) recourse, enforcement and liability, in relation to any Personal Information that we receive from within the European Union (the “Privacy Shield Principles”). Principle 7, the recourse, enforcement and liability principle, provides that we remain potentially liable if a third party processing Personal Information received from the European Union on our behalf processes that Personal Information in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles (unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage). We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to any failure to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov/
. European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding U.S. privacy practices should contact us at
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
, or can follow the process set forth below in the section titled “What if I have questions, concerns, or complaints?”.
What if I have questions, concerns or complaints?
If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message to
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles specified above (where applicable), we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information. We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield-related complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, you may contact or visit JAMS by visiting www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint, at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for residual claims about whether we have violated our obligations to you under the Privacy Shield, and if that violation remains fully or partially un-remedied.
Will Three Swords share any of the Personal Information it receives?
We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described below:
Information that’s been de-identified.
We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal user experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual. Google Inc.’s (“Google”) ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your use of the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at
www.google.com/privacy_ads.html
or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/
.
Advertisers:
We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
We may also deliver a file to you through the Website (known as a “web beacon” or “pixel tag”) from third parties (e.g., Facebook). Web beacons allow third parties to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we don’t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.
Affiliated Businesses:
We occasionally partner with third parties that offer applications that you may also be interested in using. We will advertise any such applications through the App, but you have a choice as to whether to download and use those applications. If you choose to download any third-party applications, we will share your Personal Information (e.g., IDFAs) with that third party only to the extent that it is necessary for you to use the third-party application and to measure the effectiveness of the joint advertising campaign. We have no control over the policies and practices of third parties as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to download and use any third-party applications, please review all relevant terms and policies posted by those third parties.
Our Agents:
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we use third parties for customer support functions, hosting services, mobile ad mediation services, ad networks, and analytics services. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Please click here for a list of vendors, third-party service providers and agents who provide us services and with whom we share Personal Information.
Business Transfers:
We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
Protection of Three Swords and Others:
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our
Terms of Use
and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Three Swords, our employees, our users, or others.
Is Personal Information about me secure?
A fundamental principle of data protection and security at Three Swords is to store only the types of Personal Information about a user that are deemed necessary and will be used with high frequency. Personal Information that is no longer needed is removed from our servers. This narrows the breadth of protection of Personal Information quite significantly as we store very little Personal Information about our users that necessitates protection. That being said, while we store as little Personal Information as possible, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of Personal Information at any time.
In order to protect your Personal Information, we have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All Personal Information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. All transactions, regardless of their nature, are encrypted using industry standard SSL technology.
What Personal Information can I access?
All individuals have the right to access the data we have about them. We will take reasonable steps to enable individuals, either directly or in connection with Partners, to correct, amend, or delete personal data that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. If you have any questions about viewing or updating the information we have on file about you, please contact us at
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
.
Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
.
What choices do I have?
You can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.
You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to take advantage of some of our features.
If you delete the App, some information may remain in our records after your deletion. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
What if I have questions about this policy?
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
, and we will try to resolve your concerns.

GDPR Privacy Notice
Privacy Policy
If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.
For this GDPR Privacy Notice, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.
Where applicable, this GDPR Privacy Notice is intended to supplement, and not replace, our Privacy Policy at
https://three-swords.com/privacy-policy/
(the “Privacy Policy”). If there are any conflicts between this GDPR Privacy Notice and our
Privacy Policy
, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this notice or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at threeswords.studio@gmail.com.
We Collect, Use, Share and Otherwise Process Personal Data:
We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include the following:
Legitimate Business Interest:
We process Personal Data when we believe it furthers our legitimate business interests or the legitimate business interests of third parties. These legitimate business interests include:
Operation and improvement of our business, products and services
Marketing our products and services
Provision of customer support
Protection from fraud or security threats
Completion of corporate transactions
Provision of personalized services
Consent:
In some cases, we may need to process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such Personal Data. If we need to process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.
Contractual Necessity:
We may need to process Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the Personal Data to perform under our
Terms of Service
with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services. If we need to process Personal Data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such Personal Data.
What Personal Data Do We Collect From You and How Do We Use Your Personal Data?
We collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners or service providers provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Services.
Information we collect directly from you:
We receive Personal Data directly from you when you provide us with such Personal Data, which may include:
First name
Last name
Email address
We may collect first name, last name, email address and any other Personal Data you provide if you email us at threeswords.studio@gmail.com. We have a legitimate business interest in providing customer support, so any Personal Data you provide in an email to us may be used in order to resolve your issues or generally answer your questions. Note, however, that while we will receive your email address if you email us at
threeswords.studio@gmail.com
, you do not need to provide your first or last name or any other Personal Data when you contact us, and we will not store any such Personal Data for longer than required to address your issues or concerns.
We may also collect Personal Data that you choose to provide through any voluntary surveys that we may send through the App about your experience with our Services, including gender and age. Providing your email address to us through these surveys is optional. We collect this Personal Data because we have a legitimate business interest in getting your feedback about the Services and improving your experience with the App.
Information we receive from third party sources:
Some third parties provide us with Personal Data about you, such as the following:
Account information for third party services:
If you interact with a third party service when using our Services, such as if you use a third party service to log in to our Services (i.e., Facebook), or if you share content from our Services through such third party service, the applicable third party service may send us your Personal Data (specifically your first name, ID, token and profile picture url) if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. The Personal Data we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the applicable third party service. We collect this Personal Data because we have a legitimate business interest in personalizing the Services. Specifically, this Personal Data permits us to create and manage user profiles and sync your progress when you connect to Facebook through the Services. It also allows us to surface your name on a leaderboard with any other Facebook friends that have also logged in to our Services through their Facebook accounts.
Information from other third parties:
We may access or receive Personal Data about you from some of our service providers (e.g., Helpshift, which provides customer support, or our payment processors) who assist us in providing our Services to you. We use this Personal Data because we have a legitimate business interest in addressing any customer support issues or addressing payment disputes. We do not request or otherwise access this Personal Data from our service providers unless there is a customer support issue or payment dispute.
Information from our advertising partners:
We receive Personal Data about you from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications.
Information we automatically collect when you use our Services:
Some Personal Data is automatically collected when you use our Services, such as the following:
IP address when you use the App (as part of conventional server log processing)
Device identifiers / Ad IDs (IDFA/IDFV)
Log data (e.g., access times, hardware and software information)
We collect these categories of Personal Data because we have a legitimate business interest in operating and improving our business, products and services; specifically, this Personal Data is used to conduct data analysis to better understand user preferences; protect against or deter fraudulent, illegal or harmful actions; enforce our
Terms of Service
; comply with our legal or contractual obligations; and personalize the Services. We also use “cookies” and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons and pixel tags) to collect Personal Data. Cookies allow us to recognize your browser or device and “remember” your browser during subsequent visits for purposes of functionality, preferences, and website performance, and they also tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. We do not use IP addresses, and we delete any IP addresses stored on our system every seven (7) days.
How and With Whom Do We Share Your Data?
We share Personal Data with vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this
Privacy Policy
or our
Terms of Service
. These parties include but may not be limited to:
Ad networks
Analytics service providers
Staff augmentation and contract personnel
Hosting service providers
Cloud service providers
Customer support
Mobile ad mediation services
Please click
here for a list of vendors, third-party service providers and agents
who provide us services and with whom we share Personal Data.
If we partner with third parties that offer applications that you may also be interested in using and you choose to download and use those third-party applications, we will share your Personal Information (e.g., IDFAs) with that third party only to the extent that it is necessary for you to use the third-party application and to measure the effectiveness of the joint advertising campaign. We have no control over the policies and practices of third parties as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to download and use any third-party applications, please review all relevant terms and policies posted by those third parties.
Furthermore, if we choose to buy or sell assets, user information (including Personal Data) is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information (including Personal Data) would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal Data with the party that is acquiring our assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.
Other Processing Grounds:
From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?
We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide the Services to you and improve the Services for all users generally. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.
Personal Data of Children:
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone in the EU under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us.

Advertising
Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses cookies in advertising
Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).
We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These
server logs
typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
Our advertising cookies
To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.
See more detail about the
types of cookies used by Google
and our partners and
how we use them
.
How you can control advertising cookies
You can use
ad settings
to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.
You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based
aboutads.info choices
page or the EU-based
Your Online Choices
.
Finally, you can
manage cookies in your web browser
.
Other technologies used in advertising
Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the
IP address
, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
Location
Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us.  Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:
Reset your device’s advertising ID
, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
Delete your device’s advertising ID
, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.
To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

Advertising identifiers for connected TV
Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.
The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:
Reset advertising ID
Delete advertising ID
Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
Your advertising ID (long string)
These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

Ads settings show up in one of two general paths for Android TV depending on the TV manufacturer/model. In Android TV, partners have the freedom to adapt the Settings path. It’s up to the partner which path they use to best fit their custom TV experience but below are the common paths to Ad settings.

Many connected TV devices support identifiers for advertising and offer ways for users to opt out of personalized advertising. A full list of those devices, and ways users can opt out, is kept updated on the Network Advertising Initiative’s website here:

What determines the ads by Google that I see?
Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.
Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.
Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.
The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.
You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.
Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.
We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.
