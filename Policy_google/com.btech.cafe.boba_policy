APPENDIX C - THIRD PARTY OPERATORS ON THE B-TECH GAMES
1. Information We Collect
We collect information about you and your use of the B-Tech Games.  Information about you may be required to provide you with the B-Tech Games. Your failure to provide such information may result in our inability to provide you with certain games, features, or services.
By downloading, accessing, and/or playing the B-Tech Games, you consent to the collection of information about you, by us.  Most of this data comes directly from you or your device, such as device information, your country and region, and game play information.  We use this data to provide our games and services to you, including for the purposes of optimizing our games, preventing fraud, customizing in-game offers, verifying purchases, and, with our third-party advertising partners, delivering to you targeted and/or contextual advertisements.
The information we collect falls into three categories:  (1) information collected directly from you; (2) information collected automatically, and (3) information collected from third parties.
(1) information collected directly from you
When you download our game, we may collect your age as indicated by you.
If you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email.
If you communicate with the B-Tech Games customer service team via email, we collect information you submit in the course of that communication, such as your contact information, the contents of emails you send us, support inquiries, or other feedback you provide directly to us.
Information you provide in game reviews and surveys
Purchase information, such as quantity and type of goods purchased, name of purchaser
Payment information for your purchase, which is securely processed by our third-party payment processor.
If you communicate with B-Tech through our presence on third party platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Discord, we collect information about the communication, such as your “liking” of our page, content of your comments, or replies to our content.
Marketing preferences, such as records of your requests to opt out of marketing communications.
(2) information collected automatically
We use in-app analytical tools to collect unique user ID, IP address, device IDs, hardware or operating system based identifiers, identifiers we assign to your account, and other similar identifiers (collected from your device).
Information on your activity in the B-Tech Games (for example, your game progress or your interactions with in-game ads), Internet, gaming, or other electronic network activity information – such as information regarding your interaction with an advertisement (collected from your device).  Your gameplay records are stored in the cloud if you opt-in to Cloud Save on some games. In other games it is stored locally on your device depending on the ability to provide such an option by the Apple & Google Play platforms.
Your general geographic location (for example, country, state, or city), determined based on your IP address.
(3) information collected from third parties
B-Tech collects user information through the third-party advertising networks on the B-Tech Games.  This information includes your device ID, a unique advertising ID associated with your device, and your approximate geographic location.  For more information, see the “Advertising” section below.
If you use a third-party platform to connect with B-Tech Games, we collect third-party platform account information and information made public in connection with that service (including your name, profile picture, age range, gender, and your friends).  Please keep in mind that when you post information on a third-party site or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by this privacy policy and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through the B-Tech Games.
If you make in-app purchases, we collect your ZIP code or postal code and information regarding your virtual items or currency in the B-Tech Games, including the amount of the transaction and records of purchases you have made. Additional information about these transactions is provided in the “In-App Purchases” section below.

To contact you with updates about B-Tech Games (if you have subscribed to our newsletter).
To ensure consistency with local law and choices and controls that may be available to you.

To improve the B-Tech Games and user experiences and to increase the functionality of the B-Tech Games.
To monitor and analyze the B-Tech Games usage and trends and otherwise measure the effectiveness of the services.
Please see the “

3. How We Disclose Your Information
We may disclose your information outside B-Tech in the following circumstances:
When you allow us to disclose your information with another company, such as directing us to disclose your information with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites.
When we contract or partner with a third party to provide services on our behalf, including B-Tech Games development and maintenance. These parties provide a variety of services to us, including, without limitation, order processing, billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services.
When we disclose information with third parties in connection with the sale of all or part of the B-Tech business.
To enforce our Terms of Use or rules, to ensure the safety and security of our users and third parties, to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of our users and third parties, address issues relating to security or fraud, to comply with legal process or in other cases if we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law.
As described in the “Advertising” section below.
If you consent, we may disclose your information publicly or to third parties, such as if you agree to provide a product or service review and have that content attributed to you.
When we disclose information with companies within the B-Tech corporate group who process your information in order to operate the B-Tech Games.  All related group companies may only use your information in accordance with this privacy policy.
Please note that once we disclose your information with another company in any of the circumstances set out above, the information received by the other company becomes subject to the other company’s privacy practices.  However, when companies perform services on our behalf, like customer service, we have agreements with those companies that govern their data practices and prohibit them from using your information for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law.
You may request a notice disclosing the categories of information we have disclosed to third parties, and the
names of those third parties
.  To request such notice, please contact <
help@honeybgames.com
data-preserve-html-node="true">.
Please see the “
Privacy for Children and Minors
” section below for more information on our sharing of information from children.
4. Advertising
B-Tech relies on advertising to fund the development and distribution of the B-Tech Games, most of which are available to play at no cost to you.  Accordingly, when you play the B-Tech Games you may see third-party advertising.  This advertising is delivered to the B-Tech Games by advertising networks that sell advertising to interested third parties.  Advertising networks collect a unique device ID or advertising ID (Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple devices and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”) on Android devices) that enables the delivery of advertisements that are relevant to you.  Your advertising ID is consistent across all apps and thus allows for cross-app tracking and interest-based advertising.  Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers uniquely associated with your device.  Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads.  These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognize your device when you use websites and applications.  Advertising networks may use your device’s IP address to determine your approximate geographic location to enable them to deliver more relevant advertisements.
Some B-Tech Games reward you with in-game currency (such as coins or gems) for watching advertisements (“Rewarded Ad”). If you are a California resident, please review the Incentive Program section in
Appendix A
.
Please see the “Your Controls and Choices” section, below, for information on how to limit advertising tracking.
We do not sell data on children (players under the age of 13) and minors (players under the age of 16).  Please see the “
Privacy for Children and Minors
” section below for more information on advertising to children.
5. In-App Purchases
Certain B-Tech Games may allow you to make In-App Purchases.  All In-App Purchases are processed by third party payment processors that may collect information directly from you (for example, they may request your billing address and credit card information) in accordance with its own privacy policy.  B-Tech’s third party payment processors do not disclose your financial information, like credit card number, with B-Tech.  We receive summary information about all purchases, including the amount of the transaction and your general location (such as your ZIP code).
6. Your Controls and Choices
We provide you the ability to exercise certain controls and choices regarding our collection, use, and sharing of your information.  In accordance with applicable law, you may be able to exercise certain rights with respect to the information we hold about you, including requesting access to that data or requesting that we amend or delete it.  You may exercise your controls and choices, or request access to your information, by contacting <

Rights Regarding Your Information
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right, in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws, to make requests related to your “personal information” or “personal data” (as such terms are defined under applicable law, and collectively referred to herein as “personal information”). Specifically, you may have the right to ask us to:
Tell you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we disclose personal information.
Provide you access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.
Correct or update personal information we hold about you.
Delete certain personal information we have about you.
Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.
Restrict or object to certain uses of your information.
Opt you out of the processing of your personal information for purposes of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, if applicable.
Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you. We also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address.  If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests.
You may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising” as described below. If you are a California resident, please see the
Appendix A
below for more information about our privacy practices and your rights.
As provided in applicable law, you also have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights.
To exercise any of these rights, you can contact <
help@honeybgames.com
data-preserve-html-node="true">.
You may be able to designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.
Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. We will provide information about how to exercise that right in our response denying the request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
(3)
Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information and Processing/Sharing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”
As explained in the “
How We Disclose Your Information
” and “
Advertising
” sections above, we sometimes disclose information to unaffiliated third parties we collaborate with or that provide offers that we think may be of value to you. We also provide information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing the use of our services and our user/customer base. Under certain laws, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt out of the disclosure of your personal information for these, please visit the following link: “
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
.” Because opt out requests are tied to your device ID, please note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit such requests on your behalf. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
7. Privacy for Children and Minors
B-Tech applies special protections for its younger players’ data.  For applications that are directed towards children and minors, B-Tech does not collect your information for profiling, targeted advertising, or geolocation tracking and we use the limited information we do collect to support our internal operations.
For applications that are directed at users age 16 and up, B-Tech has implemented age-screens to verify the age of players.  When you download our game, we collect your age as indicated by you.  We provide a separate experience for younger users through which we collect limited information and serve contextual advertising only.  In that gaming experience, there will be no profiling, targeted advertising, or geolocation tracking, and we use the limited information we do collect to support our internal operations.  A list of third party operators on the B-Tech Games can be found in
Appendix C
.
B-Tech collects data on children (players under the age of 13) and minors (players under the age of 16) only when necessary:
To deliver the game and access network features.
To serve contextual advertising, as noted above.
To provide you with the products and services you request.
B-Tech may use this data for the following purposes because these purposes are in B-Tech’s legitimate business interests:
To maintain and analyze game functioning.
To detect, investigate and prevent actions to ensure legal and regulatory compliance.
To protect the security and integrity of our users and B-Tech Games.
We work only with selected ad networks that respect the tag-for-child-directed (TFCD) parameter—aka the ‘COPPA flag’—on a per-app or per-request basis, so that interest-based advertising is switched off, and personal data collection is restricted.  In addition, these ad networks are able to categorize and tag their ad creatives by age, so that the ads are appropriate content-wise.
If B-Tech discovers that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a child under 13 years of age, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal information from our records.
If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 13 (or a minor under 16) who uses the B-Tech Games, please contact us at <
help@honeybgames.com
data-preserve-html-node="true">, if you have any questions or comments. If you are a parent or guardian, you may review the information we have collected from your child or ask us to make no further use of, or delete, such information. We may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.
8. Data Security and Integrity
The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your information are important to us.  We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification.  Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We will retain your information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for legitimate business purposes, or as provided by law.
9. Data Retention
The length of time for which we retain your information depends on the purposes for which we collect it and use it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our services) and the length of time thereafter during which we may have a legitimate need to reference your information to address issues that may arise;
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or,
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations)
We will delete and/or aggregate your information after the retention period ends.
10. Data Transfers, Storage and Processing Globally
Pursuant to our contract with you to provide you with the B-Tech Games, your information will be processed on servers that may not be located where you live, including on our servers hosted in the United States.  Users outside the United States should be advised that through your continued use of the B-Tech Games, which are governed by U.S. law, this privacy policy, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your information to the United States and (where applicable) you consent to that transfer.  No matter where our servers are located, we take appropriate measures to safeguard your rights in accordance with this privacy policy.
11. Changes to this Privacy Policy
From time to time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements, or for other purposes.  If we make any material changes to this privacy policy, we will post the updated privacy policy here and notify our users. Please check this page frequently to see any updates or changes to this privacy policy.

However, CCPA defines “sale” very broadly. It includes the sharing of CCPA Covered Information (by a covered business) in exchange for anything of value.  According to this broad definition, in the year before the date this policy was issued, for some B-Tech Games we collected, and may have sold, only the following categories of information for non-children and non-minor users:
Unique and online identifiers – IP address, device IDs, or other similar identifiers (collected from your device);
Internet, gaming, or other electronic network activity information – such as browsing history, search history, and information regarding an individual’s interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement (collected from your device); and
Location information – for example, if you access our games on your mobile device our advertisers may derive information about location from your IP address.
We may share the information with recipients such as our service providers to achieve these business purposes. This means that we may disclose the categories of personal information listed above for a business purpose.

Incentive Programs (California Residents Only)
The Services may offer opportunities to receive certain services or benefits such as discounts or free or extended services (such as bonus game time or additional credits), which may require the provision of personal information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable law (each, an “Incentive Program”).  When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program (e.g., by opting out of emails or terminating a service). To the extent we can determine the value of your information, we consider the value to you (and costs to us) of providing you with a discount, as compared to the value to us in an opportunity to gain a loyal, or even more loyal, customer; we seek to reasonably relate the benefits to you to the costs to us.
Sensitive Personal Information
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes.   In the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.

About Us
ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“ironSource Mobile”) operates 4 main services:
Ad Network
– A platform that allows app developers to serve ads within their apps, and advertisers to promote their products, and services within apps.
Mediation Platform
– A platform that helps app developers to manage all the ad providers with which they have a direct relationship (e.g. ironSource Mobile ad network, “third party” ad networks, additional online advertising companies, etc.) that serve ads on their apps.
Analytics Platform –
A platform that allows app developers to receive insights on their apps.
Ad Quality Platform
–
A platform that allows app developers to monitor advertising content displayed within their apps.
In addition, as of November 2022, Unity Technologies has been added as a corporate affiliate of ironSource Mobile Ltd. To view Unity’s privacy policy, please click
here
We collect information in either of 2 ways:
Directly
– through our SDKs integrated by app developers in their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information directly from such apps.
Indirectly
– through other third party mediation platforms with which we engage in order to serve ads in apps, or by receiving information from our advertisers, or affiliates.
Scope:
This privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with respect to information it processes through its Ad Network, Mediation Platform, Analytics Platform and Ad Quality Platform. This privacy policy does not govern the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for advertisers.
ironSource Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connetecuit and Utah, please see “State Privacy Rights” section of this privacy policy for information related to privacy laws in these states.
Information We Collect:
Information collected through our Ad Network (“Ad Network Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, and a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”), or . The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising companies to recognize a device across apps, for advertising purposes. You can find additional information about how to limit our use of the Advertising ID under “How to Control Your Information”.
General technical information about a device: Technical information such as the device’s time zone, the amount of free memory on the device, the name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status, operating system name and version,  the language of the operating system, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection type (e.g. WiFi), etc.
Campaign information: An indication if an ad was viewed, or clicked, or if there was an install of an advertised app. Information about actions performed within an advertiser’s app following such an install, such as in-app purchases, and level in the game (if the advertiser chooses to provide such information).
Information collected through our Mediation Platform (“Mediation Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer.
General technical information as described above.
Data provided by the app developers (if they choose to provide it) – The app developer can choose to share with us the following information: age, gender, in-app purchases, advance in the game, and such other information provided by the app developer.
Information collected by our Analytics Platform (“Analytics Information”)
Identifiers: a self-created ID unique to a specific app.
App events: Events set by the app developer that occurred within the app.
General technical data about the device.
Information collected by our Ad Quality Platform (“Ad Quality Information”)
Identifiers: a self-created ID unique to a specific app.
Advertising content: The ads displayed within the app, and interactions with such ads.
General technical data about the device.
How We Use the Information We Collect:
As stated above, we provide 4 main services. For each such service, we use the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general description of how we use information across our services:
Operating our Ad Network
– We use Ad Network Information to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting, billing and attribution: We use Ad Network Information to generate reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Network Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud detection and prevention: We use Ad Network Information for detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.
Optimization and frequency capping: We use Ad Network Information for optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of ads you view in a specific app.
Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in, or from their advertising campaigns.
Operating our ad marketplace. We use Ad Network Information to allow the third party advertising companies listed
here
to bid on ad inventory.
Operating our Mediation Platform
– We use Mediation Information to operate our mediation platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our mediation platform in order to allow them to better understand their audience in terms of interaction with ads.
Segmentation: We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content of the ads served by different networks.
Sending ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network Information.
Operating our Analytics Platform
– We use Analytics Information to operate our Analytics Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Analytics Platform in order to allow them to better understand the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Analytics Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Operating our Ad Quality Platform
– We use Ad Quality Information to operate our Ad Quality Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Ad Quality Platform in order to allow them to see which ads were served within their apps, and how such ads affected the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Quality for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.

9. Protection for Minors
Mintegral’s service is not mainly for minors. If a User is deemed as minor under applicable law, please make sure that before the use of the application which integrates Mintegral’s product or service or the application of an advertiser that partners with Mintegral for delivering its ads, parents or other guardian and such User have together read the application’s privacy policy with the guardianship and guiding of parents or other guardian, and their consent have been provided for processing of personal information.
We process minor’s personal information according to requirements of related laws and regulations. Except as otherwise provided by law, we will only collect, use, store, disclose, or make available to the public the personal information where permitted by law, with consent of parents or other guardians, or for the necessity of protection of the minors. If we notice the collection of personal information of minors without verifiable consent of parents, we will take measures to delete related information as soon as possible.
If you are parents or other guardian of minors, please contact us via the email we provide in this Policy when you have any question regarding to the protection of minors.
If you are Users in the U.S., we ensure that we comply with COPPA. If our business partners (such as Publishers) operate apps directed to children under the age of thirteen (13) or knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information of children under the age of thirteen (13) during our cooperation, they will obtain verifiable parental consent for Mintegral to collect, use or disclose such personal information according to this Policy. Further, such business partners must enable the COPPA settings when using the Mintegral Services. This allows Mintegral to ensure that any persistent identifiers collected about Users of apps that are flagged as “child-directed” will be processed according to the requirements of COPPA, including not being used to serve behaviorally-targeted ads or track users for such purposes in violation of COPPA. In addition, we will not knowingly collect any other personal information (such as the precise geo-location of Users’ devices) from Users of Apps that we know to be directed to children under the age of thirteen (13).
If you are Users in California U.S.,we ensure that we comply with CCPA. We will not sell or conduct targeted advertising with the data of consumers under the age of 16, unless there is explicit opt-in consent. If the request for consent is declined, we will not ask again for 12 months. Minors under the age of 13 must get permission from a parent or guardian to opt-in.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should promptly contact us and we take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.
