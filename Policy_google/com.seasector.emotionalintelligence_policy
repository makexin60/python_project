In the future, Sintelly may partner with organizations to conduct research studies or provide you with the Services through separate programs. Potential program partners may include employers, hospitals, providers, or other medical and academic partners.

We never share your transcripts with Sintelly without your consent, even de-identified.
e. Disclosures to Protect Us or Others

Protect you, us, or others’ rights, property, or safety
Enforce our policies or contracts
Assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity
f. Transferring Personal Data Outside of the Country
Your personal data may be transferred, stored, and processed in one or more countries outside of the country you reside in or are currently located, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you reside or are currently located. When processing personal data outside of the country you reside in or are currently located, we take additional steps in an effort to ensure our international transfer of personal data is consistent with applicable law.
If we transfer personal data that originates in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support such transfer is the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
If you have additional questions about our international transfers of personal data, please contact info@sintelly.com.
g. Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Asset Transfers
If Sintelly is involved in a merger, acquisition, financial due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.
Data Protection
Sintelly uses commercially reasonable efforts to implement security measures designed to avoid accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access to personal data. These measures may include (as appropriate):
Adherence to organization-level security policies and procedures to safeguard sensitive user data, complying with the applicable privacy and security regulations, including relevant privacy and security rules
Using cloud-enabled infrastructure designed to reduce our data footprint
Encrypting all personal data at rest and in transit
Securing sensitive personal data in a dedicated environment in a manner designed to ensure segregation and clear access control
Using technical network controls like multi-factor authentication and deny-all/allow-by-exception in a manner designed to maintain controlled access
Conducting and responding to penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, code reviews, and internal compliance reviews
Maintaining our business continuity, disaster recovery, and incident response plans
Allowing employees to access personal data only if required in connection with their job duties
Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect, and no method of data transmission or storage is guaranteed to prevent unauthorized disclosure or misuse. As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss of personal data.
