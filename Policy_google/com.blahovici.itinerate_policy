About forwarding reservations to Itinerate - versions 8.0 and above only
It is now possible to forward email reservations to a custom generated email address. This will import the reservation directly into the target trip.
Itinerate only stores the reservation data within the trip data. However, in some cases, I require the use of an artificial intelligence API to extract the reservation information.
Itinerate uses the OpenAI api for reservation extraction. The user data is sent through an API request to OpenAI. According to their privacy policy, they do not train their models with API request input data. They only maintain data on their servers for 30 days. For more information, read the privacy policy linked above.
About importing content from user Gmail accounts - versions 7.4.1 and below only
You can now import reservations directly from Gmail, upon request. To use this feature, you must login with your Google account and grant read-only access to your Gmail messages.
Itinerate will only read emails between two dates that you specify. Reservations do not sync automatically. You must synchronize manually every time you want to import new reservations.
Itinerate only reads standard embedded email markup formatted by businesses. Absolutely no personal content will be stored in any way. The only content that will be stored in our secure Firebase servers is the markup data and/or reservation data added by businesses in their respective emails. This data will be used to augment the travel planning experience, and allow users to place their reservations where they choose in their trip timeline and/or destination pin board.
About translated results - disclaimer
This service may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.
Some app results may be translated for your convenience using translation software powered by Google Translate. Reasonable efforts have been made to provide an accurate translation, however, no automated translation is perfect nor is it intended to replace human translators. Translations are provided as a service to users of Itinerate, and are provided as is. No warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, is made as to the accuracy, reliability, or correctness of any translations made from english into any other language. Some content may not be accurately translated due to the limitations of the translation software.
The official text is the English version of the app. Any discrepancies or differences created in the translation are not binding and have no legal effect for compliance or enforcement purposes. If any questions arise related to the accuracy of the information contained in the translated website, refer to the english version of the website which is the official version.

Security
I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.

Advertisements
In our app, we display advertisements mediated through Applovin Max, which incorporates networks such as Google AdMob, Meta Audience Network, AppLovin, and InMobi. These platforms help serve relevant and tailored ads to enhance your experience. Here's how:
Data Collected
: The advertising platforms, including AdMob, Meta Audience Network, AppLovin, and InMobi, may collect information such as your device's advertising identifier, IP address, and device information. This data helps in delivering targeted and pertinent ads to improve your app experience.
Usage
: The collected data ensures that the ads displayed are relevant to your interests, facilitates reporting to advertisers, and avoids showing you repetitive ads.
Your Choices
: If you prefer, you can opt-out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device's ad settings. If you'd rather not see any ads, we offer an option to purchase an in-app product to remove the banner ads.
Third-Party Policies
: Each advertising platform has its own set of policies and principles to ensure a positive user experience. Please consult the privacy policy of each advertising platform individually for more information.
In-App Purchases
Our app offers in-app purchases. Specifically, users can purchase an option to remove banner ads:
Transaction Data
: When you make an in-app purchase, certain transaction details may be accessible to us such as your purchase date and the item purchased. However, we do not handle or store payment information like credit card numbers. Payment transactions are processed through the respective app platform's payment system (e.g., Google Play).
Usage of Purchase Information
