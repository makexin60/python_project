We protect your personal information via appropriate security safeguards.

				this Privacy Policy, and applicable law.
PRIVACY POLICY
Welcome to Sweet Snap Lite’s Privacy Policy. (“Sweet Snap Lite”, “we”, “us” or “our”). Thank you for taking the time to read it.
(1) We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making
				sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information.
				This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
(2) This Privacy Policy applies beginning May 25, 2018. The previous version of this Privacy Policy, will apply until
				then.
(3) EFFECTIVE DATE: May 25, 2018
1. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES
This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by Sweet Snap Lite. For simplicity, we refer
				to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy
				on all applicable services.
Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that
				policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic
			profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services,
			for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social
			media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
1) Information we receive from others
In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:
• Other Users
Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about
						you from other users if they contact us about you.
• Other Partners
We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Sweet Snap Lite ads are published on a partner’s websites
						and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).
2) Information collected when you use our services
When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices
				you use to access our services. See below for more details:
• Usage Information
We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g. date and time you logged
						in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address,
						advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time
						and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).
• Device Information.
We collect information about your device, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device
						identifiers (including MAC address and IMEI), browser type and language, mobile device phone number, and mobile network
						information. We also collect certain device information that will help us diagnose problems in the (hopefully rare)
						event you experience any crash or other problem while using our Services. So, for example, if we detect a crash or
						other problematic event, we may collect the list of apps on your device and other information about your device’s performance
						at the time of the event for troubleshooting purposes.
• Camera and Photos.
Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. We’ll
						access your camera and photos only after you give us your consent.
• Read the Contents of SD Card
Read, Modify or delete the contents of your SD card as your instructions. We use this permission so that you can save
						new pictures to your SD card.
3. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES
Like most online services, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Cookies are small data files stored on
			your hard drive or in device memory that store information about your use of the Services, which authenticating you, remembering
			your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising
			campaigns, allowing you to use social features. Web beacons are small pieces of software on a webpage or email that help
			us see how you interact with that webpage or email. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer,
			you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Keep in mind, though, that removing or
			rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information
			sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us
			in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other users so
			that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
And we use third-party advertising agencies to place advertisements on the Internet or in other media. To measure the effectiveness
			of the advertisements and determine how much to pay to the advertising agencies, we install third-party modules within
			the App. We may also install third-party modules within the App in order to help us understand how the Service is used.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that
			tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a
			DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s
			user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including
			Sweet Snap Lite, do not currently respond to DNT signals.

1) With other users
• You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public
					profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable
					being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.

					securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.
• We may also share information with other Sweet Snap Lite businesses for legitimate business purposes such as corporate audit,
					analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws. We may also share user information with

					personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances.
• We may also share this information with other Sweet Snap Lite businesses and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and
					deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report
					on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information
					in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources.
6. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS
Sharing of information laid out in Section 4 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United
			States of America and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service allows for users to be located in the European
			Economic Area (“EEA”), their personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA.
7. YOUR RIGHTS
You have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing
			of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured,
			machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this data to another controller.
In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t 
			have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing).
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or
			if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.
To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us - or our data protection officer - using the details set
			out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU data protection authority where you
			live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.
8. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information.
			As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should
			not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.
We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection,
			storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.
We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If
			you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately.
9. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
Where we process registration data, we do this for as long as you are an active user of our sites and for 12 months after
			this.
Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop
			and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you
			have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your request in future.
Where we process personal data in connection with performing a contract, we keep the transactional data for six years from
			your last interaction with us (or such longer period as may be required by law).
Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines,
			we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due to technical constraints.
10. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
If you are a minor, you shall use our services with obtaining prior consent of your parent or legal guardian (collectively,
			"guardian"). We recommend that the guardians of minors shall read this Policy carefully, and we also recommend minors
			to obtain guardians’ prior consent and guidance before submitting personal information in your use of our services.
Sweet Snap Lite respects the privacy of children under the terms of COPPA. We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information
			from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service. The Service and its content
			are not directed at children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information
			from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe
			that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us via sweetsnaplite.online@gmail.com.
11. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
Sweet Snap Lite may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically. We may provide you
			additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of Sweet Snap Lite
			or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.
