Wellness App Privacy Policy
Effective date: October 14, 2021, revised 9/22
THIS APP DOES NOT COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION.
CORDICO INC. (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates this mobile application (the “Service” and the “app”).
Because of the sensitive nature of this app, we have designed this app so that no personal data (i.e., name, contact information, contacts) is collected. Although the app does not capture personal data, there are instances when the app provides external resources with distinct privacy policies where your personal information could be collected. Specifically:
Emails
In some situations when utilizing the app, you will have the ability to tap to email an individual or organization (e.g., a peer support member or chaplain). In those situations, your email editor or email application will launch and you will have ability to send an email. When sending an email, you are outside the app. We highly recommend that you do not send any information that you are not comfortable sharing with the recipient or others.
Phone Numbers and Calls
When utilizing certain app features, you may have the ability to tap a phone number to call an individual or organization (e.g., a therapist, chaplain or peer support member). In those situations, the call is completed outside the app and through your mobile device dialer. Your call information is
not
collected or stored by the app. The listing of any contact information within the app for your use is
not
connected in any way to your contact lists or digital address books and utilizing such features does not grant additional access or permissions to data stored on your device.
Mapping Applications
In some situations when utilizing the app, you will have the ability to tap to get directions to a facility or office. When this occurs, you are outside the app.
Personal Information Contained Within the App
When utilizing certain app features, you may be able to view and access the personal contact information of peer support personnel and chaplains available to your organization. This information is voluntarily made available by those resources and is not linked to you in any way. You will not be asked to add, upload, or input your own personal contact information within the app at any time.
Third Party Websites, Applications, or Service Providers
The App allows you to visit external websites (typically via hyperlink), applications, or service providers. If you click on a third-party link, you may be directed to that third party’s own application, website, or content.
In addition, we utilize certain third-party services for data management, hosting, and for App functionality. The list below includes third parties whose services are available for use within our current App offering, but we do not utilize any third-party service to monitor or track individual end-users, nor do we utilize any software, code, backend features, or tools that would in any way detract from our commitment to anonymity for App end users.
Third-Party Services:
IgniteTech: content management, hosting, and support (via BiznessApps)
For business analytics, IgniteTech may also identify other IngniteTech applications installed on an end-user’s mobile device (if any). This information is not connected to individual app usage and does not impact or affect other applications on the device.
Recurly: subscription management system
Spreedly: payment service orchestrator
Braintree: online payment solution
Google:
Cloud API: youtube, calendar, events, cloud print
Firebase: Android and PWA push notifications
Play Store: publishing Android apps
Maps
Apple iTunes: publishing iOS apps
Mailgun: sending transactional emails
MacStadium: iMac instances that host streamers and both iOS and iOS Enterprise app builders
While we remain committed to end-user anonymity, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every website, application, or service provider you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party websites, applications, or services, and specifically disclaim any liability related to the same.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
We will let you know via a notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the “effective date” at the top of this Privacy Policy.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

The categories of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.

Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
Exercising Access and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by:
Emailing us at
privacy@lexipol.com
or by calling us toll-free at 844-312-9500.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, can make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
You can only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For access requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
You can also submit a request via the
