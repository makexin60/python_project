Planet Search Privacy Policy
What information about all visitors is collected and stored on our site?
We respect your privacy, and to maximize your confidentiality, we collect a minimal amount of information – only your email in the case of a premium subscription. Email is necessary for the client to use the VPN on 10 different devices with just one subscription. We do not request or store your name, IP address, physical address, phone number, or other personal information. Payments are processed through reliable payment gateways that use a secure connection. We do not retain any details of payments in our system. Subscription renewals are accomplished by assigning a unique ID to each account.
What information do we collect and store when you register in our VPN service?
We collect as little information as possible to maximize your privacy, only your email needed. The email is required for the client can use the VPN on 10 different devices using only one subscription. We do not store and collect your name, IP address, real address, phone number or other personal information. Payments go through secure payment gateways using a secure connection. We do not store any payment details in our system. The subscription is updated by assigning a unique id to each account.
What information is recorded while clients are connected to our VPN service?
We keep a non-permanent connection log to address technical issues, including the random generation of names and internal assignment of an IP address (private IP address), which is securely deleted every few hours. We strictly and purposefully do not record any more information to mitigate our legal responsibility. To optimise network connection, information about a specific device, such as OS version, device model, and IP address, is displayed in our system only temporarily, exclusively while you are using it and is neither stored nor transmitted. After closing the application, all the information mentioned above becomes inaccessible to anyone. We do not use files, trackers, or other analytical tools to monitor your usage or behaviour. We only use necessary permissions and resources for the uninterrupted and secure operation of our application. We also do not track your browser activity and do not keep any records. This is simply impossible with our internal interface. All data about the use of the service is anonymous and not tied to your real, public IP address.
Planet VPN uses Google ADMob advertising services to deliver ads to users of their free VPN products. These services collect information related to ad delivery, such as:
1. Website or app where the ad was delivered: This helps them understand where their ads are being shown and measure their effectiveness.
2. Device-specific information: This can include device type, operating system, and other technical details that help optimize ad delivery and display.
3. Google ADMob advertising companies may collect information about your visit to Planet VPN websites and apps: This is done using cookies and other tracking technologies, allowing them to tailor ads to your interests when you browse other websites or use other apps.
4. Planet VPN may use third-party as Google ADMob advertising services to personalize ads based on matched email addresses or other personal information: This enables them to target their marketing efforts to existing or potential customers.
You can choose whether to allow data tracking when you first launch our app. A consent window will appear, giving you the option to reject or accept data monitored or filtration.
What happens if you receive a proper notice (for example, DMCA) about copyright infringement for the downloaded material?
Since our customers are anonymous during the use of the service, such notification will be sent to freevpnplanet.com, and our legal department will send an appropriate response. Since we do not store logs (records) of the connection, we can not link the request to the client’s identity, even if we are legally forced to do this.
How do we act when authorities ask us the information about a client?
Our company is registered in Romania. If we receive a court order from an authorized person whose jurisdiction extends to freevpnplanet.com, our company is obliged to comply with this order. Nevertheless, the company cannot be forced to provide data that is not possessed by company. When a user registers, we request a minimum of information – only a valid email. If it becomes possible at the legislative level to compel us to keep records about the connections of our customers or collect any personal data about the activity on the Internet, we will immediately notify our users and do everything in our power to change jurisdiction or close. Our service protects those who have trusted us with their privacy.
Changes to Privacy Policy
The service freevpnplanet.com reserves the right to make changes to the stated rules of the privacy policy at any time. In such cases, we will take all reasonable measures to ensure that such changes are brought to your attention – by publishing all changes prominently on the freevpnplanet.com website for a reasonable period before the new policy takes effect, and by notifying all existing clients via email. We aim to protect your privacy and provide you with an excellent user experience. If you have any questions or comments regarding the stated rules, please feel free to contact us at

When you use our Software & Services, certain types of information are automatically collected and stored. These include:
Online Identifiers: The Software & Services do not collect personally identifying information or attempt to process data that could result in such identification. However, certain features may generate an online identifier that associates a user with a device. This identifier can be an installation ID, cookie ID, or IP address.
Device and Technical Information: We collect technical information about your device and how you use the Software & Services. This includes device type, operating system version, IP address, anonymous user identifiers (such as cookies), Software & Services version, and device configuration and settings.

Support Related Information: If you contact us for support through our support section or email, we may collect your email address, name, and any information you voluntarily provide in connection with your support request.
Please note that our primary intention is not to personally identify or contact you through the collected data, except for registration and user support purposes as outlined in this Privacy Policy. However, the collected data may include personally identifiable information or personal data as defined by applicable laws. For example, if you enter a search term that includes personal information, it may be included in the collected data. Additionally, when you visit a partner's website that uses our Software & Services, your IP address and other online identifiers may be automatically transferred to us. Not providing such information may impact our ability to provide certain elements of the Software & Services.
We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your information responsibly. For more details on how we use and safeguard your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

Some of the Software & Services may include content provided by third parties, such as apps, buttons, gadgets, advertisements, websites, products, and services (referred to as "Third Party Content and Services").

It is important to note that we do not review, approve, monitor, endorse, or make any representations regarding such Third Party Content and Services.

For instance, individuals under 13 years old in the United States and under 16 years old in the European Union are not allowed to access or use the Software & Services. We do not knowingly collect, use, share, or disclose personal information from minors. We may request proof of age to ensure that minors are not using the Software & Services.
We recommend that parents and guardians regularly monitor their children's online activities, including email and other communications. There are third-party tools and services available that can help create a safer online environment for children. If we become aware that a minor is using the Software & Services, we will block their access and make efforts to delete any personal information related to that user.
If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided their personal information without your consent, please contact us as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We will take the necessary actions to remove that information from our database.

We have implemented and will continue to maintain appropriate security measures, policies, and procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
