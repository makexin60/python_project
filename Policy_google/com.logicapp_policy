Survey
We are conducting surveys in order to improve our services and you may freely decide whether you would like to help us or not. We will always ask for your consent before conducting a survey.
From time to time we may conduct an in-app survey and collect demographic and usage information for the purposes of internal analysis, marketing and brand development.

We might collect the following information: age and gender of the user of an app, whether another person uses the app, the age and gender of the people regularly using the app, assessment of popularity of the main character, which of the characters are known to the user, which app is most commonly used, whether children under the age of 13 use the app on their own or with an adult, the gender of users playing the game, different ways of using the app, an assessment of the features of an application, the time period of using the application, what would make the app more appealing, and other information needed for the purposes of internal analysis, marketing and brand development.

These providers may use the data collected from the survey and Tag Data on anonymized and aggregated bases together with the data from other partners (”Unified Data”) to publish syndicated reports on internet behavior and trends. If you wish to opt out from conducting an in-app survey, do not click on the survey button or decline to answer the survey questions.

Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer or mobile device. They contain information about your browsing activity. Whenever you visit the Massiana's website, it sends a cookie to the device you are using to access the website. Your device may automatically store the cookie in a file that is located within your web browser. When you revisit the Massiana's site, it will respond in a more personalized way, remembering your preferences. The latter is possible due to the corresponding cookies.
Massiana's website uses cookies to improve the performance of the site and the user experience it delivers. We use necessary and third-party cookies. Necessary cookies are designed by Massiana, and third-party cookies - by the companies whose services we use in the Massiana's website and app. We will expand on each category of cookies below.
How does Massiana use cookies?
Massiana employs cookies of two types: session and persistent. Session cookies are temporary; they disappear when you leave the site or exit your browser. Persistent cookies remain in a cookie file on your device over the given time. Both types of cookies are used to enable the smooth and failure-free performance of Massiana's website and app. Cookies speed up page loads, enable requests for service, help automatically recognize you, enable safe connection, and many more. Session cookies help us understand your preferences when interacting with the site. Persistent cookies work for statistics and analytics, help us see a bigger picture of what is important to you on the web.
Necessary Cookies
Massiana designs necessary cookies by themselves. These cookies are used by the Massiana's website. They help the site identify you as a user, authorize your logging into the site, block suspicious attempts to reach users' personal data, and bar using them for malicious purposes. Some necessary cookies track your browsing history and the use of apps. With due analyzes of these data, we are able to identify the shortcomings of Massiana, and elaborate ways for improvement. This is, for example, how we understand the performance of the Massiana's app and website in various parts of the world, or how we diagnose bugs in the services we offer.
Third-Party Cookies
Massiana's website supports third-party cookies. These cookies further help us understand how you interact with our services - all for subsequent improvements thereof. Furthermore, for selected analyzes, we may also process other data that are collected by the third-party cookies. Some of the third-party cookies are marketing cookies. These help us show you relevant and timely announcements and notifications. We use marketing cookies by Google Analytics, Yandex Metrica, Facebook and Twitter. Statistical third-party cookies are used for analytical purposes: for example, performance analysis and business research. We use statistical cookies by Google Analytics, Segment and Branch.
How to manage and decline cookies
Most browsers will ask what you want to do with the cookies they use. We have collected a list of manuals (see below) on how to manage cookies in some most popular browsers.
• Google Chrome
• Internet Explorer
• Firefox
• Safari
• Opera
As a rule, the browser will display three alternatives whenever you land on the page: accept, decline or disable cookies. This may expand on all the cookies, third-party cookies or cookies from selected websites. Massiana's cookies, when declined, may limit the functionality of the Massiana website and app, which will result in some services and features getting unavailable.
Do-Not-Track Signals
The Massiana website and app may not interpret the Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals that your browser sends them. There is no consensus yet on how the companies one encounters while browsing should interpret DNT. Thereby we have refrained from the use of DNT considering the potential conflicts that may happen with some of the Massiana's features otherwise. Once there appears a universally-signed standard for what we should do when detecting a DNT signal, we will respond to the change appropriately.

The only personal information we collect from users who have identified themselves as below the age of digital consent according to EEA data protection legislation for the purposes of offering our services are persistent identifiers (such as User UDs, Device ID or IP address) and Child’s age category.
We do not share such persistent identifiers with third parties. They are used only to authenticate users of applications, to maintain or analyze the functioning of the application, to personalize the content of the application (or send push notifications), to perform network communications to protect the security or integrity of the user or the application, or to ensure legal or regulatory compliance. Child’s age category used to build a correct education plan (as we are required to do so by
Contractual Necessity
), its processed as a pseudonymized information (for example, ‘category A’ or ‘B’), so the date of birth could not be identified from it.
When using the persistent identifiers we will not contact users under the age of digital consent according to EEA data protection legislation, nor do any user tracking or profiling. For the detailed information about disclosure to third parties please see section 3 of this Privacy Policy. For any additional questions about third party information disclosure please contact us at

14. Cookies
Amplitude uses cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. Below we describe what cookies and web beacons are, why we use cookies and web beacons, the types of cookies and web beacons that we use, as well as what you can do in order to manage and delete cookies and web beacons.
What are cookies and web beacons?
Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors to their websites. A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to our Website. Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. The cookies can be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies are stored by a web browser and remain valid until a set expiration date. Session cookies only exist while your internet browser is open and are automatically deleted once you close your browser.
Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic files contained on pages of websites that permit companies to count users who have visited certain webpages on a website and are used for other related website statistics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
What does Amplitude
use cookies and web beacons for?
Amplitude uses a variety of cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies for different purposes. Specifically, Amplitude uses cookies and web beacons to enhance the experience of our visitors to our Website (for example, by remembering your preferences and letting you navigate between pages efficiently) and to better understand how the Website and Product are used. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Website before or whether you are a new visitor.
What types of cookies and web beacons are used by Amplitude?
Amplitude uses both first-party and third-party cookies and web beacons. First-party cookies and web beacons are cookies and web beacons that are served directly by Amplitude to your computer or mobile device. Third-party cookies and web beacons are served by a third-party service provider on behalf of Amplitude. Third-party cookies are most commonly used for advertising and analytics purposes.
There are four categories of cookies and web beacons used by Amplitude. Specifically, Amplitude uses essential, performance, functionality and advertising cookies and web beacons.
Essential cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies are necessary for the operation of the Website and Product. These tracking technologies enable you to move around on the Website and use the Website’s features. You may not opt-out of these types of cookies because they are required to operate the Website and Product.
Performance cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies collect information about how you have used the Website and Product. We use performance cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies to improve the user experience with our Website and Product.
Functionality cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies allow us to remember how you are logged into our Website, when you logged in or out and the actions you have taken while you have been logged into the Website.
Advertising cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies are used by our third-party service providers to deliver advertising to you on other third-party websites as well as help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. We also use these types of cookies to analyze Website visits and ad conversions from third-party websites.
