Welcome! We are Kick.com, a gaming livestreaming platform. Our goal is to create a creator-friendly streaming service for content creators.

4. Third party data collection and online advertising
We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third party services to collect information about your use of our Services over time so that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Services, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.
Please see the "Online ads and control over your information" section below, to learn how you can opt-out of interest-based advertising.
We may engage in the following:
Social media platforms: We may display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not wish to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.
Third party marketing partners:  We work with a variety of third party partners to provide advertising services. For example, we use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our Services on your browser, log in to your account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us. We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Services and to tailor our advertisements and content to you. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google's website, "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps" located at

7. Personal information of children
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. If an individual is under the age of 13, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child's parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal information.
8. Data collection technologies used in our emails
Our emails may contain tracking pixels that identify if and when you have opened an email that we have sent you, how many times you have read it, and whether you have clicked on any links in that email. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing email campaigns, make the emails we send to you more relevant to your interests, and understand if you have opened and read any important administrative emails we might send you.
Many popular email clients will allow you to block these pixels by disabling certain external images in emails. You can do this through the settings on your email client -- these generally give you the option of choosing whether emails will display "remote images", "remote content" or "images" by default.
Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and installing extensions that block pixels and other tracking technologies.
9. Storage, security and international transfers of your personal information
We store your personal information electronically.
Security. We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss and misuse and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please be aware that, despite taking every reasonable effort, no data security measures can ever guarantee security.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, logging off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your login credentials secret. To the extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any loss, cost, liability or expense incurred by you should you fail to do any of these things.
International transfers of your personal information. TThe personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in where we and our third party service providers have operations, including in the United States If you are accessing our Services from the European Economic Area ("EEA"), UK or Switzerland, your personal information will be processed outside of the EEA, the UK and Switzerland.

How long will we store your personal information?
We will usually store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, and in accordance with our legitimate business interests and applicable law. For example, if your personal information is subject to the EU GDPR or UK GDPR, the criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:
Contract. Where we are processing personal information is based on contract, we generally will retain your personal information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from our contractual relationship.
Legitimate interests. Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account your fundamental interests and your rights and freedoms.
Consent. Where we are processing personal information based on your consent, we generally will retain your personal information until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfil the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.
Legal Obligation. Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain your personal information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the legal obligation.
Legal claim. We may need to apply a "legal hold" that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim or intent to establish a claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information.
Recipients of personal information
We may share your personal information with third parties. For a detailed list of the categories of third parties, please visit the "Our disclosure of personal information" section of our Privacy Notice.
Legal bases for processing

4. Third party data collection and online advertising
We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third party services to collect information about your use of our Services over time so that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Services, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.
Please see the "Online ads and control over your information" section below, to learn how you can opt-out of interest-based advertising.
We may engage in the following:
Social media platforms: We may display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not wish to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.
Third party marketing partners:  We work with a variety of third party partners to provide advertising services. For example, we use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our Services on your browser, log in to your account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us. We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Services and to tailor our advertisements and content to you.

7. Personal information of children
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. If an individual is under the age of 13, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child's parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal information.
8. Data collection technologies used in our emails
Our emails may contain tracking pixels that identify if and when you have opened an email that we have sent you, how many times you have read it, and whether you have clicked on any links in that email. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing email campaigns, make the emails we send to you more relevant to your interests, and understand if you have opened and read any important administrative emails we might send you.
Many popular email clients will allow you to block these pixels by disabling certain external images in emails. You can do this through the settings on your email client -- these generally give you the option of choosing whether emails will display "remote images", "remote content" or "images" by default.
Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and installing extensions that block pixels and other tracking technologies.
9. Storage, security and international transfers of your personal information
We store your personal information electronically.
Security. We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss and misuse and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please be aware that, despite taking every reasonable effort, no data security measures can ever guarantee security.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, logging off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your login credentials secret. To the extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any loss, cost, liability or expense incurred by you should you fail to do any of these things.
International transfers of your personal information. TThe personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in where we and our third party service providers have operations, including in the United States If you are accessing our Services from the European Economic Area ("EEA"), UK or Switzerland, your personal information will be processed outside of the EEA, the UK and Switzerland.

We collect specific categories of personal information from you when you use our Services or from third parties. For a list of the categories of personal information and how we use it, please visit the "Our collection and use of personal information" section of our Privacy Notice.
We will indicate to you, at the point that we collect personal information from you, if the provision of certain personal information is mandatory or optional.

How long will we store your personal information?
We will usually store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, and in accordance with our legitimate business interests and applicable law. For example, if your personal information is subject to the EU GDPR or UK GDPR, the criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:
Contract. Where we are processing personal information is based on contract, we generally will retain your personal information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from our contractual relationship.
Legitimate interests. Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account your fundamental interests and your rights and freedoms.

Legal Obligation. Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain your personal information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the legal obligation.
Legal claim. We may need to apply a "legal hold" that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim or intent to establish a claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information.
Recipients of personal information

This may also include our
Terms of Use

Here, your consent is implied, meaning that you consent by submitting a particular form. We also rely on your consent for using cookies and other technologies on our website and here you explicitly agree to these.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users.

Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
