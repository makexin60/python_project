Privacy principles
Your privacy is important to us. This Online Privacy Policy explains what and how we collect, share, use, and protect your personal information when you visit or use this and other online services offered by the JPMorgan Chase & Co. family of companies (“J.P. Morgan”) that link to or reference this Policy (collectively, our “online services”). Contact details are provided below. Other privacy principles or policies could apply depending on how you interact with us, the financial products or services you may ultimately obtain from us, or the jurisdiction in which we are doing business with you. For example, if you are a California resident, you may have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act as described in our
CCPA disclosure
. You can access many of these policies using the links at the bottom of this page.
We work hard to protect your information.
We take our responsibility to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your information, including personal information, very seriously. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable legal standards to secure such information from unauthorized access and use, accidental or unlawful alteration and destruction, and other unlawful or unauthorized forms of Processing. We hold our employees accountable for complying with relevant policies, procedures, rules and regulations concerning the privacy and confidentiality of information.
We want you to understand the type of information we collect and how we use it.
The types of personal information we collect from you when you visit or use our online services include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number(s), account numbers, limited location information (for example, a zip code to help you find a J.P. Morgan office near you), user name and password. We may also collect payment card information, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers (or comparable), gender, race, nationality, and biometric identifiers when you provide it directly to us while using our online services and where we believe it is reasonably required for ordinary business purposes. In some instances, we create personal information about you, such as records of your interactions with us, and details of your accounts. We do not seek to collect or process sensitive personal information unless it is required or permitted by law; necessary for the detection or prevention of crime; necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal rights; or we have your prior explicit consent.
In addition to the personal information described above, we collect certain information about your use of our online services. For example, we capture the IP address of the device you use to connect to the online service, the type of operating system and browser you use, and information about the site you came from, the parts of our online service you access, and the site you visit next. As explained in more detail in our Cookies Policy, we and our third-party partners use cookies (as well as web beacons or other technologies) to collect and store this and other information about your visit to, or use of, our online services. We may later associate the usage and other information we collect online with personal information about you, as permitted or required by law.

Cookies policy
We sometimes collect information about you from additional online and offline sources including social media (to the extent you choose to make your personal information public) and commercially available third-party sources, such as credit reporting agencies. We may combine this information with the personal and other information we have collected about you under this Online Privacy Policy.
Where we are required to establish a legal basis to process your personal information as described in this Online Privacy Policy, we will do so on the basis that we have obtained your prior express consent to the processing; we have a legitimate business interest in the processing that is not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights, or freedoms; or the processing is needed to comply with applicable law, to perform under your contract(s) with us, or to protect the vital interests of any individual.
We use and otherwise process the information we collect from you to help us deliver our online services; to administer, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services, improving existing products and services, performing data analytics and other research tasks, communicating with you via any means, and performing accounting, auditing and other internal functions); manage our risks; to market our services and products; and to comply with and enforce applicable laws and regulations, relevant industry standards, contractual obligations and our policies. We also use data that we collect on an aggregate or anonymous basis (such that it does not identify any individuals or clients) for various business purposes, where permissible under applicable laws and regulations.
We aim to collect only what we need, keep it up-to-date and remove it when we no longer need it.
We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is limited to what we require in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy; it is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; and it is erased or rectified without delay if it is inaccurate. From time to time we may ask you to confirm the accuracy of your personal information.
For some of our online services, you can review or update certain account information by logging in and accessing the “Client Center” or a similar user profile section. If you cannot change the incorrect information online, or you prefer to request changes offline, please contact your J.P. Morgan representative using the contact information listed on your account statements, records, or other account materials.
We will retain copies in a form that permits identification for as long as we deem necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy, unless applicable law requires a longer retention period. In particular, we will retain personal information for as long as it is needed to establish, exercise or defend any legal rights.
We respect and protect your privacy even when you’re on the go.
For your convenience, J.P. Morgan offers you the ability to access some of our products and services through mobile applications and mobile-optimized websites. When you interact with us through your mobile device, we collect information such as unique device identifiers, your screen resolution and other device settings, information about your location, and analytical information about how you use your mobile device. We typically ask your permission before collecting certain information such as precise geolocation information.
We share personal information with affiliates and with others when we believe it will enhance the services and products we can provide to you or for legal and routine business reasons.
We share personal information among our affiliates and business units when we believe it will enhance the services we can provide, but only in circumstances where such sharing conforms to law, any applicable confidentiality agreements, and our policies and practices. Additionally, we reserve the right to share your personal information in connection with a corporate change including a merger, acquisition or sale of all or any relevant portion of our business or assets.
We disclose information we have about you as required or permitted by law. For example, we share information with regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal requirements.
We share information with third parties where appropriate to protect against fraud or verify or enforce our terms of use, our other rights, or other applicable policies.
From time to time, we enter into agreements with other companies to provide services to us, or to make services and products available to you. If these companies receive your personal information, they are required to safeguard it and only use it for those purposes we specify.
J.P. Morgan believes that keeping your information secure and private is important, particularly when using third-party websites and applications that can help you invest or manage your finances. In partnering with Intuit, which provides the aggregation service Mint, J.P. Morgan has taken measures to keep your logon information secure and private. When you are prompted to provide your J.P. Morgan user ID and password to Mint, you will be entering your information directly into a J.P. Morgan protected site. Mint will not see or be able to store your user ID and password, and will only require a single logon for all of your devices and browsers to work.
We can share your personal information with any person or entity if we have your consent to do so.
We transmit, transfer or process information to, or through, other countries in the world, as we deem necessary, appropriate or consistent with legal or regulatory obligations.
As a global company, we strive to provide you with access to the highest quality financial products and services wherever you are. To do this, we sometimes share your personal information among members of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. family of companies or service providers and other third parties that are located outside your home country. These countries may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements, with some providing more protection than others. J.P. Morgan will take appropriate steps to ensure your personal information is handled as described in this Online Privacy Policy.
Where required, we comply with applicable legal frameworks relating to the transfer of personal information. For example, under the European rules designed to adequately protect personal information transferred outside the European Economic Area we transfer personal information on the basis of determinations by the European Commission that certain countries adequately protect personal information, our Binding Corporate Rules, approved Model Contractual Clauses, and other valid transfer mechanisms.
We respect your rights concerning the processing of personal information and provide you with relevant and appropriate choices.
Depending on how and where you interact with us, you may have a right to one or more of the following with respect to your personal information we process or control:
request access to, or copies of, your personal information, together with details about how we process it;
request rectification of any inaccuracies;
request erasure or restriction of Processing;
object to processing by us or on our behalf;
have personal information transferred to another party;
withdraw consent to processing; and
lodge complaints with a data protection authority regarding any processing by us or on our behalf.
To exercise one or more of these rights or to ask a question about them, please use the contact details provided below.
In addition to the rights you have under applicable data protection laws, we may give you choices regarding the sharing of personal information with affiliates and third parties based on your relationship(s) with us as a financial institution. Choices you have about the sharing of your personal information will be described in the privacy policies or notices you receive from us, such as those provided in connection with particular financial products or services you obtain from us.
We respect your decisions about the collection of personal information related to your online activities over time and across different websites for advertising purposes.
J.P. Morgan does not allow unaffiliated third parties to collect personal information about your online activities when you visit our online services. Nor do we use personal information collected across non-affiliated websites for the purpose of serving you advertising related to your browsing behavior. If we engage in this practice in the future, we will provide appropriate notice and choice so that you can opt-out of the practice.
We tell you when our privacy policies and practices change.
We want to hear from you if you have questions.
If
you have any comments, questions or concerns about any of the information in this Online Privacy Policy, or any other issues relating to the processing of your personal information by J.P. Morgan under this Policy, please contact your regular J.P. Morgan client service contact, or:

the right to opt out of our sharing your personal information for the purpose of cross contextual behavioral advertising
the right, in certain circumstances, to correct inaccurate personal information we collected about you; and
the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.

Sharing Personal Information
We may sometimes share personal information (specifically, personal identifiers and internet or other electronic network activity information) with our marketing partners for cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes. California residents may have a right to opt out of this sharing. To facilitate this right, we recognize Global Privacy Control (GPC) opt-out preference signals. GPC is a setting available in some browsers that notifies our websites of a California resident’s decision to opt out of the sharing of their personal information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes. You can learn how to enable GPC on your browser
here.
Other means of communicating your behavioral advertising preferences include opting out through the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). Please click
here
and follow the instructions. You can also click on the Advertising Options Icon featured on certain JPMorgan Chase ads on third-party websites. Finally, you may be able to opt out using the privacy settings available through your device operating system (e.g., turning on "Opt out of Ads Personalization" in Android, or switching off “Allow Apps to Request to Track" in iOS).
Please bear in mind that opt outs may be specific to a browser or device. Therefore, you may need to opt out from each browser on each of the devices that you use. Note that even if you opt out, you may still receive advertisements from us, they just won’t be customized relying on the personal information you have opted out of being shared.
Sale of Personal Information
We do not offer an opt-out from the sale of personal information because we do not sell personal information as defined by the CCPA (and have not done so in the last 12 months).
Individuals Under 16 Years of Age
We do not knowingly collect or share personal information from children under 16 without parental consent.
Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
We do not offer a right to limit our use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information because we do not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information in such a manner as to require provision of the right (specifically, for purposes of inferring characteristics about an individual).

Merchant Services
J.P. Morgan
Privacy Statement
for Merchant Services
Commitment to
Privacy and Security
Merchant Services, through its operating entities Paymentech, LLC, WePay, Inc., Chase Paymentech Europe Limited, J.P. Morgan Wholesale Payments Europe Limited, WePay Payments Ltd., J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A. London Branch and Chase Paymentech Solutions Inc. (collectively, “Merchant Services”), is committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of the personal information it collects. This Privacy Statement explains Merchant Services’ policies and practices with respect to the handling of personal information. This Privacy Statement shall be read and is provided in addition to other privacy policies or statements you receive or encounter from the JPMorgan Chase & Co. family of companies; please know that this policy controls for purposes of your accounts or relationships with Merchant Services.
Circumstances Where We
Collect Information
Merchant Services’ customers are businesses and other legal entities desiring to accept credit or debit cards or other payment methods, as payment for goods or services or as donations (“Merchants”). Merchant Services does not provide services for consumer, personal, family or household purposes and generally does not have direct relationships with, or collect information directly from, individual consumers. The personal information we receive and collect, as described below, relates to our Merchants (and their owners and operators), the payment transactions we help Merchants execute, and representatives of prospective or potential business customers interested in learning more about our services.
Circumstances where Merchant Services collects information, including personal information, include the following:
Browsing our Websites.
When you browse our websites, we collect information as described in the online privacy policy or statement applicable to that website.
Your Inquiries.
When you complete and submit a form or otherwise provide us with personal information about you on our websites, or contact us by e-mail, fax, or telephone, Merchant Services stores the inquiries and their contents. Merchant Services, pursuant to applicable law, may record or monitor telephone calls for business purposes, including quality assurance, training, and record keeping.
Opening an Account or Using Our Services.
When you submit an application to become a Merchant, you will be required to provide us with certain information about your business, and its owners and officers, which also act as guarantors of the Merchant’s obligations. Personal information we collect about owners, officers and guarantors includes name and personal contact information, date of birth, tax identification number and ownership information. When you open an account or submit an application, Merchant Services also obtains and stores credit, financial and other personal information about your business, and its officers, owners and guarantors from consumer reporting agencies, credit bureaus, relevant financial institutions, and other entities.
From Customers of Our Merchants.
If a consumer purchases a product or service from a Merchant using a credit or debit card, or any other method of payment for which we provide the Merchant with transaction processing services, the consumer will likely provide that Merchant with certain personal information including, for example, the consumer’s name, credit card number and transaction information. Our Merchants transmit some of this information (“Order Information”) to us in connection with processing the transaction.
From Our Partners
. If an online platform provides Merchant Services integrated with the platform’s own services, the platform provides us with information about our shared users, such as length of the relationship and purpose of the payments.
Merchant Services is a global business and therefore we transmit, transfer, store or process personal information to, or through, other countries in the world, as we deem necessary, appropriate, and in accordance with applicable legal, contractual or regulatory obligations. When we do, we take appropriate steps to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our employees, affiliates and third parties we engage to provide services on our behalf are responsible for complying with the data protection requirements set forth in this Privacy Statement.
Use and Disclosure of
Information
Merchant Services uses, retains and discloses personal information to (i) comply with any applicable legislation requiring Merchant Services to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each entity with which it establishes a Merchant relationship; (ii) evaluate your eligibility for a Merchant account, which involves disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, commercial credit bureaus, and relevant financial institutions; and (iii) as required or permitted by law. Merchant Services also uses your information to contact you about other Merchant Services offerings and services, as well as offerings and services of our affiliates. If you are, or become a Merchant, Merchant Services discloses your information, and information about your officers, directors and guarantors during the course of providing such services to card associations, banks and other financial institutions involved in the course of processing or screening the transaction, and to third parties that have contracted with Merchant Services to perform certain functions of our services on our behalf. Merchant Services uses or discloses your personal information for the additional purposes of facilitating and completing merchant-initiated or authorized transactions; complying with local laws, including credit reporting laws and card association rules; assisting in preventing fraud; informing you about general company news, product updates and developments, card association rules, and industry trends; offering you products and services of interest to you; or as otherwise permitted by your agreements with us, your consent, or as required by applicable law.
Examples where we use and disclose information include:
Service Providers.
Merchant Services provides personal information to outside organizations as necessary to provide requested services. Our contracts with such third parties require that any information that we provide to them is kept confidential and used solely for the purposes of providing the services that they have been contracted with to provide.
Government Inquiries.
We share information with regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials when we believe such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal requirements. We share information with third parties where appropriate to protect against fraud or verify or enforce our terms of use, our other rights, or other applicable policies.
Referral Programs.
Where a Merchant is referred to Merchant Services by a referral partner, Merchant Services shares Merchant information, including name, location, Merchant ID, transaction volume, card summary and Merchant status, with the referral partner as necessary to administer the referral arrangement, including to calculate fees, determine Merchant’s continued eligibility for the referral program and any preferred pricing, and servicing and managing the Merchant’s account.
Integrated Payments
. Where an online platform provides Merchant Services integrated with the platform’s own services, Merchant Services shares with the platform information about our shared users, including their personal information. The online platform can use and disclose the information in accordance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and the online platform’s own privacy policy.
Order Information.
When we provide processing services to our Merchants, we disclose Order Information to banks, other processors, credit and debit card organizations and associations, and other financial institutions involved in effecting the transaction represented by the Order Information. In addition, we disclose some or all of the information we collect to our affiliated companies or to non-affiliated third parties where necessary or appropriate to comply with local laws or the rules and regulations of the respective card organizations or other payment entities.
De-identified information.
We also use and disclose data we collect or generate on an aggregate or de-identified basis (such that it does not identify any individual Merchant or card holder) for business purposes, where permissible under applicable laws and regulations.
Protection of Cardholder and
Merchant Data
Merchant Services has implemented various measures, in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”), to help ensure the security and confidentiality of cardholder and Merchant data. These measures include appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and against unauthorized access to or use of such information.
Retention of
Information
Merchant Services retains the personal information it collects as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it was collected, subject to reasonable legal limitation periods, statutory or regulatory retention requirements and legitimate business requirements.
Merchant Services will use reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information which is no longer required will be disposed of or destroyed in a secure manner.
Personal
Information
For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, “personal information” means information that identifies, is identifiable to, or can be used to identify an individual alone or in combination with other information, as more particularly defined in applicable privacy legislation. Personal information does not include aggregate information that cannot be associated with a specific individual, and in certain jurisdictions, it also excludes business contact information.
Modifications to
Privacy Statement
We continue to review our policies and procedures to assure they are effective in meeting our commitments to our Merchants. Accordingly, we may change this Privacy Statement from time to time. When we do, we will let you know by appropriate means such as by posting the revised statement on this page with a new “Last Modified” date. All changes will become effective when posted unless indicated otherwise.

Introduction
The Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) is a global tax transparency and reporting regime designed for the automatic exchange of information (“AEI”) between tax authorities, developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) to combat tax evasion.
It requires reporting financial institutions that are located in a participating jurisdiction (i.e. a jurisdiction that has implemented CRS) to comply with certain identification and reporting requirements.
CRS came into effect in certain jurisdictions from 1 January 2016 (so called “first adopter jurisdictions”) with the first reporting made during the year 2017. Other jurisdictions decided to implement CRS one year after (so called “late adopter jurisdictions”), with the first reporting to be made during the year 2018.
Implications for Clients
Financial Institutions located in CRS participating jurisdictions are required to determine whether clients/account holders (including controlling persons of certain types of entity account holders) are reportable either by collecting information through a self-certification document or, in the case of accounts opened before the implementation of the CRS, by reviewing the information previously collected.
Further to the due diligence process described above, where the client/account holder is tax resident in a reportable jurisdiction the financial institution will report its personal and financial information to the Tax Authorities of the jurisdiction where the financial institution is located. The Tax Authorities will then exchange the information received from the financial institution with the Tax Authorities of the jurisdiction of tax residence of the client/account holder.
The list of reportable jurisdictions is determined by the jurisdiction in which the financial institution is located.
CRS implementation in Switzerland
Switzerland adopted the CRS by enacting the Federal Act on the International Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (or “AEI Act”) on 18 December 2015 with an implementation date of 1 January 2017. That means the first period in which financial accounts are reportable in Switzerland is 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 with the first reporting to be made by 30 June 2018.
The list of Reportable Jurisdictions, i.e. of Jurisdictions with which Switzerland will exchange information can be found at the following address, which is kept up to date by the Swiss Tax Authorities:
https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/multilateral/steuer_informationsaust/automatischer-informationsaustausch/automatischer-informationsaustausch1.html
Please note that the exchange of information under CRS will be performed annually.
For more detailed information about CRS and the account information that will be exchanged, please contact your J.P. Morgan representative.

In accordance with the requirements of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2014/65/EU) and associated regulatory technical standards, J.P. Morgan SE
(JPMSE)
is required to meet certain obligations in relation to what is called Best Execution. Best Execution relates to the way in which we execute, place or transmit orders on our clients' behalf.
A description of the approach taken by J.P. Morgan to achieve Best Execution when executing or transmitting client orders is available here.

The new Payment Services Directive (PSD2) which came into effect on 13 January 2018, is a European legislation which aims to improve and encourage safer and innovative payment services across the European Union (EU).
What you need to know
The original PSD legislation of 2007 established a single market for payments in the EU, and encouraged the ease and efficiency of cross-border payments. Since 2007, changes and modernisation in the payments sector has heralded an update to the original scope of PSD.
The new directive represents a step further towards complete harmonisation of the EU payments market. For further information on the new legislation and its enhanced features, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions on the
European Commission
website.

Introduction
This policy sets out how we integrate shareholder engagement into our investment strategy when managing client portfolios under a discretionary investment mandate. In accordance with such mandates we, J.P. Morgan S.E. (“JPMSE” and including our branches, “J.P. Morgan Private Bank”) may invest directly in shares issued by companies with their registered office in an EU member state and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within an EU member state.
J.P. Morgan Private Bank typically invests in shares indirectly via third party managed portfolios (i.e.
mutual funds and exchange traded funds) and also invests in shares directly via separately managed accounts in relation to which a third party investment advisor is appointed (together “Third Party Portfolios”).
J.P. Morgan Private Bank has also delegated the investment management of certain discretionary portfolios in shares to J.P. Morgan Asset Management (UK) Limited (“JPMAM”) or third party Asset Managers. This engagement policy only applies to engagement activities directly carried out by J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
For information on JPMAM’s approach to engagement please see the JPMAM website:
https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/per/about-us/investment-stewardship/
How we monitor the companies that we invest in
J.P. Morgan Private Bank does not directly undertake monitoring of investee companies. However, J.P. Morgan Private Bank undertakes monitoring of Third Party Portfolios, including the approach of Third Party Portfolio advisors or managers (“Third Party Portfolio Managers”) to monitoring investee companies.
Prior to on-boarding a Third Party Portfolio, J.P. Morgan Private Bank undertakes a detailed due diligence exercise of qualitative and quantitative assessments that reviews, amongst other issues, the investment merits, Environmental Social and Governance (“ESG”) eligibility and principal adverse impact (“PAI”) considerations and priorities of the Third Party Portfolio. Information is collected and analyzed by due diligence teams until such time as the due diligence and portfolio management teams are satisfied that sufficient information has been received to meet J.P. Morgan Private Bank’s on-boarding criteria. Information is then presented to the Investment Review Committee, which decides whether to approve the relevant Third Party Portfolio.
Approved Third Party Portfolios are monitored periodically. The due diligence and portfolio management teams maintain a dialogue with Third Party Portfolio Managers, including a series of questions designed to assess and review the information previously provided. The due diligence and portfolio management teams regularly review collated information received about Third Party Portfolios and conduct interim assessments.
These assessments include, but are not limited to, the Third Party Portfolio Manager’s implementation of the stated strategy, ESG eligibility (including review of information on ESG/PAIs), financial and non-financial performance and risk, capital structure and corporate governance, as well as the Third Party Portfolio Manager’s assessment of investee companies. From these reviews, a recommendation for watch, probation, termination or retention of approved status is made to the J.P. Morgan Private Bank Investment Performance Governance Committee. This Committee may challenge, and then either approve or reject, the recommendation.
How we engage with the companies that we invest in
J.P. Morgan Private Bank does not directly undertake shareholder engagement activities with investee companies (because of the nature of its private wealth business and client base). However, J.P. Morgan Private Bank engages with Third Party Portfolio Managers both before and during the period of investment as part of the selection and ongoing monitoring processes described above, including requesting information about Third Party Portfolio Managers’ approaches to engagement with investee companies.
Due diligence teams collect information on Third Party Portfolios via requests for information and questionnaires. These questionnaires may include requests for information on ESG integration and on engagement/stewardship, as well as other ad hoc or thematic questionnaires.
Voting rights and use of proxy voting advisors
At present, J.P. Morgan Private Bank does not exercise voting rights on behalf of clients and is not currently engaged with any proxy voting advisors. However, clients of JPMSE may exercise their votes, on the shares they hold in their account(s), via J.P. Morgan Online International (“JPOI”) at no cost.”
Actual or potential conflicts of interest
J.P. Morgan Private Bank has policies and procedures in place to address material conflicts of interest. These policies and procedures apply to all of its engagement activities.
J.P. Morgan Private Bank Code statement
J.P. Morgan Bank SE and its branches ("J.P. Morgan Private Bank") is a member of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. group of companies ("JPMC Group"), an international, multi-service banking group. J.P. Morgan Private Bank provides a range of private banking services to its clients, including discretionary investment management.
Application of the Code
While the majority of J.P. Morgan Private Bank's clients are categorised as retail clients, or are natural persons, discretionary investment management is also carried out for some professional clients that are legal persons. This activity is therefore in scope of the UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code"). This statement sets out J.P. Morgan Private Bank's policy in relation to the Code [and is publicly available on its website].
Nature of commitment to the Code
J.P. Morgan Private Bank does not commit to the Code, although it does broadly support the Code&rsquo;s aims of promoting the long-term success of companies in such a way that the providers of capital also prosper. With respect to discretionary investment management for professional clients in scope of the Code, J.P. Morgan Private Bank will generally not exercise voting rights. However, J.P. Morgan Private Bank may from time to time choose to exercise its discretion to vote in circumstances where it believes this to be in its clients' best interests. Any voting activity that J.P. Morgan Private Bank undertakes is treated as a strictly confidential matter between itself and its clients, and, accordingly, such activity will not be publicly disclosed.
J.P. Morgan Private Bank&rsquo;s investment strategy
J.P. Morgan Private Bank's overall objective for its discretionary investment management service is to deliver risk-adjusted returns that are appropriate and commensurate with the financial goals and risk tolerances of its clients over time. J.P. Morgan Private Bank implements a holistic investment approach for its clients, and considers a range of assets when undertaking portfolio construction. Where the portfolio construction process determines that exposure to equities is required, this exposure will typically be through vehicles that are managed by JPMC Group or third-party investment managers, such as mutual funds or hedge funds. Each vehicle will be subject to due diligence by full-time specialist due diligence teams before it can be invested in by J.P. Morgan Private Bank portfolio managers, in a process that measures each vehicle against a broad range of attributes. This process has been designed to help deliver sustainable, risk-adjusted returns for J.P. Morgan Private Bank&rsquo;s clients when investing in equities on a discretionary basis.

QUESTIONS
If you have any question or query in relation to our complaint handling procedure, please contact the IPB Client Experience Team.
J.P. Morgan SE is a participant in the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). The FSCS can pay compensation to claimants if an institution is unable to meet its financial obligations. The FSCS is only available to certain types of claimants and claims. Payments to eligible claimants under the FSCS will vary depending on the type of protected claim the claimants hold with respect to the relevant institution. Payments under the FSCS in respect of protected deposits are subject to a limit on the maximum compensation that any eligible depositor is entitled to claim. Payments under the FSCS in respect of Designated Investment Business (as defined under the FSCS) are subject to a maximum payment per eligible investor. Details of these deposit and investment limits can be found at https://www.fscs.org.uk./what-we-cover/investments/. The compensation limits relate to the combined amount in all the eligible claimant’s accounts with the relevant J.P. Morgan firm.
Please note that financial instruments and other Investments which are not deposits for UK regulatory purposes are not protected in the same manner as deposits. This means that should the issuer or product provider of such a financial instrument or other Investments fail to pay under the instrument or should the instrument fall in value, you would not be entitled to any protection under the FSCS solely on the basis of such a failure or such fall in value. FSCS cover may be available for claims against a party who provides investment business to you where the claim is directly related to the provision of that investment business, for example, if you have a claim against J.P. Morgan SE in relation to such investment business and we are unable to meet our obligations under that claim.
A detailed description of the FSCS (including information on how to make a claim, eligibility criteria and the procedures involved) is available from the FSCS, who can be contacted at 10th Floor, Beaufort House, 15 St Botolph Street, London EC3A 7QU or accessed online at
www.fscs.org.uk
.
In addition, deposits with J.P. Morgan SE are covered by the German private banks’ statutory compensation scheme for depositors and investors (Entschädigungseinrichtung deutscher banken, EdB).
The EdB (Burgstraße 28, 10178 Berlin, Germany, http://www.edb-banken.de) protects deposits and certain liabilities arising from securities transactions at certain credit institutions to the extent provided for under the German Deposit Guarantee Act, and if applicable, in connection with the German Investor Compensation Act. Private individuals as well as partnerships and corporations are entitled to compensation. Deposits of banks and institutional investors, such as financial institutions and investment firms, undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities, insurance undertakings and deposits of public authorities are not covered. The EdB protects deposits up to a limit of EUR 100,000 per depositor and 90% of liabilities arising from investment business, limited to the equivalent of EUR 20,000. Liabilities in respect of which a bank has issued bearer instruments such as bearer bonds and bearer deposit certificates are not protected. Compensation is provided in connection with investment business particularly if, contrary to its duties, a bank is unable to return monies owed to a customer in connection with securities transactions and/or financial instruments owned by the customer and held in custody on its behalf.
We have become aware of certain scams and attempted fraud relating to the offer of bogus investment opportunities with J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Potential investors may be contacted by people claiming to be from J.P. Morgan Private Bank who try to persuade them to invest with them. They may contact you through various channels such as email, phone calls, texts, WhatsApp and others to offer you advice, request payment from you, or they may provide links to websites or marketing material relating to bogus investment products.
The products they may try to sell you may bear the official J.P. Morgan Private Bank branding or logos to appear legitimate. When potential investors are contacted and pressured to buy a product or invest their money, this is often known as a
boiler room scam
. The approach may be gentle with the individual being very friendly and reassuring, or they may take a more urgent tone, encouraging you to buy in quickly or risk losing money. These scams happen from time to time so it is best to be vigilant. For more details on these scams, please see the Action Fraud
website

If you receive a call from an individual representing J.P. Morgan and you have concerns about their identity, then please end the call. If you are a client of J.P. Morgan Private Bank please contact your designated J.P. Morgan Private Bank representative. If you are not a client of J.P. Morgan, please be aware that J.P. Morgan does not carry out cold calling activity.
Details on how to contact the Financial Conduct Authority can be found

What you can do to protect yourself:
Research the company, investment and salesperson
to ensure they are legitimate. Don’t be pressured or rushed into buying an investment before investigating the “opportunity”
Be wary of investments that promise spectacular profits or “guaranteed” returns.
If an investment seems too good to be true, then it probably is
Be cautious when responding to special investment offers,
especially through unsolicited communications, as fraudsters are increasingly targeting investors online. Protect yourselves by limiting the information you share
Be wary of emails that contain
urgency, misspelling and grammatical errors
Be wary of sharing personal details
such as PINs, passwords or answers to your security questions, even during the course of business. You should not assume a request or provided information is genuine. J.P. Morgan will never ask you for this type of information via email.

SFDR Article 5 Remuneration Disclosure
Date of Publication
:
30 April 2024 (updated from prior version of 10 March 2021)
Summary of changes from prior year:
Disclosure language updated to provide additional detail on the Firm’s pay-for-performance framework, including the performance assessment of its Portfolio Managers.
The Firm’s pay-for-performance framework focuses on Total Compensation – base salary and incentive pay – based on the performance of the Firm, the LOB or function and the individual. This includes a balanced and holistic evaluation of an employee’s performance across four broad Performance Dimensions, business results, client/customer/stakeholder, teamwork and leadership, and risk, controls and conduct. These performance dimensions appropriately consider short, medium and long-term priorities that drive sustained shareholder value, while accounting for risk, controls, and conduct objectives. To promote a proper pay-for-performance alignment, the Firm also considers other relevant factors, including market practices. No single performance dimension in isolation determines total compensation; however, it is possible for a single significant shortcoming in any performance dimension to have a downward impact on variable compensation without limitation.
When conducting this balanced assessment of performance, for select employees in the Portfolio Management population regard is given, but is not limited to:
investment performance, generally weighted to the long term, with specific consideration for portfolio managers of investment performance relative to competitive indices or peers over one-, three-, five- and ten-year periods;
the scale and complexity of their investment responsibilities
individual contribution relative to the client’s risk and return objectives
adherence with the Firm’s compliance, risk, regulatory and client fiduciary responsibilities, including adherence to the sustainability risk policies
In addition to the above factors for assessing the performance of investment professionals, the firm-wide pay-for-performance framework, together with the overall performance of the relevant business unit and investment team, is integrated into the final assessment of Incentive Compensation for an individual investment professional. Feedback from JPMorgan’s risk and control professionals is considered in assessing performance and compensation.

Sustainability Risk Disclosure
SFDR Article 3 Disclosure
Date of publication: 03 October, 2023 (change description amended 12 July, 2024)
This disclosure required under Article 3 of the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (“SFDR”), has been updated as follows:
Clarifications were made to how we describe our processes regarding the consideration of sustainability risks in discretionary investment management strategies and investment advice provided in relation to funds, specifying that we consider sustainability risks as part of the qualitative due diligence process for funds held in our discretionary strategies and sub-advisors of our discretionary strategies, and that the same process has been applied for certain Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“
UCITS
”) funds and certain Alternative investment funds (“
AIFs
”) over which investment advice is provided.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
As part of the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (2019/2088) (SFDR), we are required to provide information about our policies on the integration of sustainability risk into our investment decision-making and investment advice.
“
Sustainability risk
” is defined in SFDR as an environmental, social or governance event or condition which, if it occurs, could cause an actual or potential material negative impact on the value of an investment.
J.P. Morgan SE (“
JPMSE
”) considers sustainability risks as part of its qualitative due diligence processes for:
Funds held in its discretionary investment management strategies
For the selection of third party providers of investment advice or discretionary investment management services in relation to such strategies
Certain Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“
UCITS
”) funds over which investment advice is provided
Certain Alternative investment funds (“
AIFs
”) over which investment advice is provided
JPMSE’s policies on the consideration of sustainability risk have been incorporated into handbooks and procedures across its business. As part of these procedures, JPMSE’s portfolio managers are provided with information on sustainability risk and are encouraged to take it into account when making investment decisions.
Sustainability risk would not in itself prevent JPMSE from making or recommending an investment. Instead, sustainability risk forms part of JPMSE’s overall risk management processes, and is one of many risks which may, depending on the specific investment opportunity, be relevant to JPMSE’s determination of risk.

The
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Clients
govern the business relationship between you and J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA.
Effective 22 January 2025
This Booklet
illustrates the scenarios under which J.P Morgan (Suisse) SA may be required to or allowed to share certain information to third parties or affiliates.
The Booklet may be amended or updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices with respect to the disclosure of client data in Switzerland or abroad, or changes in applicable law. We encourage you to read this Booklet carefully, and to regularly check this page to review any changes we might make.
The financial markets present many different risks of which investors should be aware prior to investing. It is the policy of J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA (the “Bank” or “J.P. Morgan” or “we”) to draw the attention of its client(s) (the “Client” or “Investor” or “you”) to the risk factors which may make certain investments more risky and/or more complex than standard investments. This Risk Disclosure Booklet forms part of the J.P. Morgan Terms and Conditions Applicable to Clients (the “Private Client Terms”).

What is it?
The Swiss Financial Services Act (FinSA), which came into effect on 1 January 2020, specifies the rules of conduct that financial service providers must adhere to in order to strengthen investor protection and increase market transparency.
FinSA applies both to financial services provided to clients domiciled in Switzerland as well as to financial services provided in Switzerland.
What does it mean for me?
Client Classification
One of the requirements under FinSA is for financial service providers to classify their clients as
retail, professional or institutional
. Retail clients are all clients that are not classified as professional clients. Institutional clients are a subcategory of professional clients. Depending on your knowledge, experience and financial expertise, you will fall within either one of these three categories.
Investor Protection
These three classifications have various
effects
on your protection and your investments with us. Retail clients benefit from the highest level of investor protection under FinSA with very stringent
information, reporting and documentation
duties but have a limited access to our products.
You may request to change categories at any time over the course of your relationship with us depending on whether you wish to access our full product range or whether you wish to benefit from a higher level of investor protection. Please note however that any request is subject to conditions.
If you would like to request a change in your classification or if you have any questions, please contact your J.P. Morgan Representative.
Complaints
If you are unhappy with any aspect of the provision of our products or services, please contact your J.P. Morgan Representative in the first instance whether in person, by telephone, email or in writing at:

Swiss Banking Ombudsman
If no mutually agreeable solution can be found to a dispute with the Bank, you can apply to the
Swiss Banking Ombudsman
, a free and impartial information and mediation service.
Generally, the Ombudsman only gets involved after the client has made a complaint in writing to the bank and the bank has had the opportunity to respond.
