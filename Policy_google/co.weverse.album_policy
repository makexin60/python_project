                property or safety of Google, its users or the
                public; or (iii) provides Customer Data in certain
                limited circumstances to third parties to carry out
                tasks on Google's behalf (e.g., billing or data

                data from being used or shared except as directed
                by Google. When this is done, it is subject to
                agreements that oblige those parties to process

                Google will post notice of modifications to these
                terms at
https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/
,
                the Google Analytics Policies at
www.google.com/analytics/policies/
, or
                other policies referenced in these terms at the
                applicable URL for such policies. Changes will not
                apply retroactively and will become effective no
                sooner than 14 days after they are posted. If You
                do not agree to the modified terms for the Service,

                Google, (ii) You accept updated terms online, or
                (iii) You continue to use the Service after Google
                has posted updates to the Agreement or to any
                policy governing the Service.
16. Miscellaneous, Applicable Law and Venue.
(a) Google will be excused from performance in this
                Agreement to the extent that performance is
                prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond
                its reasonable control. (b) This Agreement
                (including any amendment agreed upon by the parties
                in writing) represents the complete agreement
                between You and Google concerning its subject
                matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and
                representations between the parties. (c) If any
                provision of this Agreement is held to be
                unenforceable for any reason, such provision will
                be reformed to the extent necessary to make it
                enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as
                to effect the intent of the parties, and the
                remainder of this Agreement will continue in full
                force and effect. (d) This Agreement will be
                governed by and construed under the laws of the
                state of California without reference to its
                conflict of law principles. In the event of any
                conflicts between foreign law, rules, and
                regulations, and California law, rules, and
                regulations, California law, rules and regulations
                will prevail and govern. Each party agrees to
                submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction
                of the courts located in Santa Clara County,
                California. The United Nations Convention on
                Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and
                the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act
                do not apply to this Agreement. You will comply
                with all applicable export control and sanctions
                laws and regulations, including (i) the Export
                Administration Regulations ("EAR") maintained by
                the U.S. Department of Commerce, (ii) trade and
                economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Treasury
                Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and
                (iii) the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
                ("ITAR") maintained by the U.S. Department of
                State. (f) Any notices to Google must be sent to:
                Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
                View, CA 94043, USA, with a copy to Legal
                Department, via first class or air mail or
                overnight courier, and are deemed given upon
                receipt. (g) A waiver of any default is not a
                waiver of any subsequent default. (h) You may not
                assign or otherwise transfer any of Your rights in
                this Agreement without Google's prior written
                consent, and any such attempt is void. (i) The
                relationship between Google and You is not one of a
                legal partnership relationship, but is one of
                independent contractors. (j) This Agreement will be
                binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
                respective successors and assigns of the parties
                hereto. (k) The following sections of this
                Agreement will survive any termination thereof: 1,
                4, 5, 6 (except the last two sentences), 7, 8, 9,
                10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 17.
17. Google Analytics and Firebase.
If You link a GA Property to Firebase
                (“
Firebase Linkage
”) as part of
                using the Service, the following terms, in addition
                to Sections 1-16 above, will also apply to You, and
                will also govern Your use of the Service, including
                with respect to Your use of Firebase Linkage. Other
                than as modified below, all other terms will stay
                the same and continue to apply. In the event of a
                conflict between this Section 17 and Sections 1-16
                above, the terms in Section 17 will govern and
                control solely with respect to Your use of the
                Firebase Linkage.
The following sentence is added to the end of
                Section 7 as follows:
If You link a GA Property to a Firebase project
                (“
Firebase Linkage
”) (i) certain
                data from Your GA Property, including Customer
                Data, may be made accessible within or to any other
                entity or personnel specified in the applicable
                Firebase settings and (ii) that GA Property may
                have certain Service settings modified by
                authorized personnel specified in the applicable
                Firebase settings (notwithstanding the settings You
                may have designated for that GA Property within the
                Service).
