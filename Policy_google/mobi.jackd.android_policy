the right of individuals to access their personal data and the choices and means we offer individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal data.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed.

Certain personal data, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, is considered sensitive personal data. We will not use sensitive personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual unless we have received your affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in).
When we receive personal data and then transfer it to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf, we remain liable under the applicable DPF Principles if the agent processes the personal data in a manner inconsistent with the applicable DPF Principles, unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). The FTC has jurisdiction over our compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. We may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
