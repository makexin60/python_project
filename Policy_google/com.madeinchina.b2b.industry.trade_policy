                        you personally. The above partners may combine the above information with other data they have
                        legally obtained to provide the advertising services or implement our decision-making.
2) Suppliers, service providers and other partners
We will send information to suppliers, service providers and other partners
                        who provide us with business support, including providing technical infrastructure services,
                        hardware and software product services or system product services, analyzing how our services
                        are used, evaluating the effectiveness of our advertising and services, providing customer
                        services or payment facilities, conducting academic research and surveys, and providing

                        authorized software or MachTop.
In the process of dealing with sensitive PI, we will take technical measures
                        to process the PI, and disconnect your association with specific information such as your
                        identity so as not to identify a specific individual.
If you refuse to provide PI that
                            is necessary for our partners to provide services, you might not be able to use the services
                            provided by the partners through MachTop.
3) If you participate in a lucky draw or similar advertising promotion, your
                        information (name, phone number (including mobile phone number), and address) will be provided
                        to courier service providers, such as SF Express, YTO Express and DHL (as indicated on the
                        website), or the relevant suppliers to the extent necessary for MachTop or prizes and goods
                        suppliers to deliver the relevant prizes and goods to you.

2.
When the transfer of PI is involved in a merger, acquisition, asset transfer,
                        bankruptcy liquidation, or similar situation, we will require the new company or organization to
                        which your PI is transferred to continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy; otherwise we will
                        require the new company or organization to seek your authorization or consent again.
(III) Public disclosure
Your PI is an important part of our services for you. We will abide by the legal
                    provisions to keep your PI confidential. We will only publicly disclose your PI under the following

3. Upon confirming your violation of laws or regulations or severe violation of
                            relevant agreements or rules of MachTop, or for the purpose of protecting the personal and

                        with other entities or be acquired or carry out other activities on the capital market
                        (including IPO and bond issuance), and when we need to accept due diligence conducted by other
                        subjects under other circumstances, we will provide your PI for the necessary subjects, provided
                        that we will sign a confidentiality agreement with such subjects, requiring them to take
                        reasonable confidentiality measures for your PI.

Some third-party SDKs or similar applications that we access may collect your PI. For example, when
                    you use services provided by third parties in our services, you agree that such third parties may
                    collect and process your PI. The situations where individual services are connected to third-party
                    SDKs may vary. For details of individual services' specific connection to third-party SDKs, please
                    consult the specific clauses and related pages for individual services at corresponding service
                    pages. You may also choose to contact us
through the contact information specified in this
                        Policy.
We will answer you within 7 working days.
The above third-party social media or other services are operated by the relevant
                    third parties. If you use such third-party social media services or other services (including
                    providing any information for such third parties), you shall be bound by the third parties' own
                    service terms and information protection statement (not this Policy), and you need to read them
                    carefully.
This Policy applies only to the PI we collect and does not apply to the services
                        provided by any third party or third-party information use rules. If you find any risk in such
                        third-party social media or other services, it is recommended that you terminate the relevant
                        operations to protect your legitimate rights and interests and contact us in a timely
                        manner.
IV. How We Protect Your PI
(I) In order to safeguard your information security, we will endeavor to protect your PI by using
                    physical, electronic, and managing security measures in line with industry standards to prevent
                    unauthorized access or damage to, or public disclosure, use, modification or loss of your PI. We
                    will take all reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that no PI irrelevant to the realization of
                    services and functions is collected.
(II) The PI and materials about you collected by MachTop may be stored and processed at the
                    location of our company and/or our affiliates, and may also be stored and processed at the
                    information subjects who we deem necessary to know such information. We will delete your PI after
                    you de-register your account.
We will only retain your PI for a period necessary for achieving the
                    purposes described in this Policy, and delete or anonymously dispose of your PI upon expiration of
                    the above period, unless otherwise required laws and regulations.
(III) Since the Internet is by no means an absolutely secure environment, we strongly
                    recommend that you assist us in ensuring your account security by safe means and using complicated
                    passwords.
When using MachTop's services, you will inevitably disclose your PI to the
                    potential counterparty. Please protect your PI properly and provide it for others only in the
                    necessary circumstances. If you find a leakage of your PI, especially your account name or password,
                    please contact our customer service immediately so that we can take appropriate measures.
Public information refers to any information that you voluntarily and
                    publicly share. Anyone can view or access such information during use and future use of MachTop.
                    It shall be noted that the PI you voluntarily share in using our services may involve PI or even
                    sensitive PI about you or others. Please consider more carefully whether you share or even make
                    public relevant PI when using our services.
The Internet environment is not 100% safe. We will do our best to guarantee the
                    safety of any PI you send to us. If your legitimate rights or interests are damaged due to any
                    unauthorized access to, or public disclosure, falsification or destruction of your PI as a result of
                    damage to our physical, technical, or managing or protective facilities, we will bear corresponding
                    legal liability.
(IV) If, unfortunately, any PI security incident occurs, we will, in accordance with the requirements
                    of laws and regulations, promptly notify you of: the basic information about and possible impact of
                    the incident, measures we have taken or are about to take, suggestions for you on how you should
                    prevent and reduce risks by yourself and remedies to be offered to you. We will promptly notify you
                    of relevant information about the incident by email, letter, telephone or push notification or, if
                    it is difficult to notify each PI subject, make a public announcement in a reasonable and effective
                    manner.
At the same time, we will also actively report how the PI security incidents are handled in
                    accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities.
V. How You Manage Your PI
We attach great importance to your attention to PI and make every effort to protect your right to
                inquiry, correct and delete your PI, de-register an account, and withdraw your consent, so that you have
                sufficient capabilities to guarantee your privacy and security.
You can access and manage your PI by:
(I) Inquiring, correcting and supplementing your PI
You have the right to inquiry, correct or supplement your PI. You can do so by yourself in the
                    following ways:
1. You may click the arrow pointing to the right of "Login Account" on the member information page of
                    MachTop. After log-in, click my account on MachTop>>click the portrait to view your PI.
2. You may view your PI on the account information page of MachTop, and click the arrow pointing to
                    the right of "Name" "Mailbox" "Address" "Phone Number" and "Company Information" to correct and
                    supplement your PI.
(II) Deleting your PI
You may delete some of your PI by the ways specified in "(I) Inquirying,
                    correcting and supplementing your PI."
You can submit a request to delete your PI to us under the following
                    circumstances:
1. If our processing of PI violates laws or regulations;
2. If we collected and used your PI without your consent;
3. If our processing of PI breaches our agreement with you;
4. If you no longer use our products or services or you have voluntarily
                        cancelled your account;
5. If we no longer provide you with products or services permanently.
When we decide to respond to your deletion request, we will also inform
                        entities obtaining your PI from us and ask them to delete the same without delay, unless
                        otherwise provided for by laws and regulations, or such entities have obtained your independent
                        authorization.
After relevant information has been deleted by you, with or
                        without our help, we may not be able to delete the corresponding information from the backup
                        system immediately due to the restriction of applicable laws or security technologies. We will
                        retain your PI in a safe manner and further isolate it from other information till the backup
                        can be deleted or anonymized.
(III) Changing the scope of your authorization or consent
Each business function needs some basic PI to be completed (see Part I of this
                    Privacy Policy). In addition, you can check the activation status of the above authority on a
                    case-by-case basis in my account module (usually the push authorization is "Settings -
                    Noticification") of MachTop, and decide to activate or close such authority at any time (we will
                    instruct you to complete the settings in your device system). You can also withdraw all the
                    authorizations for us to continue to collect your PI by de-registering the account.
Please note that you are deemed to have authorized us to collect and use
                    such PI to realize the above functions by activitating such authority, or have cancelled such
                    authorizations by closing such autority, in which case we will no longer collect and use your PI or
                    provide you with the functions corresponding to such authorizations. Your decision to close the
                    authority will not affect the previous processing of PI based on your authorizations.
(IV) De-registering your account
You can contact Live Chat Service or you can ask for help through the contact
                    information at the beginning of this article, we will assist you in closing your account.
After you voluntarily de-register your account, we will stop providing
                    you with products or services, delete your PI according to applicable laws, or anonymize
                    it.
(V) Restricting automated decision-making by information system
For some business functions, decisions are made solely based on an automated
                    decision-making mechanism such as information system and algorithm. If these decisions significantly
                    affect your legitimate rights and interests, you have the right to ask for our explanation and we
                    will make proper remedies.
(VI) Responding to your above-mentioned requests
For security, you might be required to submit written requests or prove your
                    identity by other means. We might ask you to verify your identity before handling your requests.
Generally, we will reply to you within 7 business days. If you are not satisfied,
                    you may submit a complaint through our Live Chat service,
Submit a Complaint
on PC
(please click)
or by the contact
                    information at the beginning of this article.
We may reject requests that are not directly
                        related to you, or unnecessarily repetitive or require massive technological input (such as
                        developing new systems or modifying the existing practices fundamentally), or are detrimental to
                        the legitimate rights and interests of others, or are very impracticable.
We will not be able to respond to your request under the following
                    circumstances:
1. Where it is related to national security or defense security;
2. Where it is related to public security, public health or major public interests;
3. Where it is related to criminal investigations, prosecutions, trials and enforcement of court
                    decisions;
4. Where there is sufficient evidence that the PI subject is subjectively malicious or abuses his or
                    her rights;
5. Where responding to your request will cause serious harm to your legitimate rights and interests,
                    or those of other individuals or organizations;
6. Where trade secrets are involved.
VI. How We Handle Minors' PI
The products, website and services of MachTop are mainly targeted for adul class="li-pointer"ts, so minors
            as not our target users (the age of minors is determined according to the laws of the country where you are
            located and the cultural practices of different countries and regions) and we will not deliberately collect
            the PI of minors. Meanwhile, we urge the guardians to take the initiative in participating in and paying
            attention to the activities, interests and hobbies of minors. If MachTop discovers that the PI of a minor
            is collected without prior consent of the guardian, such PI will be deleted.
VII. How Your PI is Transferred Worldwide
(1) Purpose of Cross-Border Data Transfer
We utilize global resources and servers to provide products or services. Cross-border data transfers occur as a necessary part of our core business processes to fulfill essential operational requirements.
(2) Scope and Destination of Personal Information in Cross-Border Transfers
The personal information involved in cross-border transfers includes: email, country of origin, name, gender, company name, phone number, delivery address, and nickname. Your personal information will be synchronized between our data centers in the United States, Germany, and China. This means your data will be transferred, stored, and processed on servers located in these countries. This transfer is essential to ensure the continuous and high-quality service we offer.
(3) Obtaining Your Consent
By registering and using our services, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in our data centers in the United States, Germany, and China. We will implement strict security measures to protect your data and ensure it is used solely for the legitimate purposes described in this policy. If you do not agree, you may choose "Disagree," which could impact our ability to provide services to you.
We will transfer your personal information to our data centers in the United States, Germany, and China based on your explicit consent.
(4) Risk Disclosure
Please be aware that data protection laws in other countries may differ from those in your home country, meaning that the level of protection for your personal information might vary. Despite our stringent security measures, there remains some risk associated with cross-border data transfers. We regularly assess and update our data protection practices to ensure that your personal information receives the highest level of protection even during cross-border transfers.
(5) Protection Measures
After collecting your information, we store your personal data in our self-operated data centers and encrypt it according to security control requirements before storing it. The data is then transmitted abroad via database synchronization, using the HTTPS protocol to ensure the security of the transmission channel.
During cross-border data transmission, a dedicated line is used. Real-time, bidirectional synchronization of data is achieved through an international dedicated line. As this is real-time synchronization at the database level, data flow remains consistent throughout its lifecycle, with updates at any point being immediately synchronized across all locations.
Only authorized company maintenance personnel can remotely access data stored in overseas data centers. We strictly monitor and audit all access activities.
