This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of UK, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
B. Arbitration

Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in UK, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parities connect to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts located in Singapore. Use of the site is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Agreement, including without limitation, this section. You and Invitation Maker agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the App (including, but not limit to, any services provided or made available therein) or this Agreement must commence within (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. Should you have a dispute with one or more users, or an outside party, you release Invitation Maker (and Invitation Maker's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, creators and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. Invitation Maker encourages users to report user-to-user disputes to your local law enforcement, postmaster general, or a certified mediation or arbitration entity, as applicable. Invitation Maker, for the benefit of users, may try to help users resolve disputes. Invitation Maker does so in INVITATIONMAKER's sole discretion, and Invitation Maker has no obligation to resolve disputes between users or between users and outside parties. To the extent that Invitation Maker attempts to resolve a dispute, Invitation Maker will do so in good faith based solely on INVITATIONMAKER's policies. Invitation Maker will not make judgements regarding legal issues or claims.

C. Entire Agreement/Severability
This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Invitation Maker in connection with the App, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Invitation Maker concerning the App. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.
D. No Waiver
No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and INVITATIONMAKER's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
