visitors or users of our Platform who are under the age of 16.
                      To the extent that you upload images or other data featuring or about a current child under 16, we may collect this information, with your express consent and representation that you have the right to upload this information.

Connecting to ‚ÄúGoogle Photos‚Äù:
Our Platform enables you to upload your Materials to your Google Photos account from within the Photomyne apps.
            To start uploading photos to Google Photos, you have to configure access to your Google Photos account first.
            Once you have connected to your Google Photos account and in order to upload your Materials, you will be asked to give Photomyne permission to add photos to your Google Photos account.
            This action does not grant Photomyne access to your existing photos at Google Photos other than the Materials uploaded through Photomyne.
            This is following a security protocol set by Google.
            To disconnect Photomyne from Google Photos, go to the ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô window in the Photomyne Apps and click the ‚ÄòDisconnect from Google Photos‚Äô button.
            Once the authorization is granted, we will also receive your full name, Gmail address and Gmail account picture which will be presented in the ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô window in the Photomyne Apps to inform you whether or not you are connected to your Google Photos account.
            Furthermore, if you‚Äôre an Android user your Gmail address might be used as part of the ‚ÄòGoogle Sign In‚Äô process should you decide to sign in or re- connect to your Google Photos account this way.
            We will not use this information for any other purpose.
The Photomyne Apps offer various ways to share the Materials you scanned or uploaded.
            Once you have shared your Materials and other Personal Information or information with others (via various channels available through the Photomyne Apps), or submitted Materials for public use, it may be re-shared by others.
            You are solely responsible for your decision to share your Materials and other Personal Information with others and/or to make your Materials and other Personal Information and information visible by others.
Please keep in mind that you must be legally authorized to share with others the information that does not belong to you, such as information pertaining to another person.
            If you are posting information of a known child under 16, you must be their parent or legal guardian.
Your Materials, other Personal Information, and any other information that you voluntarily post on the Platform, such as through your profile, may become visible by the public on the Platform, if you choose to share such data using one of the methods described herein.
Here is an explanation of what it means to share Materials, in terms of your privacy and your produced content.
Posting or submitting Materials for public display:
Posting or submitting Materials for public display through the Photomyne Apps means that you consent to and give Photomyne permission to publish such Materials (including for editorial and advertising purposes).
            The Materials will be public and visible to people online, outside of the Photomyne Apps.
            Such Materials could also find their way to strangers on the web.
            We have no control over how other people may interact with your published Materials (taking a screenshot, downloading the photo or other Materials, etc.).
            Please keep that in mind before posting or submitting such Materials or any other content for public use.
Sharing Materials through the Photomyne Apps (generated web link):
Choosing to share Materials through the Photomyne apps‚Äô sharing option generates a unique web link which you can then pass on to your contacts and recipients.
            Anyone with that web link can have access to the Materials you shared.
            We have no control over how other people you shared your Materials with via the web link may interact with your content (taking a screenshot, downloading the photo or video, etc. or passing the web link on to others).
            This means it‚Äôs possible that your shared Materials could find their way to strangers on the web.
            To minimize the risk of unauthorized use of your content, the generated web link will work for a maximum of 1 year (365 days), after which it will become invalid.
Sharing Materials by using the Photomyne Share App:
Choosing to share Materials through the Photomyne Share App (‚ÄúPhotomyne Share‚Äù) generates a unique code which you can then pass on to your contacts and recipients.
            Anyone with that code can have access to the Materials you shared through Photomyne Share.
            We have no control over how other people you shared your Materials with via Photomyne Share may interact with your content (taking a screenshot, downloading the photo or video, etc. or passing the code on to others).
            This means it‚Äôs possible that your shared Materials could find their way to strangers on the web.
            To minimize the risk of unauthorized use of your content, the generated unique code will work for a maximum of 24 hours, after which it will become invalid.
We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the following categories of sources:
Directly from you or your representatives. For example, information that our customers provide to us related to a transaction or Material that our customers scan with the Apps or upload to the Apps.
Operating systems and platforms. For example, we collect information about your device‚Äôs interaction with our website and apps.
Our vendors. For example, if you interact with Apple, Google, or any other platform or social media account while using our services, we may receive information from your account, including your name, profile picture, email address, and any information defined as public pursuant to the policies of such platforms.
We collect Personal Information to:
To provide our Services, including generative AI technology and enable you to carry out the main purpose for which you requested our Services, for example to scan, save, share and safeguard your scans and to retrieve your content should anything happen;

To host, store and otherwise process information needed for business continuity and disaster recovery;
To evaluate or conduct a merger, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or similar corporate transaction or proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us is among the assets transferred.
We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).
            Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use.
            Making information such as online identifiers or browsing activity available to these companies may be considered a ‚Äúsale‚Äù or ‚Äúsharing‚Äù under California law. According to California consumer privacy law, a ‚Äúsale‚Äù includes disclosing, making available or communicating Personal Information to a third party (except our service providers or contractors) in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.
            ‚ÄúSharing‚Äù includes disclosing, making available or communicating Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for any monetary or valuable consideration.
Currently, and in the preceding 12 months, we have sold or shared to third parties the following categories of Personal Information:

In the event you withdraw your consent and there are no more legitimate grounds for the processing, your Personal Information will be removed within the time period required by applicable laws.
Unless otherwise provided in this Policy, we will keep your Personal Information while you have an account with us or while we are providing services to you.
        Thereafter, we will keep your Personal Information for as long as is necessary:
To respond to any questions, complaints or claims made by you or on your behalf.
To provide services as contracted for by you.

Definitions:
As used in this policy, ‚Äúbiometric data‚Äù includes both ‚Äúbiometric identifiers‚Äù and ‚Äúbiometric information‚Äù as defined in the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS ¬ß 14/1 to 14/99, and elsewhere.
              In addition to Illinois, there are other states with biometric laws, such as Texas and Washington, along with states with comprehensive data privacy laws that address the handling of biometric data or information.
              This policy is designed to be as broad as possible to cover the allowable uses and restrictions in each of the individual jurisdictions.
‚ÄúBiometric identifier‚Äù is defined to include a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or record of scan of hand or face geometry.
              However, biometric identifiers do not include writing samples, written signatures, photographs, demographic data, tattoo descriptions, or physical descriptions such as height, weight, hair color, or eye color.
              Other laws may provide for additional modes of identification and additional exceptions from the definition of ‚Äúbiometric identifier‚Äù or ‚Äúbiometric information.‚Äù
‚ÄúBiometric information‚Äù means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual‚Äôs biometric identifier used to identify an individual.
              Biometric information does not include information derived from items or procedures excluded under the definition of biometric identifiers.
Purpose for Collection of Biometric Data
Photomyne and/or our service providers pursuant to appropriate data sharing agreements, may collect, store, and use biometric data solely for the purpose of providing you with the Services that you choose to use.
            To provide some of the features, Photomyne uses generative AI and models that are trained on content (which may include images or voice recordings) that you provide.
            Generative AI may process biometric data. Photomyne does NOT use biometric data to identify you or any individual.
Disclosure
Photomyne will not disclose or disseminate biometric data to anyone other than its service providers that process biometric data on behalf of Photomyne in furtherance of Photomyne‚Äôs services to its users unless:
We obtain your (and/or the legally authorized representative of the individual‚Äôs whose data is to be processed) consent to such disclosure or dissemination;
The disclosed data completes a transaction that you requested or authorized;
Disclosure is required by state or federal law or municipal ordinance; or
Disclosure is required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Service providers who assist Photomyne with its processes, including but not limited to the maintenance of servers, disposal or recycling of equipment, shall also be encompassed within Photomyne‚Äôs authorized recipients and holders of biometric data provided that a valid data sharing agreement is in place with each such vendor.
Data Retention Schedule
Photomyne, and its service providers, retain biometric data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services for which the data is processed, collected, stored, or used.
            Normally, Photomyne deletes biometric data, and any generative models created using biometric data, within 30 days.
            In any event, in the absence of an overriding legal duty to retain the data, biometric data is permanently destroyed when the purpose for collecting the data has been satisfied, and not later than the first anniversary of the date the purpose for collecting data expires, or within three years of your last interaction with Photomyne, whichever occurs first.
Data Storage
Photomyne shall use reasonable security measures to store, transmit and protect from unauthorized disclosure all biometric data collected under this policy.
            Such storage, transmission, and protection from disclosure shall be performed in a manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which Photomyne stores, transmits and protects from disclosure other confidential and sensitive information, including Personal Information, that can be used to uniquely identify an individual or an individual‚Äôs account or property, such as financial account numbers.
            Photomyne also has internal procedures for responding to security incidents and providing notices if required by law.
Consent
Photomyne will collect your biometric data only with your consent.
            You may withdraw your consent at any time through the App‚Äôs settings (‚ÄúBiometric information policy consent‚Äù).
Exercising Your Rights
To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by Email:
support@photomyne.com
.
Please mention the right you seek to exercise (example, Right to be Forgotten) in the email message‚Äôs subject field or in the subject of your letter.
        Please also advise us which state or country you are a resident of.
You may also submit your request by opening a Photomyne app‚Äôs side-menu and selecting Help & Support; and Email us.
        In your message, please mention the right you seek to exercise (example, Right to be Forgotten) in the message‚Äôs subject field.
You may be limited in the number of verifiable consumer requests for access or data portability in any given 12-month period (for example, twice per 12-month period for California residents).
The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or a legally authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Before responding to your privacy rights request, we must verify your identity.
            We will do so by matching at least two reliable data points from your request to the information that we maintain about you.
            For certain more sensitive Personal Information, we may require further verification, including obtaining the consumer‚Äôs signed declaration under penalty of perjury to further confirm that the requestor is the consumer.
            Once you contact us to exercise your rights, we will further guide you as to our verification process.
            However, please note that we will not verify your identity where not permitted under privacy laws, such as for opt-out of sale or sharing or limit use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information rights under certain privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
        Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
        We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor‚Äôs identity or authority to make the request.
Under certain circumstances, we may deny your request for the reasons permitted by the applicable law, which we will specifically identify for you.
Appeal Process:
You have the right to appeal our denial of a rights request.
        If you would like to appeal a denial of a rights request, please contact us via email at
support@photomyne.com
.
        Photomyne will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to an appeal not later than the 60th day after the date of receipt of the appeal, including a written explanation of the reason or reasons for the decision.
        If you remain unsatisfied with the resolution of your appeal, you can file a complaint with the Office of the Attorney General in your State of residence (for U.S. residents).
        In our appeal response, we will provide you with the information on how a complaint may be filed with the Office of the Attorney General of your State of residence.
If you are a United Kingdom or a European Union resident and remain unhappy with a response you receive from Photomyne, you have a right to contact your data protection supervisory authority (see https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080 for Europe, or https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint for the United Kingdom).
Authorized Agents
Only you or a person that you or your employer authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information.
        You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
        You may use an authorized agent to submit a privacy rights request on your behalf if you provide the authorized agent a written permission signed by you or give the authorized agent power of attorney.
        We may also require you to do either of the following, unless the authorized agent provides power of attorney documentation:
Verify your own identity directly with us.
Directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
We may deny a request from an authorized agent if the agent cannot or does not provide to us your signed permission demonstrating that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf or if you do not confirm to us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
The requirement to obtain and provide written permission from the consumer does not apply to requests made by an opt-out preference signal.
Response Timing and Format
We will acknowledge your request no later than ten (10) business days after receiving your request to delete, request to correct, or request to know and provide information about how we will process the request.
        The information provided shall describe in general our verification process and when you should expect a response, except in instances where we have already granted or denied the request.
We shall respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 calendar days of its receipt.
        If you are a European Resident, we will respond within 30 days of receiving your written request.
        If we require more time (up to 90 days, unless a different time period is allowed by law), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
        We will deliver our written response by email.
        For California residents, any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request‚Äôs receipt, unless you request us to provide Personal Information beyond the 12-month period, as long as it was collected on or after January 1, 2022.
        The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
        For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
        If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
        For example, in cases where requests from a consumer are distinctly unsubstantiated or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either charge a reasonable fee, in our discretion, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or refuse to act on the request altogether.
We honor opt-out preference signals.
        An opt-out preference signal is a signal that is sent by a platform, technology or mechanism on your behalf that communicates your choice to opt-out of the sharing for targeted advertisements or sale of your personal information.
        You can learn more about implementing opt-out preference signals
here
or by exploring other developing technologies and services that offer this tool.
We treat opt-out preference signals as valid requests to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information under privacy laws.
        Ordinarily, your opt-out preference signal is sufficient for us to honor your request, but in some instances we may request additional information to help facilitate your request for offline sales or sharing.
        We will not use, disclose or retain this additional information for any purpose other than to facilitate the request.
However, while we honor opt-out preference signals, we do not respond to ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù requests because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret such signals.
Photomyne has reasonable technical, physical and administrative security measures in place to prevent Personal Information from being accidentally lost or used or accessed in an unauthorized way.
        These measures offer appropriate reasonable security level, taking into account the state of the technology, the implementation costs and also the nature, the scale, the context and the processing purposes.
        We limit access to your Personal Information to those who have a genuine business need to access it.
        Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
        The measures are also intended to prevent unnecessary collection and further processing of Personal Information.
        The Personal Information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.
