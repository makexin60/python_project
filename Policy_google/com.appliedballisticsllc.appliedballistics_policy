Personal information you provide to us is collected directly from you for the purposes of providing the Services, including fulfilling your requests to us, processing payment information, communicating with you, and screening our Services for potential risks or fraud. If you elect to provide us with your personal information, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the outlined disclosures regarding the collection, use, and transfer of your information.

We process this information to complete payments and authenticate hardware and software licenses throughout the lifecycle of the product.
Limited Location Information.
Certain Services allow users to consent to the use of their GPS coordinates (geolocation) of their mobile application which we use for the sole purpose of retrieving and providing local weather and atmospheric conditions to the mobile application. The Services utilize a third party service (OpenWeatherMap) to provide this weather information. We do not store or retain this geolocation information.
Form Submissions.
Information that you provide by filling in forms in the Services. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use the Services, subscribing to our service, and requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with the Services.
Automatic Information Collection

Categories of personal information we collect automatically through use of the Services includes:
Usage Details.
When you access and use the Services, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the Services.

Device Information.
We collect certain information about mobile devices, including Apple installation instance identifiers of IOS users, Android instance identifiers of users of mobile applications, and IP address log files of mobile application users. We may also collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including operating system, browser type, and mobile network information.

Stored Information and Files.
The Services also may access metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your mobile device.
Location Information.
When you opt-in to allowing use of your location, the Services collect real-time information about the location of your device. For example, certain products can use information regarding your current location to determine current weather conditions to assist in calculating firing solutions.
Third-Party Information Collection
Certain third parties may use automatic information collection technologies, including cross-site tracking technologies, to collect personal information about you or your device. These third parties may include, but are not limited to, your internet service provider, your web browser, your mobile service provider, your mobile device manufacturer, online advertisers, and data analytics companies. We do not control these third parties or how they collect, use, or disclose your personal information. As stated, this Privacy Policy is not applicable to third party collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. If you have any questions about the privacy practices of any third party, you may contact the responsible third party directly.
Disclosure of Your Information
We may disclose aggregated and analytical information about our users, such as information that does not allow identification of any individual or device, without restriction.
We may disclose any personal data we collect from you on the legal basis that it is necessary for the performance of our contract with you regarding your use of the Services or in preparation to entering into this contract with you. Certain information is disclosed on the basis of our prevailing legitimate interest as it may be necessary for providing certain features of the Services, improving our customer service, and your user experience with the Services.
In addition, we may disclose information that we collect or you provide:
To our vendors, service providers, and contractors (nVisti, LLC, Amazon Web Services, and Shopify) to help us provide our Services and fulfill obligations to you. These service providers and contractors may include database and cloud service providers, online store platforms, payment processors, and professional services such as legal and accounting. We disclose personal information to our vendors, service providers, and contractors for legitimate business purposes associated with providing the Services.
To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Applied Ballistics Inc.’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Applied Ballistics Inc. about the Services users is among the assets transferred.
To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
With your consent.
To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including responding to any government or regulatory request.
To enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including the Services EULA, terms of sale, and for billing and collection.
If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Applied Ballistic, Inc., our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Transfer of personal information out of the EU
Personal information of citizens of EU member states is transferred to third countries outside the EU (e.g. to the USA and the UK). This generally takes place on the basis of contractual regulations (EU standard contractual clauses) with the recipients of such transfer provided for by law and, where applicable, supplementary technical-organizational guarantees which are intended to ensure adequate protection of your data and which you can view on request. We may also base such data transfer on your consent in certain cases.
Data Security
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We will prevent the use of your subscription of the Services on any devices, other than the device that is specifically associated with your subscription.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through the Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.
Retention and Deletion of Your Personal Information
When you access our Services, we will retain your personal information as long as it is necessary for the processing purpose in question or as required by applicable law. Generally this means that all personal data of users we store is stored for the lifecycle of the associated third party hardware product as it is used in order to authenticate the associated software licenses throughout the product lifecycle. We determine the appropriate retention period based on the nature and sensitivity of the personal information being processed, the risk of harm due to unauthorized access versus the benefit of retention, and whether we can achieve the purposes of processing through other means. We may retain your personal information for longer periods if required by law, if you give us your permission, or in case of a legal dispute in which your personal information may be used as evidence.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may update our privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will make the new privacy policy available with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated.
We do not intend to process the information for any purpose other than that for which it was collected.
The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of this privacy policy. You are responsible for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.

Notice to California Residents
Each capitalized term used, but not defined, in this section shall have the meaning given to such term in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). Personal Information as defined in the CCPA shall be included in personal information as used in this Privacy Policy. If you are a resident of California, you have the right to access the personal information we hold about you, to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, ported, or erased, and to opt out of the sale of your personal information. If you would like to exercise these rights, please contact our Data Controller Contact identified near the beginning of this Privacy Policy. You may optionally designate an authorized agent to submit these requests on your behalf.
Right of Access to Specific Information
: You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable Consumer request, we will disclose to you:
The categories of personal information we collected about you;
The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you;
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing, or selling that personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information;
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request) and provide a copy to you in an electronic or paper format; and
The categories of personal information, if any, we disclosed for a business purpose to a third party.
Deletion Request Right
: You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable Consumer request, we will delete (and direct our Contractors and Service Providers to delete) your personal information from our (and their) records, unless an exception applies (as described below).
As permitted by CCPA we may delete your personal information by (a) permanently and completely erasing the personal information on our existing systems with the exception of archived or back-up systems; (b) de-identifying the personal information; or, (c) aggregating the personal information.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or one of our Contractors or Service Providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.);
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;
Comply with a legal, regulatory or law enforcement obligation; or
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, Correction, and Deletion Rights
: To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable Consumer request to us by calling using the contact information near the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable Consumer request related to your personal information. You may only make a verifiable Consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. To be verifiable, the Consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative of that person; and
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable Consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable Consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Upon receiving a data access, correction, data port or deletion request from you, we will verify your identity based on the information we have on file for you. Upon verification of your identity, we will proceed to process your request (subject to the exceptions stated above).
We endeavor to confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) days of receiving it. We will respond to a verifiable Consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to an additional forty-five (45) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
We will deliver our written response via email to the email address associated with you or, if we are unable to determine your email address, via mail.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable Consumer request receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable Consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
We will not discriminate against you simply for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
Notice to Non-U.S. Residents
Our headquarters is in the United States. The personal information we or our service providers and contractors collect may be stored and processed in servers within or outside of the United States and certain personal information may be accessible by persons or companies outside of the United States who provide services for us. As such, we and our service providers and contractors may transfer your personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.
Where applicable, you acknowledge and consent to our collecting, transmitting, transferring, processing, storing, and otherwise using your personal information outside of the country in which you reside.
Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy or use of our Services constitutes consent, either express, implied, or tacit, to collect, use, and share your personal information as indicated herein.
Notice to European Union and United Kingdom Individuals
If you are a resident of the European Union or the United Kingdom (also referred to as a “Data Subject”), the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) provides you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. This section is provided pursuant to the GDPR and UK GDPR. Each capitalized term used, but not defined, in this section shall have the meaning given to such term in the applicable regulation.
This section describes how we collect, share, disclose, and process the personal information of residents of the European Union and United Kingdom. “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (referred to ‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person and includes all “personal information” referred to in this policy.
If you are a citizen of an EU member stat or your Personal Data is being processed within the EUR you have the following rights as a data subject under GDPR:
Please refer to our contact details (see above) to exercise your rights and to revoke your consent.
You have the right to request information about all Personal Data we process about you at any time.
If your Personal Data is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to have it corrected or completed.
You may request the deletion of your Personal Data at any time, unless we are legally obligated or entitled to continue processing data.
If legal requirements are met, you may request restrictions of the processing of your Personal Data.
You have the right to object to the processing insofar as the data processing is carried out for the purpose of direct advertising or profiling. If the processing is carried out on the basis of a weighing of interests, you may object to the processing by stating the reasons arising from your particular situation.
If the processing is carried out on the basis of consent or within the framework of a contract, you have a right to transfer the data you have provide, unless this impairs the rights and freedoms of other persons.
If we process your Personal Data on the basis of a declaration of consent, you have the right to revoke this consent at any time with effect to the future. The processing carried out before a revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
You also have the right to file a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority at any time if you believe that data processing has been carried out in violation of applicable law.
We will notify all recipients to whom we have disclosed Personal Data of any correction or deletion of your Personal Data or restrictions of the relevant processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. We will inform you of the recipients applicable to you if you request this.
Automatic profiles and data security:
We do not create automatic profiles and we take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the Personal Data we process against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or against unauthorized access.
Applied Ballistics Training Division Policies
Applied Ballistics Training Division reserves the right to removes an attendee from a course due to abuse or harassment of other participants and staff, safety or range violations with or without a weapon, or any indication of being under the influence of alcohol or other substance.
In circumstances were any of the above occurs, a participant will not be provided a refund or any opportunity to attend a future course. Local law enforcement will be involved as the situation necessitates.
It is the legal responsibility of the individual to ensure all federal and state laws regarding storage, transportation, security, carriage, ammunition and firearms are adhered to whilst attending Applied Ballistics Training Courses. This also includes all laws pertaining to open and concealed carry.
A participant may open or concealed carry a sidearm, provided said sidearm holster uses active retention and is of quality construction. This may be determined by the regulations of the host range and or the assessment of ABTD staff. The participant assumes all legal liability and responsibility surrounding the carriage and storage of a sidearm, including federal and state laws regarding such action.
Training may be subject to cancellation if the minimum attendance is not reached 3 weeks prior to the event start date. Notifications and full refunds will then be issued to prospective attendees.
Attendees wishing to cancel will be issued with a refund up to one month before the event start date, minus the value of any products already received. After such time, any deposit of funds plus the value of any materials already received will be retained due to late cancellation.
Applied Ballistics Training Division is not responsible for the cancellation of events due to unforeseen natural disasters or adverse weather conditions. In this instance, a full refund minus the value of any products already received will be issued at the discretion of ABTD.
The Applied Ballistics Training Division ammunition policy provides clear guidelines and direction for shooters attending a course with factory or hand-loaded ammunition.
Ammunition must be of match grade with an ability to consistently group 1 MOA or less.
Ammunition of an armor piecing, tungsten core, steel core, explosive, barrier blind or similar nature is not to be used in any capacity, due to the target damaging effects.
All ammunition should be of the same components and bullet type or factory.
The .30 caliber 168 grain Sierra Match King is dynamically unstable at distances beyond 600 – 700 yards, due to bullet design and construction.
Applied Ballistics Training Division will not provide a refund, nor be held responsible in the event ammunition is unsafe or unable to perform to the expected course consistency standards.
Hand Loaded Ammunition
Shooters may prefer to utilize hand loaded ammunition. Using hand loaded ammunition will allow the shooter to maximize the potential precision of an LR weapon platform. Shooters accept full responsibility for the performance and safety of hand loaded ammunition.
Some ammunition loaded to tighter tolerances may have ejection or chambering issues due to the factors associated with field firing environments and adverse conditions. These factors may result in a failure to eject / stuck cases.
Ammunition which has been loaded to seat the bullet against the lands and requires firing to eject the round will be deemed unsafe. This ammunition will not be permitted for course use.
Match Ammunition
Match ammunition provides greater consistency and tighter precision tolerances than standard factory and hunting ammunition. For this reason, match grade ammunition is required for any Applied Ballistics Training Division LR course.
Using non-match grade ammunition will result in decreased precision and consistency at range, effecting the shooter’s ability to accurately and precisely engage targets.
Powder Testing
During certain courses, shooters may have the opportunity to test powder temperature sensitivity and collect muzzle velocity measurement data at temperature extremes.
Involvement and participation of muzzle velocity testing is at the sole discretion of the individual. The following provides some general guidelines for individuals participating in an ABTD course involving powder temperature sensitivity testing:
Ammunition that has been hand loaded to achieve maximum muzzle velocities in standard temperature ranges may be unsafe for testing at the extreme temperature range.
Due to safety concerns, it’s advisable to note the temperature and muzzle velocity information for hand loaded ammunition before course commencement.
Applied Ballistics Training Division does not accept responsibility for faulty / malfunctioning ammunition, or therein-adverse effects of ammunition being fired at temperature extremes. The attendee is solely responsible for the performance and safety of temperature sensitivity tested ammunition, regardless of hand loading or factory assembly.
Products that are NOT eligible to be returned at any time include, but is not limited to: opened consumable items, clothing that has been worn/ washed or any product not in its undamaged original packaging. ABTD reserves the right to refuse any return or exchange. If you have questions concerning this policy, please contact us at orders@ab.us.com.
