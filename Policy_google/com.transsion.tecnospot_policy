(I) General Description
Tspot is firmly convinced that the basic right to privacy shall not vary as you live around the world. Thus, we
        hold that no matter where a natural person lives, Tspot will treat any information about the natural person that
        has been identified or identifiable, particularly the name, identity information, location data, online
        identifier or data specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological or associated with the
        natural person as "personal information".
We will merely collect information required for specific, concrete, explicit and legitimate purposes, and shall
        warrant that your information will not be further treated in a way contradicting such purposes. If we intend to
        use your personal information for other purposes that are not described in this Privacy Policy, we will seek
        your consent again.
We will collect your personal information in the following three ways, covering 1) the information you directly
        furnish to us (such as the nickname, head portrait, name, telephone number you voluntarily furnish to us when
        you log in to your account or take part in marketing activities held by us); 2) the information that we collect
        through automated means during your use of this software (e.g., equipment information, service log information);
        3) the information we get from other sources.
You shall be entitled to choose whether to furnish personal information when using Tspot's products or services
        or at the request of us. You do not have to provide Tspot with personal information, but in some cases, Tspot
        may become unable to provide you with relevant products or services, or respond to or address your issues if you
        decide not to provide your personal information. We will collect and use your personal information merely for
        the purposes stated in this Policy. The following examples are used to your personal information that we
        collect:
(II) Tspot's primary business functions and scenarios of collection and usage
The primary business function of this software is to furnish you with such services as browsing online contents,
        publishing contents and recommending personalized contents.
1.Furnishing you with the services of account registration and login.
This software account service function is provided by Palm ID, which will provide you with a consistent user
        experience and secure authentication. You can log in and use the same Palm ID account for different
        businesses.
When you register and log in to this software, we will create a Palm ID account for you, and access, collect and
        bind the personal information collected after your expressly authorized consent via indirect access to associate
        the relevant account to our products or services. Palm ID authorizes us to obtain your account ID,
        region/country, and the personal information we ultimately obtain will be based on what Palm ID authorizes. You
        can better understand how Palm ID collects your information by going to the "My" page and accessing the Palm ID
        Privacy Policy on the Palm ID page. Please be assured that we will provide appropriate security measures to
        protect your personal information in accordance with legal requirements and proven industry security
        standards.
Where you refuse to furnish such information, you will not be able to register an account and make use of related
        functions, but your normal use of other functions of Tspot will not be influenced as a result. You may still

        head portrait (covering real portrait), location, email address, date of birth as well as personality signature.
        However, your experience of registration and login will not be influenced as a result of your refusal to furnish
        supplementary information. When you set your head portrait, we will get the permissions of camera, file and
        media of your device. Where you refuse to grant such permissions, we will not be able to revise the head
        portrait. After you have granted such permissions, you can go to "Phone Settings -> Application Management ->

        relevant countries on the protection of personal privacy data. Where not prohibited by local laws and
        regulations, we may also store the collected personal information in a country or region other than the country
        where we do business.
Currently, Tspot may store your personal information in India and Ireland. Specifically:
The personal information we collect and generate in our Indian operations will be stored in servers seated in
        India.

No matter whether the personal information is stored in the country where the business is located or in other
        countries or regions without violating the laws and regulations, we will keep it in accordance with the relevant
        laws and regulations on data storage. In the meanwhile, we will implement the essential security measures while
        taking into account the characteristics, scope, purpose, possible risks in the treatment of personal
        information, as well as the serious consequences once the damage is caused. For example, we will apply

        strict confidentiality agreement with authorized partners, requiring them to deal with personal information by
        means of relevant confidentiality and security measures in accordance with this Policy as well as the applicable
        laws of your jurisdiction. Apart from that, we will request them to furnish data security functions and
        information security qualifications (e.g., level protection assessment, information security management system,
        and the like). When we embed the SDK of authorized partners or other similar applications in this software, we
        will fulfill the obligation of prudence and request the SDK for acquiring information to protect your data
        security.

        asset transfer as well as other related transactions we will require the new companies and organizations holding
        your personal information to continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy through agreements or other appropriate

        region and acquiring your authorization consent, we may transfer your personal information to the resources or
        servers mentioned in Article 3 of this Policy for storage or treatment. Besides, we may transfer your personal
        information to third-party service providers and business partners, so your data may also be transferred to
        other countries or regions as well. The privacy laws of these countries may not be exactly the same, and the
        jurisdictions where these servers are situated may or may not protect personal information based on the same
        standards as yours. However, we will still do our utmost to protect your personal information in compliance with
        our Privacy Policy and realize the corresponding cross-border transfer as well as other treatment of personal
        information in line with the legal requirements of the country or region where the personal information is
        situated.

        third-party service providers, we will observe the relevant applicable laws. We will take appropriate security

        applicable local data protection laws.
VI. Your Rights to Your Personal information
We fully understand and respect your rights such as confirmation, access, correction, deletion, withdrawal of
        consent and complaint (hereinafter referred to as "requests") about your personal information as a data subject,
        and such rights will also be subject to specific exclusions and exceptions in accordance with applicable laws.
        Moreover, we will take active measures to guarantee that your rights are protected in an effective way. However,
        please understand and note that we may need to verify your identity before processing your request for security
        reasons. For your legitimate and reasonable request, we do not charge in principle. However, in terms of
        repeated requests beyond the reasonable limit, we will charge a certain reasonable fee within the scope
        permitted by applicable laws based on the actual management expenses as appropriate. We may reject requests that
        are unprovoked and repeated, which require too many technical means (e.g., to develop new systems or
        fundamentally change existing practices), pose a risk to the legitimate interests of others or are highly
        impractical, or requests to violate any mandatory requirement of the law.
1. Confirmation and access rights

        in the form of Privacy Policy or notice under concrete product and service scenarios. You are entitled to

        it, some functions that may only be used only after your explicit authorization cannot be used as a result of
        it. For the personal information you have furnished to us, you may directly inquire about it in the interface of
        our products or services. For cases where you cannot check, you may send an email to Privacy@tecno.com or use

        for correction or deletion by sending an email to Privacy@tecno.com or using the FEEDBACK function within these

        transaction data and Tspot is legally obliged to keep the record of this transaction to observe applicable local
        laws. Please also note that if you request to delete your information from our products and services, we may not
        delete the corresponding information from the backup system forthwith owing to some applicable local laws and
        technical restrictions, but we will securely store your personal information and prevent it from being treated
        to a further extent until the backup system is updated, your information may be deleted or your information is
        anonymized.

VII. How We Process Personal Information of Children
Tspot's products and services will not be furnished to children who are 14 years old or under the equivalent age
        prescribed by the laws of your jurisdiction (since the standards for determining children's age are not exactly
        the same in different countries or regions, we will principally define children specifically in accordance with
        the laws and regulations of the countries or regions where we develop our business). We will neither actively
        collect children's personal data, nor make use of children's personal information for marketing purposes. If you
        find that information about a child has been passed to us, please send an email to Privacy@tecno.com or contact
        us by using the FEEDBACK function within these services, and we will delete the relevant information as soon as
        possible. If we find that we have collected children's personal information, we will do what we can to delete
        the relevant content with the least delay possible.

        third parties, and some third-party products or services may be carried out by SDK as well as other methods. You
        can choose whether to access or accept the websites, products and services provided by third parties at your
        sole discretion. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any products or services offered by a third party. Since
        we cannot actually control the third party, we will not be held accountable for the third party's collection and
        processing of your personal information. When you submit any information to the third party, please carefully
        learn about the Privacy Policy of the third party and attach importance to protecting your personal
        information.
