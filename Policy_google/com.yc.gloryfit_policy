2. How do we
use cookies and similar technologies
2.1 Cookie
To ensure
that websites work properly, we store small data files called cookies on
computers or mobile devices sometimes. A cookie is a plain text file that a web
server stores on a computer or mobile device. The content of a cookie can only
be retrieved or read by the server that created it. Each cookie is unique to
your web browser or mobile application. Cookies often contain identifiers, site
names, and some numbers and characters. With cookies, the website can store
data such as user preferences or products in the shopping basket.
The purpose
of enabling cookies for most large websites or Internet service providers is to
improve the user experience. With cookies, a website can remember a user's
single visit (using session cookies) or multiple visits (using a permanent
cookie). With cookies, websites can save settings such as the language of the
computer or mobile device, font size, and other browsing preferences. This
means that users do not need to reconfigure user preferences every time they
visit. If a website does not use cookies, it will be treated as new visitors
each time a user opens a webpage. For example, if you log in to a website and
go to another webpage, the website will not recognize you and you will be
logged out again.
The company
will not use cookies for any purpose other than those described in this policy.
You can manage or delete cookies according to your preferences. For details,
see AboutCookies.org. You can clear all cookies saved on your computer, and
most web browsers have a cookie-blocking feature. However, if you do this, you
will need to change your user settings personally each time you visit our site.
For more information on how to change your browser settings, visit the
following links: <Internet Explorer>, <Google Chrome>, <Mozilla
Firefox>, <Safari>, and <Opera>.
2.2 Web
Beacons and Pixel Tags
In addition
to the cookies, we use other technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags on
our websites. For example, an e-mail sent by our company to you may contain a
click-through URL that links to the content of our website. If you click on the
link, the company will track this click to help us understand your product and
service preferences and improve customer service. Web beacons are usually
transparent images embedded in websites or emails. With the pixel tag in the
email, we can tell if the email was opened. If you do not want your activity to
be tracked this way, you can unsubscribe from our company's mailing list at any
time.
2.3 Do Not
Track (Do Not Track)
Many web
browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that can issue Do Not Track
requests to websites. At present, major Internet standards organizations have
not yet set up policies to specify how websites should respond to such
requests. However, if your browser has "Do Not Track"enabled, all of
our website will respect your choice.
3. How Do We
Disclose Your Personal Data

will not sell your personal data to the third parties. However, the company

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

附录：相关定义
一、本隐私政策的适用范围
本政策适用于本政策第二条所述高德提供的各项产品和服务。
您即用户
在使用第三方（简称“
开发者
”）开发和/或运营的集成了高德地图开放平台部分产品和服务（例如：SDK等）等产品（简称“
开发者应用
”）及包含开发者应用的终端时，我们会通过开发者应用向您提供相应互联网地图服务，包括地图、搜索、定位、路线规划、导航等（详见下述第二条列举，统称为

（2）为了确保用户能够在充分知情并明示同意本政策的情况下使用高德产品和服务，且保证高德能够合法地获取必要的个人信息以为用户提供相关服务，开发者应当按照我们的要求在开发者应用的“隐私政策”中明确说明其应用集成的高德地图开放平台产品和服务的情况（包含我们的公司名称、使用的具体产品、使用目的等）、我们为提供相关服务而收集的用户个人信息、以及本政策访问链接并确保用户可以点击链接查看本政策，并且应确保以显著的、可有效触达用户的方式告知用户，以获得用户对于我们处理其相关个人信息的充分、有效且明确的同意。如果用户未作出同意，则开发者不应继续使用高德产品和服务。开发者的继续使用行为，视为开发者已经同意并向高德保证开发者所有的用户已同意高德收集和使用用户信息。
（3）如果开发者应用的用户是未满14周岁的未成年人，请开发者务必确保就用户使用高德地图开放平台产品和服务时我们处理用户个人信息事宜获得该用户的监护人的充分、有效且明确的同意。
（4）开发者应当始终遵守处理用户个人信息有关的所有可适用的法律、法规、标准、政策和监管要求处理用户的个人信息，充分保护用户的个人信息安全，并对其处理用户个人信息的行为向用户负责。开发者应当并已经向用户提供易于操作的访问、更正、删除其个人信息，撤销或更改其授权同意、注销其个人账号等用户权利实现机制。若开发者认为使用高德地图开放平台产品和服务将会导致开发者的应用不符合相关法律、法规、标准、政策或监管要求，则开发者可以联系我们，也可以停止使用高德地图开放平台产品和服务。如果由于开发者的原因致使我们遭受任何形式的投诉、调查、处罚等，开发者应负责全面给予解决；如因此导致我们或用户发生损失的，开发者应负责全额赔偿。
2、高德希望开发者应用以符合相应法律法规的方式处理用户的个人信息，但高德无法控制开发者及其应用如何处理开发者所控制的用户个人信息，因此高德也无法为开发者的行为负责。高德建议用户务必认真阅读和充分了解开发者应用的相关服务协议和隐私政策，并在同意开发者应用的隐私政策后再使用开发者应用。
3、当用户使用开发者应用时，用户可以到开发者应用中的隐私政策中查看该应用中集成的高德地图开放平台产品和服务情况、我们为提供相关服务而收集的用户的个人信息类型、使用目的、以及本政策访问链接。您可以通过上述应用的隐私政策中所透出的本政策访问链接点击查找和阅读本政策的具体内容，并且当用户同意开发者应用的隐私政策时或用户开始使用高德地图开放平台产品或服务时，即表示用户已经完全理解和同意本政策，并对于我们处理用户的相关个人信息给予了充分、有效且明确的授权和同意。
二、我们如何收集和使用您的个人信息
为实现向您提供下述各项高德产品和服务，您须授权我们收集、使用必要的信息。
如您拒绝提供相应信息，您将无法正常使用高德产品和服务。
同时在开发者决定的调用权限范围内，我们会调用您的一些设备权限，您可以在设备的设置功能或“隐私设置”中查看权限状态，并可自行选择开启或关闭部分或全部权限。
请您注意，您一旦关闭任一权限即代表您取消了授权，我们将不再基于对应权限继续处理相关个人信息，也无法为您提供该权限所对应的服务。
但是，您关闭权限的决定不会影响此前基于您的授权所进行的个人信息处理。
我们在此特别提醒您：
因我们向您提供的产品和服务种类众多，不同用户选择使用的具体产品/服务范围存在差异，用户使用具体产品/服务时
的设备和系统（安卓/iOS）及系统版本存在差异，
开发者在集成、使用高德产品和服务时决定的权限存在差异，会导致不同高德产品和服务收集使用的个人信息类型、范围会有所区别，因此开发者应对高德产品和服务实际收集的个人信息、调用的权限及关闭方式等内容向用户进行说明，请用户以开发者说明的内容为准。

1、您使用高德产品或服务期间，我们将持续为您保存，除非您申请删除个人信息。
2、当您申请删除个人信息后，我们将及时采取措施将您的个人信息从业务功能系统删除，使其保持不可被检索、访问的状态。

（二）存储地域
我们在中华人民共和国境内运营中收集和产生的个人信息，将
存储在中国境内
。
但是，如果用户在中国境外使用集成了高德产品和服务的开发者应用时，我们可能会将部分信息传输至用户的位于中国境外的移动终端上。
我们会严格按照相应法律法规的规定执行，并保证用户的个人信息安全。
用户理解并同意，若用户在中国境外使用开发者应用中集成的我们提供产品或服务时，我们收集的有关用户的个人信息仍会存储到我们在境内的服务器上。
我们要求，并且开发者应当确保针对该使用场景有关此项数据在中国大陆存储已经取得用户的明确有效的同意；否则，由此引发的一切风险及后果由开发者自行承担；高德因此遭受任何形式的诉请、诉求、投诉、处罚等的，开发者将负责全面给予解决；如果导致高德发生任何形式的损失，开发者负责给予我们全额赔偿。
我们要求，并且开发者承诺已清楚知晓并完全理解，不同国家或地区对于数据及个人信息的收集、存储、使用、共享等处理各有其监管要求。未经高德的另行事先书面许可，开发者不得仅根据
《高德地图开放平台服务协议》
[2]
等平台线上协议而以任何方式将集成了高德地图开放平台产品和服务的开发者应用提供给中国境外的其他国家或地区的自然人使用。若开发者未经高德事先书面许可，擅自将集成了前述开发者应用提供给中国境外的其他国家或地区的自然人使用，因此导致的所有风险及后果均由开发者自行承担；并且，如高德因此遭受任何形式的诉请、诉求、投诉、处罚等的，开发者将负责全面给予解决；如导致高德或用户发生任何形式的损失，开发者负责给予赔偿。同时，高德将保留停止提供相关服务的权利。
以下情形下，我们会在履行法律规定的义务后，向可能的境外实体提供您的个人信息：
1、适用的法律有明确规定；
2、获得您的单独同意；
3、为了履行与您订立的合同。
针对以上情形，我们会按照本政策依法保护您的个人信息安全。
（三）安全措施
1、数据保护技术措施
我们会采取符合业界标准、合理可行的安全防护措施保护您的个人信息，防止个人信息遭到未经授权访问、公开披露、使用、修改、损坏或丢失。例如，我们会使用加密技术提高个人信息的安全性，在您的浏览器与服务器之间交换数据时受 SSL协议加密保护，我们提供HTTPS协议安全浏览方式；我们会使用受信赖的保护机制防止个人信息遭到恶意攻击；我们会部署访问控制机制，尽力确保只有授权人员才可访问个人信息。目前，我们的重要信息系统已经通过网络安全等级保护的测评和ISO27001、ISO27701认证。
2、数据保护管理组织措施
我们建立了行业内先进的以数据为核心、围绕数据生命周期进行的数据安全管理体系，从组织建设、制度设计、人员管理及产品技术的维度提升个人信息的安全性。我们通过培训课程和考试，不断加强员工对于保护个人信息重要性的认识。
（四）个人信息安全事件的响应
如果我们的物理、技术或管理防护设施遭到破坏，导致信息被非授权访问、公开披露、篡改或毁坏，导致您的合法权益受损的，我们会及时启动应急预案，采取合理必要的措施，以尽可能降低对您个人的影响。如发生个人信息安全事件，我们还将按照法律法规的要求向开发者告知安全事件的基本情况和可能的影响、我们已采取或将要采取的处置措施、开发者和用户可自主防范和降低风险的建议、对您的补救措施。因我们并无您的联系方式，我们将以邮件推送通知及其他合理渠道告知开发者，并采取合理、有效的方式发布公告，由开发者告知用户个人信息安全事件。同时，我们还将按照监管部门要求，上报个人信息安全事件的处置情况。
（五）特别提示
1、互联网并非绝对安全的环境，电子邮件、信息发布、社交软件、交易平台等与其他用户的交流方式无法
确定是否完全加密，请您在进行交互使用时，注意保护您个人信息的安全。
2、请您理解，由于计算机及互联网技术的飞速发展及同步速度的限制，可能存在或出现各种恶意或非恶意的攻击手段。
虽然高德持续致力于提升和加强安全措施，以保护您的信息免遭意外或破坏，但仍无法始终保证信息的百分之百安全。
3、您使用产品或服务时所用的系统和通讯网络，或硬件设备等高德均无法控制，
请您了解并注意保护您的个人信息安全。
4、您的个人信息经匿名化处理后将形成可以使用及流通的数据，高德对此类数据的保存及处理无需另行通知并征得您的同意。

（一）适用法律
本政策的执行、解释及争议的解决均适
用中华人民共和国法律，且不考虑任何冲突法。
（二）争议解决

七、政策的更新

若开发者不同意更新后的本政策，可以停止使用相应的高德地图开放平台产品和服务。若开发者在更新后的本政策生效后继续使用相应的高德地图开放平台产品和服务，即表示开发者已同意更新后的本政策，并同意将本政策的最新版本及变更说明以可有效触达的方式通知并重新取得用户授权，以获取用户对本政策更新版本的完整、合法、有效的同意。
若用户不同意更新后的本政策，可以停止使用已集成高德地图开放平台产品和服务的开发者应用，开发者应向用户提供相应实现机制；若用户在更新后的本政策生效后继续使用已集成高德地图开放平台产品和服务的开发者应用，即表示用户已经充分阅读并同意更新后的本政策。

八、未成年人保护

我们推定您具有相应的民事行为能力。如您为未成年人，我们要求您请您的父母或其他监护人仔细阅读开发者应用的隐私政策和本政策，并在征得您的父母或其他监护人同意的前提下使用我们的服务或向我们提供信息。
我们要求，并且开发者应采取必要的措施确保用户使用开发者应用前均已获得其监护人的同意，同时，开发者应在其应用的隐私政策中履行相应的儿童个人信息处理告知义务。
若您是未成年人的父母或其他监护人，请您关注未成年人是否是在取得您的授权同意之后使用我们的服务。
（二）补救措施
1、如果您未能取得您监护人的同意或您未同意您的被监护人使用我们的服务并向我们提供信息
，
请您或监护人立即停止使用开发者应用中集成的本服务并及时与我们取得联系。
受制于现有技术和业务模式，我们很难主动识别未成年人的个人信息。如我们自己发现前述情形，我们也会主动予以删除，除非法律法规要求我们保留此类信息。
2、在收到您的书面通知而知晓
，高德在未事先获得监护人同意的情况下收集了未成年人的个人信息时，高德会立即停止相关信息收集及使用。
