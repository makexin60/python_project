Some features and/or functionality of the WildWorks Services may be unavailable if you choose not to share certain information. WildWorks may use information you provide to communicate with you and to improve the WildWorks Services. Here are some examples:
Email Communications.
If you contact us via email, WildWorks may use your Personal Information to send you emails related to promotions and/or events. You can opt out of receiving promotional emails by following the instructions in the relevant correspondence. Once WildWorks has processed your opt-out request, WildWorks will not send you further promotional emails unless you later opt back in.

WildWorks does not ask you for or track any device-generated location information at any time while downloading or using WildWorks' mobile applications or services, but other information collected, such as an IP Address, may correspond to your country of origin.
Push Notifications.
On occasion, WildWorks will send you push notifications when using WildWorks' mobile applications to alert you to in-game events or provide other account information that may be important to you. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may opt-out from receiving them by turning them off at the device level through the notification settings of your mobile device.

Information Collected Automatically or Through Technology.
WildWorks may receive and store certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information whenever you interact with WildWorks. While you are able to visit the WildWorks Services and remain anonymous, WildWorks and/or WildWorks' third-party service providers may still collect Personal and Non-Personal Information through technological means. Such information may be gathered by the following methods:
Tracking.
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our partners, affiliates, and service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking user movements around the site or service, and to gather demographic information about our users in aggregate. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
Device Information.
When you download and use the WildWorks Services, WildWorks automatically collects information on the type of device you use, operating system, application version, and the persistent device identifier assigned to your device by its manufacturer ("Device ID"). You consent to WildWorks collecting this information.
Metadata.
“Metadata” is data collected and used to facilitate the WildWorks Services, monitor system usage, prevent fraud, and for other services. Some examples of metadata that WildWorks may collect and analyze include, without limitation, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, computer and connection information (such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform), the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click sequence to, through, and from the WildWorks Services, including date and time, cookie number and any products, services or features you use or interact with arising out of or in connection with your use of the WildWorks Services.
Log files.
As most websites do, WildWorks gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
Tools.
WildWorks may use software tools to measure and collect information about your use of the WildWorks Services, including, without limitation, page response times, upload and file transfer errors, interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse- overs), features use, purchase tracking and order fulfillment and methods. Sometimes, you will have a choice whether or not to provide information, but if you fail to provide certain information it could impact some features and/or functionalities of the WildWorks Services.
Information from Other Sources.
WildWorks may receive information about you from WildWorks' third-party service providers, or other sources such as purchase or redemption information, WildWorks Services usage, payment information, reporting information, page-view information, technical, fulfillment, advertising, and search information.
Mobile Analytics.
WildWorks uses mobile analytics software to better understand the functionality of its apps on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. WildWorks does not link the information stored within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the application.
Local Storage Objects.
WildWorks uses Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML 5 or Flash to store content information and preferences. Third-parties with whom WildWorks partners to provide certain features on WildWorks' site or, where applicable, to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 or Flash to collect and store information.
LSOs act like cookies in that they store information to provide you with a more customized experience, but LSOs can store complex data that cookies cannot, and LSOs are not deleted or rejected if you set your browser to delete or reject cookies. The information stored in any LSO deployed by our Sites is not used to profile or track you online. Although browser settings will not allow you to manage LSOs, you may be able to manage them in other ways. To find out more about how to manage or delete LSOs, visit

3. How Information Is Used, Shared and Disclosed.
WildWorks does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent.
WildWorks uses Personal, Non-Personal, and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the WildWorks Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, deliver advertising, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of WildWorks' business. Situations in which WildWorks shares or discloses your information also include:
Legal.
WildWorks may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal processes, and to establish/exercise WildWorks' legal rights. WildWorks may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when WildWorks believes that disclosure is necessary to protect WildWorks' rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a valid government request. WildWorks may share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of WildWorks' Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
Business Transfers.
As WildWorks continues to develop its business, WildWorks may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of WildWorks' assets are acquired or WildWorks merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that WildWorks reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such an event, WildWorks will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

4. Security
The security of your Personal Information is important to WildWorks. WildWorks follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to WildWorks, both during transmission and once it is received. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic data storage is 100% secure. Therefore, WildWorks cannot guarantee the absolute security of data it stores. Although no security system is completely secure, WildWorks and its third-party partners and vendors take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by WildWorks. For WildWorks, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information is disclosed only on a "need to know" basis and ensuring that all Personal Information collected by WildWorks is obtained via secured connections and protected and encrypted (using  at minimum Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 encryption protocol) by industrial grade security software to guard against unauthorized access.
5. Advertising
WildWorks may partner with third parties to display advertising on its websites and Apps, or to manage its advertising on other sites or services. Some of the advertising displayed on our services is contextual, meaning those that relate to the content you are viewing.  We do not collect personal information to serve contextual ads to users.
On our services that are directed to a general audience or where we have determined the age of the visitor is over the age of 13, WildWorks collects your device ID and may pass it to advertisers to enable interest-based advertising.  Interest-based advertisements may be served to you based on your browsing activities and interests on our sites and services and across other services and platforms.  For interest-based ads, third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies that collect personal information in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.
For more information about targeted advertising provided by these third parties, and how to opt out of having your information used in this way by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance, please visit: www.aboutads.info/choices or www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.  You may refer to our list of third parties in section 3 of this policy to see which of our third-party service providers offer consumer opt-out choices through the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) and/or Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) sites. WildWorks may include third-party ads in free versions of its mobile applications, in which case we may collect your Device ID and pass it to advertisers to enable certain advertising.
For users that have identified themselves as under the age of 13 or are presumed to be under 13 based on the target audience of the app (or the legal threshold age in your country of residence), we will not allow third parties to collect personal information to track or serve interest-based ads.  We do not collect personal information to serve contextual ads to users.
6. Social Media Features and Tools
The WildWorks Services may include integrated social media features and tools, such as the Facebook login or "Like" button, the YouTube "Share This" button, and interactive mini-programs that run in the WildWorks Services. These Features may collect information on your IP address, which page you are visiting on WildWorks' site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and tools are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on the WildWorks Services. Your interactions with these integrated social media features and tools are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them. These features such as Facebook login, do not apply to our child directed apps.
7. Links to Other Sites
The WildWorks Services contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by WildWorks. Please be aware that WildWorks is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the WildWorks Services.

9. Where we store information
Information we store may be stored both within and outside of the United States.

10. Special Notice Regarding Children
Some of our services are directed to an audience that includes children while others are directed to a general audience.
The age of consent regarding privacy and data may differ depending on your locale and jurisdiction.
For our general audience services, WildWorks does not knowingly collect Personal Information from persons under the age of 15. If it comes to WildWorks' attention that Personal Information has been collected from a person under the age of 15, WildWorks will delete this information as quickly as possible.
