Animash Privacy Policy
Version 6
Updated: March 20th, 2025
​
This "Privacy Policy" section informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of Animash.
​
Data and tracking by Abstract Software Inc
Abstract Software Inc does not directly collect any data or track the user within the Animash app.
​
Data and tracking by Third-Party Ad Providers (UnityAds, AppLovin, AdMob, etc.)
Animash uses multiple ad networks to serve advertisements, including (but not limited to) UnityAds, AppLovin, AdMob, and others. These third-party companies may collect certain information about you to serve personalized ads. This can include identifiers such as your device ID or your advertisement-engagement history.
​
We use Google’s UMP (User Messaging Platform) to present consent forms for users in regions with special data-protection laws (such as GDPR, certain U.S. states, etc.). These forms allow you to set or update your preferences regarding personalized advertising. Because policies and data-collection practices of these third-party ad providers may change over time, please consult their respective resources and privacy policies for the most up-to-date information. If you wish to have these networks stop tracking your data, or if you want them to delete information they have collected about you, please contact the respective provider directly. You can also contact Abstract Software Inc, and we will make reasonable efforts to contact these providers on your behalf.
​
If the User is a Minor/Child:
- If you (or your child) self-identify as a minor (for example, under 13 in certain regions), Animash will make every effort to disable personalized ads and tracking by these third-party providers, showing only non-behavioral, non-tracking advertisements. Adult users or those over the applicable age threshold may continue to receive personalized ads, based on their consent preferences.
​
Specific details about data collection and usage can be found on the respective store pages (Google Play, Apple App Store), as well as in the following privacy policies:

​
Coarse Geolocation Data
When you first launch the app, Animash determines your coarse geolocation data via your IP address. This is necessary to identify whether you are in a region with special privacy laws (such as GDPR, etc.) so that we can adjust our data collection and consent procedures accordingly.
​
Changes to this Privacy Policy
This privacy policy is effective as of the date of creation, and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

Animash Terms & Conditions
Version 6
Updated: March 20th, 2025
​
Agreement to Terms & Conditions
To access and use the Animash application, users must agree to our current Terms & Conditions ("T&C"). Upon the introduction of an updated version of these terms, a notification will promptly appear when launching the Animash app. It’s essential to note that users will be unable to continue using the application without accepting these updated T&C. By accepting our T&C, users acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agree to comply with these terms. Non-acceptance or violation of these terms may result in the suspension or termination of access to the Animash application. Abstract Software Inc. reserves the right to amend these terms at any time, and it is the responsibility of the user to review and accept these changes to maintain access to the application.
​
If the User is a Minor/Child:
- If you identify yourself as under the applicable age threshold (e.g., under 13), a parent or guardian must review and accept these Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy on your behalf.
- By pressing “Continue” or otherwise indicating acceptance for a child user, the parent or guardian affirms that they are legally authorized to act on the child’s behalf.
​
Online Connectivity Requirement
Animash is an online-only game that requires an active internet connection for most gameplay activities. As of game version 140, players may view their saved creations without an active connection to the Animash servers. However, the creation of new creatures and other interactive features still require a live server connection. While we strive to ensure continuous server availability, access to Animash’s servers is not guaranteed. Interruptions may occur due to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to VPNs, firewalls, and ISP restrictions. Additionally, server crashes, maintenance, or external actions like the removal of our app from digital stores could also hinder access. By accepting these terms, users acknowledge and consent to these stipulations, recognizing that both user-side and developer-side issues can affect their ability to connect to and interact with Animash. This understanding includes periods where server access may be inconsistent or unavailable, impacting the overall gameplay experience.
​
"Remove Ads" Subscriptions
In Animash, users can opt for a 'Remove Ads' subscription to enjoy an ad-free experience when the game is accessible. This subscription is available in three durations: 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year, and will automatically renew unless cancelled. While subscribing will disable ads within Animash, it does not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted access to the game. Users are not paying for guaranteed access, but rather for an enhanced experience during periods of accessibility. Access to Animash may be interrupted or become completely inaccessible due to several factors beyond the control of Abstract Software Inc. These factors include but are not limited to: dependencies on external services or programs that, if discontinued or impaired, could render Animash inaccessible; removal of Animash from digital distribution platforms such as Google Play or the App Store by Google or Apple; or direct or indirect blocking of the game in certain countries or regions. Given the complex infrastructure required to maintain the game, and the potentially unreliable nature of access, Abstract Software Inc. is not obligated to issue refunds for interruptions or outages that occur. While Abstract Software Inc. will endeavor to keep the game accessible during active subscription periods, continuous access cannot be guaranteed. By agreeing to these terms, users acknowledge and accept these conditions, understanding the nature of digital service availability and the limitations herein described. Despite our efforts to ensure an active “Remove Ads” subscription disables all in-game ads, unforeseen code or initialization errors may sometimes cause ads to temporarily reappear.
​
"Remove Ads Forever" One-Time Purchase
Animash offers an optional, one-time payment to remove all in-game ads. Once purchased, ads will not appear while Animash remains live and operational. You acknowledge that Animash may be shut down or discontinued in the future due to factors such as server costs or lack of profitability. In such an event, your “Remove Ads Forever” purchase will no longer serve its purpose. Before finalizing the “Remove Ads Forever” purchase, a popup is displayed in the game to inform you that this feature will no longer have any effect if Animash is discontinued. While purchasing "Remove Ads Forever" will disable ads within Animash, it does not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted access to the game. Users are not paying for guaranteed access, but rather for an enhanced experience during periods of accessibility. Access to Animash may be interrupted or become completely inaccessible due to several factors beyond the control of Abstract Software Inc. These factors include but are not limited to dependencies on external services or programs that, if discontinued or impaired, could render Animash inaccessible, removal of Animash from digital distribution platforms such as Google Play or the App Store by Google or Apple, or direct or indirect blocking of the game in certain countries or regions. Given the complex infrastructure required to maintain the game, and the potentially unreliable nature of access, Abstract Software Inc. is not obligated to issue refunds for interruptions or outages that occur. While Abstract Software Inc. will endeavor to keep the game accessible for as long as it remains commercially viable, continuous or uninterrupted access cannot be guaranteed. By agreeing to these terms, users acknowledge and accept these conditions, understanding the nature of digital service availability and the limitations herein described. Although “Remove Ads Forever” is intended to remove all ads on an ongoing basis, technical anomalies or faults in the in-app purchase system may occasionally result in ads temporarily appearing.
​
Reward Tokens
Reward Tokens can be bought to unlock a limited set of animals in the "Rewards" screen. They do not unlock every animal in Animash. As of January 2025, the available unlocks are Dragon, Unicorn, Plasma, and Black Hole. Additional animals may become available in future updates, but no specific additions are guaranteed. Reward Tokens are treated as consumable in-app purchases. Consequently, they may not transfer between devices if you change or upgrade your phone, switch operating systems, or reinstall the app. By purchasing Reward Tokens, you acknowledge and accept that these items may not be recoverable under such circumstances. Since Reward Tokens are a digital product, all sales are generally final unless otherwise required by applicable law or platform rules. Animash may modify or remove content that can be unlocked with Reward Tokens. By purchasing, you acknowledge these features may evolve, and that there is no guarantee of new or continued availability of any specific animal or feature.
​
Shuffle Tokens
Shuffle Tokens are an optional in-app purchase in Animash that allow users to randomly iterate through a limited set of animal combinations. Animash contains a finite number of animal sets. Shuffle Tokens enable you to explore these combinations randomly, but there is no guarantee of discovering new or unique animals after the available sets have been exhausted. Before completing the purchase of Shuffle Tokens, a notification will appear in the app to inform you that animal sets are limited. By proceeding with the purchase, you agree that you have reviewed and understood this disclaimer. Shuffle Tokens do not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted access to Animash. Access may be affected by server issues, platform restrictions, or the potential discontinuation of the app. Abstract Software Inc. reserves the right to modify, add, or remove animal sets or features related to Shuffle Tokens at any time. Purchased Shuffle Tokens may be affected by these changes. Shuffle Tokens are considered digital consumables, and all sales are final unless otherwise required by applicable law or platform rules. By purchasing or using Shuffle Tokens, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these terms.
​
Unlimited Shuffle Tokens
Unlimited Shuffle Tokens are an optional one-time purchase in Animash that allow users to shuffle animal sets indefinitely without consuming individual tokens. While Unlimited Shuffle Tokens allow unlimited shuffling, Animash contains a finite number of animal sets. This feature provides unlimited shuffles, not an unlimited pool of unique animals. Before completing the purchase of Unlimited Shuffle Tokens, a notification will appear in the app to clarify that the feature is subject to the limited nature of Animash’s animal sets and the app’s continued availability. The Unlimited Shuffle Tokens feature, like other one-time purchases, will no longer function if Animash is discontinued. Unlimited Shuffle Tokens do not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted access to Animash. Access may be affected by server issues, platform restrictions, or the potential discontinuation of the app. Abstract Software Inc. reserves the right to modify, add, or remove features associated with Unlimited Shuffle Tokens at any time. Unlimited Shuffle Tokens are treated as digital purchases, and all sales are final unless otherwise required by applicable law or platform rules. By purchasing Unlimited Shuffle Tokens, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these terms.
​
Age Restrictions
When the app is first launched, the player is asked whether or not they are over a certain age (e.g., "Are you at least 13 or older?"). In certain regions, this question may involve a higher minimum age (for example, 16 or 18). Users must answer honestly to this question, as other functionality in the app relies on it (e.g., restricted access to the Community). If you self-identify as a minor (under the applicable age threshold), the app will restrict certain features (e.g., community content) and only show non-personalized, non-tracking ads. A parent or guardian must press 'Continue' to confirm acceptance of the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy on the child’s behalf if the child wishes to continue using Animash.
​
Inappropriate Ads and Content Filtering
We use various methods—such as content category filters and advertiser blocking—to prevent inappropriate ads from being shown in Animash. However, automated filtering systems are not foolproof, and occasional instances of potentially offensive or inappropriate ads may still appear. These advertisements are served by third-party providers, and their content is beyond our direct control. By using Animash, you understand and accept that the presence of such ads is a risk associated with any ad-supported service. When inappropriate ads are detected or reported, they are typically flagged and removed promptly by our ad providers. If you encounter any ads that you believe to be inappropriate, please contact us immediately. We will work diligently with our ad providers to resolve the issue as swiftly as possible. However, neither Animash nor Abstract Software Inc. accepts liability for any damages, harm, or offense arising from the display of third-party ads, and we do not guarantee the complete absence of potentially inappropriate content.
​
Community
Within Animash, there is a “Community” button that leads to an external subreddit created for the game. Users who have self-reported as being under the applicable age of consent in their region are restricted from accessing this subreddit due to the possibility of inappropriate or harmful content being posted by malicious users. While moderators strive to remove such content, it may be visible to some users for a limited time. By self-reporting your age accurately, you acknowledge and agree to these access limitations if you fall below the required age threshold.
​
Refund Policy
In the event that you, as an Android user, experience any issue with your purchases, we recommend reaching out to Google's customer support for possible resolution including potential refunds. Similarly, if you are an iOS user experiencing similar issues, we advise you to seek assistance from Apple's customer service. Please note, Abstract Software Inc. cannot assure the outcome of these refund requests as they are subjected to the respective refund policies of Google and Apple. By agreeing to these T&C, users acknowledge and accept this aspect of the game's operational framework.
​
Identifying Accepted Terms & Conditions Date
To confirm the date that you acknowledged and accepted the Terms & Conditions, please navigate to the main menu and click on the Settings icon, typically depicted as a gear button. Look for an entry denoted as "T&C" or a similar notation, typically found in the top-left section of your screen. This entry indicates the date that you accepted the Terms & Conditions. By continuing to use our services, you affirm your understanding and agreement to this process. If you would like a copy of a previous version of the Terms & Conditions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

User Risk

Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here
, current as of the date listed at the top of that page.
If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, please see the
“Manage Your Privacy Choices”
section below. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or Switzerland, you may also see the
“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.
Manage Your Privacy Choices:
To limit collection of information from mobile devices, please visit your device’s settings to set the “Limit Ad Track” or other similar features on your device. Additionally, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising within ads served by AppLovin. For detailed instructions, see
How AppLovin Shows You Ads
. You can also make choices about data collection for certain companies by visiting an industry consumer choice platform such as the NAI (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
) or DAA (
https://optout.aboutads.info/
).  You may still receive ads after limiting processing of information for interest-based advertising, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.
To see or manage the data collected by AppLovin from your device, you may download the AppLovin Privacy Management Application from the Apple or Google Play Stores:
By navigating through the tabs in the AppLovin Privacy Management Application, you can erase the personal information that AppLovin may have collected about you or request a copy of that personal information.
Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from, or serve advertisements to, children as defined and required by applicable laws. If you believe we have served an advertisement to a child or might have any personal information from or about a child, or if you believe a mobile application in which an AppLovin-served advertisement appeared may be designed for, directed to, or pass personal information knowingly from, children in violation of our policies, please contact us via email at
dataprotection@applovin.com
.

Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals
If you are located in the European Union, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, the following additional provisions apply to you.
Data Privacy Framework
AppLovin complies with the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, AppLovin commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact AppLovin at
dataprotection@applovin.com
. AppLovin refers unresolved complaints to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
for more information or to file a complaint.  These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you.
For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website.
Lawful Basis for Processing
On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide services to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning our products and services.
On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers, where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
If the processing of your personal data is necessary, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you if there is no other lawful basis for such processing. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of personal data should be sent to us as specified in the “Contact” section below. Certain personal data, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, is considered “Sensitive Information”. AppLovin does not collect or seek to elicit “Sensitive Information”.
For questions about data processing, please contact our Data Protection Officer. Visit the “Contact” section below for contact information.

To request access to the personal data we hold about you;
To request that we rectify or erase your personal data;
To request that we restrict or block the processing of your personal data;
Under certain circumstances, to receive personal data about you that we store and transmit to another without hindrance from us, including requesting that we provide your personal data directly to another, i.e., a right to data portability; and
Where we previously obtained your consent, to withdraw consent to processing your personal data.
To exercise these rights, please contact us at the email address set forth in the
“Contact Us”
section below.  Our Data Protection Officer can also be reached at this email address.  Please be aware that we may be unable to afford these rights to you under certain circumstances, such as if we are legally prevented from doing so.
In certain circumstances, you may appoint an authorized agent to exercise any rights that you may have on your behalf.  If you choose to exercise any rights through an authorized agent, you will need to verify your identity directly with us before we can process any requests.  In addition, we will need written documentation demonstrating the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.
Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us. To do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.

Google Play's data disclosure requirements
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In May 2021, Google Play
announced the new Data safety
section
,
which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing,
and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in
regards to your usage of the Google Mobile Ads SDK. On this page, you can find
information on whether and how our SDK handles end-user data, including any
applicable settings or configurations you can control as the app developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app
developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google
Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection,
sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest version

(version
24.1.0
) of the
Google Mobile Ads SDK.
If you are using a prior version of the Google Mobile Ads SDK, consider
updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate.
The Google Mobile Ads SDK will continue to be updated over time. This page
reflects these changes, so make sure to check back and update your disclosures
as necessary.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's
guide about data
types
to help you
determine which
data
types
and
purposes
best describe the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also
account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
Data collected and shared automatically
The Google Mobile Ads SDK collects and shares the following data types
automatically
for

advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes.
Data
By default, the Google Mobile Ads SDK...
IP address
Collects device's IP address, which may be used to estimate the general
    location of a device.
User product interactions
Collects user product interactions and interaction information, including
    app launch, taps, and video views.
Diagnostic information
Collects information related to the performance of your app and the SDK,
    including
     
     crash logs,
     
     app launch time, hang rate, and energy usage.
Device and Account identifiers
Collects
Android
    advertising (ad) ID
,
app set ID
,
    and, if applicable, other identifiers related to signed-in accounts on the
    device.
All of the user data collected by Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in
transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
Data handling
Android ad ID collection is optional. The ad ID can be reset or deleted by users
using ad ID controls in the Android settings menu. As the app developer, you can
prevent the collection of ad IDs by
updating the app's manifest
file
.
Certain other features in the Google Mobile Ads SDK, such as the
Limited Ads
feature, may also disable transmission of the ad ID and other data.
Data collected and shared depending on your usage
If you are using any optional product features that involve additional data
(such as advance reporting) or participating in any tests of new product
features that involve additional data, be sure to check if those features or
tests require additional data disclosures.

Apple App Store's data disclosure requirements
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Apple requires that developers publishing apps on the App Store disclose
certain information
regarding their apps' data use. Apple has
announced
that these disclosures will
be required for new apps and app updates starting December 8, 2020. This guide
explains the Google Mobile Ads SDK's data collection practices as of
7.68.0, to make it easier for AdMob
developers to answer the questions in App Store Connect.
To improve the performance of AdMob, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect
certain information from apps, including:
IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and
improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and
analytics purposes.
User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or
energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the
effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features.
Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with
other entities that display ads.
A Device ID, such as the device's advertising identifier or other app- or
developer-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of
third-party advertising and analytics.
Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to
power analytics and advertising features.
Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction
information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising
performance.
If you are using any optional product features that involve additional data
(such as advance reporting) or participating in any tests of new product
features that involve additional data, be sure to check if those features or
tests require additional data disclosures.
If you are using a prior version of the Google Mobile Ads SDK, consider
updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate.
The Google Mobile Ads SDK will continue to be updated over time. This
article will reflect these changes, so make sure to check back and update your
disclosures as necessary.
Apple's privacy manifest files
Google Mobile Ads SDK version 11.2.0 and higher supports
privacy manifest declarations. You are responsible for checking the privacy
manifest and ensuring that your application's data disclosures are up to date.
Refer to
Apple documentation
for details on interpreting a privacy report and their
enforcement update
for app submission requirements.
Xcode 16 validation warnings
When submitting apps built with Xcode 16 to the App Store, you might encounter
Upload Symbols Failed
warnings related to the Google Mobile Ads and User
Messaging Platform SDKs. You can dismiss these warnings because these SDKs are
static frameworks, which don't need a separate dSYM file for debugging.

Apple privacy survey for Unity Ads
#
