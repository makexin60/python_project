Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the MOBOREADER Services, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. Third parties that support the MOBOREADER Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate MOBOREADER Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. MOBOREADER does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
