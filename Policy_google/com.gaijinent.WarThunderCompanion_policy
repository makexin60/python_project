[Added on June 25, 2024]: For the avoidance of doubt, this includes that no mobile information will be shared/sold to third parties for their own marketing reasons.
However, we do share data in very limited cases with our partners, service providers, and affiliates, including those located outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
With whom do we share data?
Gaming platforms
. We share your data with our business partners involved in Games distribution to enable access to our Services from those platforms and to enable user support and all the features related to our Services for those users who are playing our Games through gaming platforms. Some of these partners are located outside the EEA. For example, these are Microsoft operating Xbox, Nintendo with Nintendo Switch, and Sony operating PlayStation.
Payment services providers
. We are engaging authorized payment services providers to process payments for our Services. Depending on your region, your data might be shared with those payment service providers who are licensed and operate in the respective region and country.
Anti-cheat systems
. We may monitor your activities while using the Services and analyze the devices and software you are using to ensure your following
Gaijin Terms of Services
and
EULA
, including prevention of cheating and fraud in our Games, and monitoring toxicity.
Advertising partners
. From time to time, we engage advertising partners to assist us with their tracking and analytical tools. For example, we may share anonymized information on your device, location and purchases, and use of the Services. In some cases, their third-party partners may enhance these data with the information they already have, including the data about you.
Operating partners
. We are engaging server hosting providers to store the data necessary to provide our Services online.
Service providers
. We may share data with our third-party services providers, for example, software developers or administrative services providers.
Affiliates
. We may share personal data with companies within the Gaijin group and affiliated entities.
Auditors
. When an audit or financial reporting obligation is imposed on us by applicable law, we share data with third parties to comply with these obligations. We are carefully assessing each case and sharing the narrowest scope of data possible.
Governmental bodies
. We share data with governmental bodies, directly or through our partners, when it is prescribed by applicable law, legally requested by authorized bodies, or otherwise necessary to protect the rights or interests of our users or our own. We carefully assess each case and share the narrowest possible data.
Gaijin users
. Other users of our Services may see some of your data when some Services features allow so. For example, your nickname, avatar (profile photo), and the data of your linked accounts (including Steam, PSN, and Apple Game Center accounts) are visible to other players. They can also see any content you post publicly within our Services and social networks (public messages on forums, attached files, etc.), or some of your game results (data of in-game ratings or leaderboards) and achievements.
Additionally, we may ask for your specific consent to share your personal data with other third parties. In this case, we will specify those third parties, the scope of data to be shared, purposes, and further details on relevant data processing.
Transferring your data abroad
We operate all over the world, and therefore we may transfer your data to third parties in different countries, including those which are located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We make all our efforts, including those imposed on us by applicable law, to ensure an adequate level of personal data protection in each case. Some countries to which we transfer your data may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
However, in such cases, we are taking reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information provide sufficient protection of your data. In particular, Gaijin undertakes appropriate physical, technical, and administrative security measures to ensure your data is adequately protected.
HOW LONG DO WE PROCESS YOUR DATA
We process your data for as long as our processing purposes, the legal retention periods, and our legitimate interests require it, or storage is a technical necessity.
We keep your personal data for as long as it is required considering our processing purposes (including while your Gaijin Account is active according to the Terms and Conditions) and our legitimate interests, regulatory or technical requirements regarding data storage. If there are no contrary legal or contractual obligations, we will delete or anonymize your data once the storage or processing period has expired.
Please consider that we have the right to continue to retain some of your user data even after complying with your request to delete such data in the following cases:
we have the lawful basis to further processing your data other than consent from you (for instance, we may be required to do so to comply with applicable laws, such as tax or accounting regulations, know-your-customer, anti-money laundering, or other legal requirements and obligations);
your user data has been anonymized in a way it cannot be used to identify you and therefore is no longer your personal identifiable data.
CHILDREN’S DATA
We acknowledge the importance of protecting children’s data and confirm our special duty to act accordingly. Thus, we take additional steps to verify the user’s age and limit access to our Services for those who have not reached the appropriate age limit.
We do not intentionally collect, store or otherwise process any personal data of users under the age of 16 unless we are furnished with consent from their parent, guardian, or another holder of parental responsibility.
If you are a parent, guardian, or another holder of parental responsibility, and you want to withdraw your previously given consent, or you find out that your child has provided us with their personal data without your consent, or you believe that we have unintentionally collected your child’s data and processed such data in violation of applicable law, please send us a request for the removal of such data by contacting
Gaijin Support
. To proceed with such a request, we may ask you to provide us with conclusive evidence that:
the child has not yet reached 16 or the minimum age of consent in accordance with their applicable legislation, and
you are the holder of parental responsibility for such a child.
If it comes that we have unintentionally collected personal data of a child under 16 (or a child who has not reached the age of consent in accordance with applicable law) without the consent of that child’s holder of parental responsibility, we will take all reasonable steps to erase this information as soon as possible, unless we are legally obliged to keep these data.
We strongly encourage parents, legal guardians, or other holders of parental responsibility to instruct their children never to disclose their real names, addresses, phone numbers, financial information, or any other sensitive data about themselves when using our services, in-game chats, on the websites (forums, commentaries, etc.) and otherwise on the Internet.
HOW DO WE SECURE DATA
We are constantly working on the creation, improvement, and further implementation of both administrative and technical measures for securing your data. These measures are aimed at protecting your data from any unauthorized actions which can be carried out by third parties or occur incidentally, such as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, or other malicious use of your data, as well as incidental loss or corruption of such data. We undertake all reasonable steps and measures which are necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please consider that we maintain some of our servers where we store information containing your data outside the EEA.
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING AND ONLINE TRACKING
Gaijin itself does not use your data for profiling or other means of automated decision-making that could affect you, including your access to the services or other rights under the Terms and Conditions.
At the same time, some of our partners, as described in Section 4 (How We Share Data), may apply automated decision-making while processing the data we share with them (for example, for anti-cheat and unfair play prevention purposes).
We use various techniques on our website that allow us, and third parties engaged by us, to recognize you during your use of our website and possibly to track you through several visits. This data is essentially used to enhance and personalize your experience with our websites. This works in such a way that our systems or systems of our partners recognize you (by sending so-called “cookies” to your browser for further identification) when you are entering any Gaijin website, and tailor the website settings and content to your preferences and previous experience.

Gaijin Support
after signing in to your Gaijin Account. We ask you to sign in with your Gaijin Account to ensure that it is you and to limit cases where third parties have access to your personal data or in any way affect processing your personal data and exercising your data subject rights.
It might happen that you have lost access to your Gaijin Account. In this case, you are still welcome to exercise your rights.

Data erasure
If you decided to erase the data that we have on you, we would delete your data where it is possible considering other users and our obligations to store data under applicable law.
Please note that data erasure would lead to complete irrevocable deletion of your Gaijin Account. This means that, after the deletion, you will be unable to restore your game progress, acquired in-game assets, and currencies.
We will first suspend an account while eliciting all the personal data that we have on you. This means that you will not have access to our Services. As a rule, we delete personal data in 30 days. However, if we need some more time to consider technical issues and the complexity of the request, we will anyway complete the erasure request within 2 months.
If you decide to restore the account after submitting your data erasure request, you may send us a request through
Gaijin Support
within 30 days after you suspended your account. We will restore your Gaijin Account and let you know if the deletion process still needs to be completed. Otherwise, we will permanently delete your account and your personal data after the expiration of this suspension period.
HOW TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT
You can withdraw your consent to process your data under this Privacy Policy at any time by initiating the deletion of your Gaijin Account through your account settings and following the instructions provided by Gaijin after you send such a deletion request.
If you wish to withdraw your consent in respect of a particular processing purpose, please contact us at
Gaijin Support Portal
. However, we reserve the right to cease providing you the services if your withdrawal is not consistent with providing services in the manner prescribed by the Terms and Conditions. Please note that such withdrawal does not impact the validity of the consent before withdrawal, and we reserve the right to process your data on another lawful basis if permitted by applicable law.
Please also note that uninstalling our game (or any application related to our services) from your device does not automatically result in consent withdrawal or deleting your personal data from our servers.
