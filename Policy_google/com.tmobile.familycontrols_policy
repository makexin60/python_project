Analytics and Reporting.

T-Mobile
device aggregated as part of our Analytics and Reporting program by going to our
Privacy Dashboard
.
Changes.
Most of our websites allow you to change your account profile. For changes that can’t be made through your account profile, you can request that we correct your personal data.
Deletion.
You may request that we delete your personal data. Note that in many situations we must keep some of your personal data for our business purposes, like providing service to you, detecting security problems, or complying with our legal obligations.
Marketing emails or texts.
You can adjust your marketing communication preferences in our
Privacy Dashboard
. To learn more, read the
Your marketing preferences
article.
Do not sell or share.
You may opt out of having your data sold or shared by us, which includes having it used for targeted advertising or for third parties to use for direct marketing, by going to our
Privacy Dashboard
or using the “Do Not Share or Sell My Personal Information” link on our websites or apps. If you’ve opted in to our Personalized Ads & Offers program, you may also need to withdraw your consent via the Privacy Dashboard to be removed from that program. We recognize the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal broadcast from certain web browsers as an opt-out request, but we don’t recognize the “do not track” signal because there isn’t a universal standard for how to apply it. Read our
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
article for more information.
Profiling and automated decisions.
You can tell us not to use your personal data for certain kinds of “profiling” that we might do in the future by visiting our
Privacy Dashboard
to opt out. “Profiling” is a specific type of activity under certain privacy laws and generally refers to the automated processing of personal data to evaluate, analyze, or predict certain personal aspects about your performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements. You can opt out of having profiling used for future decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects on you.
These choices may not apply in every circumstance. In some cases, we might limit or deny your request because the law allows or requires us to do so. We might also deny your request if we can’t verify who you are. We won’t discriminate against you for making one of these choices.
To make an access, change, or deletion request please
submit a personal data request
. We’re required to verify your identity before we can give you access to, change, or delete your personal data. So, you’ll need to provide some data for us to do the verification. This includes your email address and phone number, or your
T-Mobile
ID and password. If you don’t have a
T-Mobile
ID, you may need to provide your U.S. driver’s license, state ID, or passport. We may also need a photo of your face so we can ensure the photo ID belongs to you. In some cases, you may designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf.
If you disagree with our denial of a request, you may be entitled to submit an appeal. If that’s the case, we’ll include instructions for how to submit your appeal in our response.
We won’t use, disclose, sell, or permit access to Maine broadband “customer personal information” unless you give us permission, or it’s allowed by Maine law. If you’re a Maine customer, you have rights you can exercise in our
Privacy Dashboard

Your choices
We offer you certain choices related to your personal data:
Access.
You may request access to your personal data or confirmation that we have data about you. We will provide access to your data in a portable and machine-readable format. For multi-line accounts, the individual in charge of your account that submits an access request will receive account-level data for all lines on the account (e.g., billing and rate plan information). Personal data associated with a particular phone number on the account will not be shared with them.

Analytics and Reporting.
You may opt out of having the data from your
T-Mobile
device aggregated as part of our Analytics and Reporting program by going to our
Privacy Dashboard
.
Changes.
Most of our websites allow you to change your account profile. For changes that can’t be made through your account profile, you can request that we correct your personal data.
Deletion.
You may request that we delete your personal data. Note that in many situations we must keep some of your personal data for our business purposes, like providing service to you, detecting security problems, or complying with our legal obligations.
Marketing emails or texts.
You can adjust your marketing communication preferences in our
Privacy Dashboard
. To learn more, read the
Your marketing preferences
article.
Do not sell or share.
You may opt out of having your data sold or shared by us, which includes having it used for targeted advertising or for third parties to use for direct marketing, by going to our
Privacy Dashboard
or using the “Do Not Share or Sell My Personal Information” link on our websites or apps. If you’ve opted in to our Personalized Ads & Offers program, you may also need to withdraw your consent via the Privacy Dashboard to be removed from that program. We recognize the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal broadcast from certain web browsers as an opt-out request, but we don’t recognize the “do not track” signal because there isn’t a universal standard for how to apply it. Read our
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
article for more information.
Profiling and automated decisions.
You can tell us not to use your personal data for certain kinds of “profiling” that we might do in the future by visiting our
Privacy Dashboard
to opt out. “Profiling” is a specific type of activity under certain privacy laws and generally refers to the automated processing of personal data to evaluate, analyze, or predict certain personal aspects about your performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements. You can opt out of having profiling used for future decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects on you.
These choices may not apply in every circumstance. In some cases, we might limit or deny your request because the law allows or requires us to do so. We might also deny your request if we can’t verify who you are. We won’t discriminate against you for making one of these choices.
To make an access, change, or deletion request please
submit a personal data request
. We’re required to verify your identity before we can give you access to, change, or delete your personal data. So, you’ll need to provide some data for us to do the verification. This includes your email address and phone number, or your
T-Mobile
ID and password. If you don’t have a
T-Mobile
ID, you may need to provide your U.S. driver’s license, state ID, or passport. We may also need a photo of your face so we can ensure the photo ID belongs to you. In some cases, you may designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf.
If you disagree with our denial of a request, you may be entitled to submit an appeal. If that’s the case, we’ll include instructions for how to submit your appeal in our response.
We won’t use, disclose, sell, or permit access to Maine broadband “customer personal information” unless you give us permission, or it’s allowed by Maine law. If you’re a Maine customer, you have rights you can exercise in our
Privacy Dashboard
.
Under California’s Shine the Light law, California customers may request information about whether a business has disclosed personal data (as defined in that law) to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We don’t do that without your permission.

Browser or platform controls
Global Privacy Control
Some browsers and browser extensions support the “Global Privacy Control” (GPC) or similar controls that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, as specified by applicable law.

Overview
T‑Mobile cares about the security of your personal information and wants to protect you and us against fraud. Where permitted by law, T‑Mobile and our contractors (“we”, “us”) use ID scanning and facial recognition technology to verify your identity and safeguard personal information as part of our security and fraud prevention efforts. This notice describes our collection and use of biometric data for these security and fraud prevention purposes.
When we refer to “biometric data,” we mean information about your physical or biological characteristics (some states call these “biometric identifiers”) that identify you. Information like eye, hand, or face scans; fingerprints; and voiceprints may be considered biometric data if
they are being used to identify you. The definitions of biometric data vary under different states’ laws. For example, some states’ biometric laws don’t apply to driver’s license photos. Photos of you are not biometric data, but biometric data can be made from processing the photo.
How we use your biometric data
When we scan your ID or take your photo, we may use the image to create a “biometric identifier.” We also collect other information

Children’s Privacy
PRIVACY NOTICE
Updated:
March 12, 2024
Overview
We know it’s important to treat data that you tell us is from children under 18, and data from products and services we design for children under 18, very carefully. This Children’s Privacy Notice (“notice”) explains what we do (and don’t do) when it comes to children’s data.
Just looking for our general privacy notice? Read the
T-Mobile
Privacy Notice
.
What this notice covers
This notice applies to several products and services, including:
Kids’ privacy setting—Kids’ Line
T-Mobile
is currently testing the ability for parents and guardians to designate a line as a “Kids’ Line.” This feature enables parents to tell us that a line on their account is used by a child under the age of 18.
Project 10Million
Project 10Million provides families that qualify with a free
Wi-Fi
hotspot and 100GB of free data.
SyncUP KIDS Watch
The SyncUP KIDS Watch connects families with their children by enabling talk and text for approved contacts, real-time location tracking, and virtual boundary alerts.
FamilyMode and Safe & Found
FamilyMode and Safe & Found are two solutions that let parents manage and control their kids’ online activities and screen time across the family’s compatible devices.
This notice doesn’t apply to data collected by third party apps and websites, and we encourage parents to review the terms and policies of apps and websites before allowing children to use them. For more information, read the
Family Controls and privacy
article.
Children’s data we collect
We don’t knowingly collect data from or about children under 18 without the permission of their parent or guardian. When we do collect that data, we might do it
directly
, like when you sign up for a service. We might also collect it
automatically
if your child uses the products or services we offer.
Different products and services collect different kinds of data. The categories of children’s data that each product or service collected in the last twelve months are listed below.
Kids’ privacy setting—Kids’ lines
T-Mobile
is currently testing the ability for parents and guardians can designate a line as a “Kids’ Line.” This feature enables parents to tell us that a line on their account is used by a child under the age of 18. We won’t use data from designated Kids’ Lines for advertising, and we’ll opt the line out of receiving marketing communications from
T-Mobile
.
This feature is currently only available to customers with
T-Mobile
-branded rate plans, but we’re working hard to expand access to all customers soon. In the meantime, customers can opt out of the use of their data for advertising at any time through their account settings.
We collect the following data from Kids‘ Lines:
Geolocation Data
We collect data that tells us the location of your child’s mobile device.
Unique Identifiers
We collect device and network identifiers—basically, ways for us to tell which mobile device on our network is your child’s.
Age
We collect your child’s birth month and year so that we can tell when your child turns 18 and can change the line back to a regular line.
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)
CPNI is generated by your child’s use of our wireless voice communications services. For more information, read the
Phone privacy
article.
Information from your child’s use of our products, services, and network (and other carriers’ networks when roaming domestically or internationally)
This includes usage of connecting carriers and Internet service providers, IP address, text messages, and data use history, content interactions (for example, how long you use an app), language settings, and other network and device analytics and
Wi-Fi
connection and usage data.
Device and service performance and diagnostic information
This includes reports from your child’s device about signal strength, speeds, app and service performance, dropped calls, call and data failures, geolocation information, and device data.
Audio information
This includes voice commands your child provides to our apps (for example, for accessibility or hands-free use).
Read the
T-Mobile
Privacy Notice
to learn more about how we collect, use, and share data from regular lines.
Project 10Million
Project 10Million provides families that qualify with a free
Wi-Fi
hotspot and 100GB of free data.
We collect the following data as part of Project 10Million:
Child’s first and last name
Child’s student ID
We collect this to check whether your child is eligible.
Data usage
This tells us the amount of data the hotspot uses, and IP addresses associated with websites visited.
Unique identifiers
We collect device and network identifiers—basically, ways for us to tell which hotspot on our network is your child’s.
SyncUP KIDS Watch
The SyncUP KIDS Watch connects families with their children by enabling talk and text for approved contacts, real-time location tracking, and virtual boundary alerts. We collect the following data via the SyncUP KIDS watch:
Geolocation data
This tells us the location of your child’s SyncUP KIDS Watch.
Unique identifiers
These tell us which SyncUP KIDS Watch on our network is your child’s.
Call and text usage information
This includes Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) your child generates when they use our wireless voice service. For more information, read the
Phone privacy
article.
Photo, video, audio, and text messages
We collect these to transmit them to the recipient and store them on the watch. We don’t store copies of the messages or copies of photos, videos, and audio clips generated by the watch anywhere else.
Child interactions with device
This includes, for example, if the watch is turned on or off, if it enters or leaves airplane mode, watch battery charge level, child step counts, and other watch activity information. We collect these to provide notifications to you in the app about both your child’s activities and their watch status.
Information from your child’s use of our product, services, and network (and other carriers’ networks when roaming domestically or internationally)
Like usage of connecting carriers and Internet service providers, the IP address, text messages, and data use history, content interactions, language settings, and other network and device analytics and usage data.
Device and service performance and diagnostic information
This includes reports from your child’s device about signal strength, speeds, device, app and service performance, dropped calls, call and data failures, geolocation information, and device data.
Back-up information
Including, for example, contacts set by you in the app. We collect this so that certain information can be restored to a new watch pairing.
Name and age
We also collect your child’s name and age directly from you when you set up the watch to help personalize the product. Age is optional but does allow us to enable additional features.
Please note, you can revoke your consent at any time and delete your child’s data by removing your child’s profile.
FamilyMode and Safe & Found
FamilyMode and Safe & Found are two solutions that let parents manage and control their kids’ online activities and screen time across the family’s compatible devices.
T-Mobile
and its vendor, Smith Micro, collect the following data via FamilyMode and Safe & Found:
Geolocation data
This tells us the location of your child’s device. This information is stored for 7 days.
Profile name and photo
These are used to customize the service.
Internet usage and history
This is used to provide content filtering services and provide parents with information about their child’s Internet usage. This information is stored for 8 days.
Time zone
This is used to provide the service.
Please note, you can revoke your consent at any time and delete your child’s data by either deleting your child’s profile or cancelling your FamilyMode or your Safe & Found subscription.
How we use children’s data
The main reason we collect children’s data is to provide the product or service that collected the data. But we may also use children’s data to do things like:
Create and administer accounts, complete transactions, payments, billing, and requests related to our products and services and third-party products and services charged to your accounts.
Check eligibility for a particular product or service.
Help stop fraudulent, malicious, deceptive, abusive, or unlawful activities.
Fix errors and ensure the quality, security, and safety of our products and services and network.
Guide our development of children’s products and services.
Conduct aggregate (meaning, data that cannot be associated with an individual child) analyses of product, service, and network performance.
Cooperate with law enforcement and protect the rights, safety, or property of our customers,
T-Mobile
, and others.
Comply with and enforce legal and regulatory obligations and respond to government requests.
Enforce our policies, terms and conditions, or other agreements.
Defend against or pursue claims, disputes, or litigation.
Data retention
We retain personal data, including children’s data, for business or tax needs, or legal reasons. We set our retention periods based on things like the type of personal data, the business purpose for which it was collected, and legal obligations to retain certain kinds of personal data.
When we share children’s data
We do not knowingly sell the personal data of children under 18. We also do not knowingly share the personal data of children under 18 for advertising purposes.
Sometimes we hire others to help us provide a product or service, and these service providers may need access to children’s data. They are required to keep children’s data we provide them confidential and to use it only to provide the services we requested.
We may also share children’s data with third parties, including the government, for legal processes or to protect life and safety where we believe that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the data is reasonably necessary.
For Project 10Million, we may also share aggregate versions of this data (meaning, data that cannot be associated with an individual child) with government agencies or schools.
Your rights and choices as a parent or guardian
Parents and guardians have rights and choices when it comes to their children’s data:
To change their mind and withdraw consent to the collection of their child(ren)’s personal data.
To consent to the sharing of their child(ren)’s data.
To see the personal data
T-Mobile
has collected about their child(ren), including getting a copy of the personal data in a form they can read, use, and transfer, where we can.
To ask us to delete or correct the personal data
T-Mobile
has collected about their child(ren).
Sometimes we can’t comply with your request. When that happens, residents of certain states are entitled to submit an appeal. Instructions for how to submit your appeal will be included in our response explaining why we couldn’t comply.
T-Mobile
customers can also designate lines as “Kids’ Lines” (as described above) to limit our use of data from the line. We may need to collect some data from you to confirm you’re the parent or guardian.
Of course, if you do exercise any of these rights or choices,
T-Mobile
will not treat you any differently.
Important
We need to collect your child’s data (as described above) to provide the relevant products or services. If you change your mind about giving consent or ask us to delete your child’s data, the product or service may no longer work.
In some cases, the only way for us to stop your child’s data from being collected might be to cancel your child’s service.
Future changes
We keep this privacy notice up to date. When we make changes, we’ll let you know by updating this notice and the date at the top of this page. In addition, prior to making a material change to how we use or share your child’s data, we’ll also reach out to you (e.g., by text or email or with your bill). If you keep using our products and services after we notify you, we’ll take that to mean you’re fine with the changes for any new data we collect. Those changes will not apply to previously collected personal data unless we get consent from impacted consumers.

Overview
Project 10Million provides school districts with a free
Wi-Fi
hotspot and 100GB of free data. As part of the service,
T-Mobile
collects, uses, and discloses certain information from children who may be under the age of 13 (“children”). The purpose of this privacy notice is to notify school districts and the parents and/or guardians of children under the age of 13 (“you” or “your”) of
T-Mobile

Children’s Privacy Notice
.
We need your consent to collect, use, and disclose personal information from your child(ren) in connection with the Project 10Million service. We will not collect, use, or disclose any personal information from your child(ren) if you do not provide such consent. The Federal Trade Commission has stated that a district or school may consent to such data collection, use, and disclosure on behalf of the parent or guardian to the extent such data collection, use, and disclosure is to provide services solely for the benefit of the school.
Customer has read this notice, consents on behalf of parents and guardians of children under 13 to the collection, use and disclosure practices described below, and authorizes
T-Mobile
to engage in such practices.

You have privacy rights, and
T-Mobile
has obligations,
when it comes to certain data about your voice communications.
By law, data about voice calls you make can only be used or shared for certain purposes,
or with your permission.
In some cases, we may be required by law
to share information about the service you use.
Your voice calls
As a telecommunications carrier, we collect and maintain information about our customers’ voice calls. We may use information about your voice-calling to identify offers for
T-Mobile
calling plans, protect against fraud, and respond to emergencies.
Some of the information we collect about your voice calls may be referred to as customer proprietary network information or CPNI. This information is collected solely because of your relationship with us. CPNI may include details such as the type, destination, and amount of your voice-calling. CPNI may also include certain information contained in your voice service bills. Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have created rules about how we handle CPNI that we follow to protect your privacy.
Your CPNI doesn’t include your name, address, phone number, or the content of your phone calls. Phone call content has stricter protections under wiretapping laws. To learn more about how
T-Mobile
collects information regarding phone calls, visit our
T-Mobile
Privacy Notice
.
Your choices
Under federal law, you have the choice to approve or disapprove certain uses of your CPNI that are outside the scope of ordinary business operations, fraud prevention, or legal compliance.
T-Mobile
does not use or share CPNI in ways that would trigger this approval process—like sharing your CPNI with others to help them market their stuff. You also have the option to access and manage your CPNI by visiting our
Privacy Dashboard
.
T-Mobile
also gives you tools to manage who can access your CPNI. For most of our brands, if you’re the Primary Account Holder, you may designate other lines as Authorized Users, who then also have rights to access and manage your account information. That allows you to decide whether other people on your account will also have access to all the CPNI associated with your account—not just the line they are using. For more information, visit the
Billing Responsible Party & authorized users
page.
Our responsibilities
The FCC’s rules are complex. Some of the key requirements are that carriers must:
Properly authenticate any party seeking access to CPNI. This means, for example,
T-Mobile
must provide mandatory password protection for online account access and require a valid photo ID for access in a retail location. We require a PIN code for any access to CPNI when you call us, and (except in Puerto Rico) we don’t release call details over the phone.
Notify you when your password or PIN is changed.
Investigate, notify you, and notify the FCC, FBI, and U.S. Secret Service if there’s intentional unauthorized access, use, or disclosure to your CPNI.
Annually file a certification with the FCC that we have processes in place designed to ensure compliance with the CPNI rules. We not only have to follow the law closely, we put our name on it.

History of the FPF Smart Places Initiative
> History of the FPF Smart Places Initiative
As of December 31, 2024, the Future of Privacy Forum will retire and no longer support the Smart Places Self-Regulatory Program, including the MAC Address Opt-Out previously hosted at www.smart-places.org. Read on to learn more about the history and the future of this initiative.
Brief History of Smart Places
The Smart Places Opt-Out and Code of Conduct (2013-2024) was a self-regulatory initiative administered by the Future of Privacy Forum that helped establish privacy standards for Mobile Location Analytics (MLA) technology. Through this program, participating venues and analytics companies committed to responsible data collection practices when tracking consumer movement patterns through WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses in physical spaces like stores, hotels, and airports.
Under the program’s 2013 Code of Conduct (updated in 2018), participating companies agreed to provide clear privacy notices, promptly de-identify collected MAC addresses, limit data retention, and honor consumer opt-out preferences submitted through a centralized opt-out system at smart-places.org. The program was designed to enable businesses to gather insights about customer traffic patterns and operational efficiency while respecting consumer privacy through transparency and choice.
After ten years, the Future of Privacy Forum is retiring this program in response to the changing technological and policy landscape regarding consumer MAC addresses.
What this Means for Participating Companies
Participating companies have been asked to update any internal or external policies that reference the smart-places.org opt-out mechanism, since it is no longer supported. We have also recommended that companies continue honoring existing opt-out signals for devices that were opted out between 2013-present, to the extent it is technically feasible, and that they take any other necessary technical steps, including deleting personal information where appropriate.
Although FPF is no longer supporting the Opt Out mechanism, participating companies remain committed to their own public statements regarding data privacy, and we invite them to continue to honor or exceed the privacy protections embodied in the 2013 Code of Conduct.
We have also asked our partners at PRIVO, the company that currently owns the technical infrastructure behind the Opt-Out, to delete any existing personal information related to devices that were opted out between 2013 and present. Read on to learn more about PRIVO.
What this Means for Individuals
For individuals who opted out by submitting any MAC address(es) for consumer device(s) between 2013 and present, we have requested that participating companies continue to honor those opt-out preferences to the extent it is technically feasible. Notably, the technological landscape with respect to MAC addresses has evolved in the last 10 years. For example, most leading consumer devices now randomize public-facing MAC addresses and other WiFi and Bluetooth signals. As a result, much of the previously opted-out information, particularly from older devices, may no longer be relatable to an identifiable person.
What’s Ahead: About PRIVO
In response to growing consumer demand for privacy, along with a tsunami of new youth associated privacy regulations, the minors’ privacy company PRIVO purchased the intellectual property for this initiative from FPF’s original vendor in 2023, and will be including it as an element of a timely, expanded program. The goal is to empower parents to take more control of their minor children’s data, while helping companies mitigate risks by leveraging a parent-authorized data protection service. PRIVO will be sharing more about the introduction of their new initiative, PRIVO PROTECT™ in coming months, and can be reached at

PRIVACY NOTICE
Effective:
September 28, 2022
Overview
T‑Mobile cares about the security of your personal information and wants to protect you and us against fraud. Where permitted by law, T‑Mobile and our contractors (“we”, “us”) use ID scanning and facial recognition technology to verify your identity and safeguard personal information as part of our security and fraud prevention efforts. This notice describes our collection and use of biometric data for these security and fraud prevention purposes.
When we refer to “biometric data,” we mean information about your physical or biological characteristics (some states call these “biometric identifiers”) that identify you. Information like eye, hand, or face scans; fingerprints; and voiceprints may be considered biometric data if
they are being used to identify you. The definitions of biometric data vary under different states’ laws. For example, some states’ biometric laws don’t apply to driver’s license photos. Photos of you are not biometric data, but biometric data can be made from processing the photo.
How we use your biometric data
When we scan your ID or take your photo, we may use the image to create a “biometric identifier.” We also collect other information from your ID. We use this information to verify that your ID is real, to protect your personal information from unauthorized disclosure, and to prevent fraud. We may compare your photo on the ID with: (1) the photos collected when you visit T‑Mobile and/or (2) photos of persons that may have been involved in fraudulent transactions with T‑Mobile or other companies, in the past. We monitor transactions for instances of fraud and may use related information, including biometric data, to protect T‑Mobile and others.
Why we collect, share, and store your biometric data
T‑Mobile will not collect, use, or store your biometric data without your consent. Also, T‑Mobile will not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from your biometric data. We will only disclose your biometric data or share the data with our contractors to provide the products or services you request. When a valid legal request is made, we may also share the biometric data with law enforcement.
When you consent to the creation and use of your biometric data through ID scan or other processes for identity verification or fraud prevention purposes, we will keep your biometric data for up to one year after you terminate your relationship with T‑Mobile. However, if we determine that a transaction may involve fraud, we may keep the biometric data and supporting information longer, as the law allows.
T‑Mobile will store, transmit, and protect your biometric data using the same degree of reasonable care as for similar confidential and sensitive information.
Your privacy choices
You may decline to have your ID scanned or photo taken, but this may limit the methods by which we protect you and your account from identity theft or other unauthorized disclosure of your personal data. If we are unable to verify your identity we cannot permit you to access or delete personal information in our systems.
If you grant consent for one-time use of your biometric data, we will delete the biometric data after that one use.
You may revoke your consent at any time by calling T‑Mobile Customer Care at 1-800-937-8997 (or 611 if you are a
T-Mobile
customer) or by visiting a T‑Mobile retail location. If you revoke consent for ongoing use, we will promptly stop using the biometric data and delete it.

Children’s Privacy
PRIVACY NOTICE
Updated:
March 12, 2024
Overview
We know it’s important to treat data that you tell us is from children under 18, and data from products and services we design for children under 18, very carefully. This Children’s Privacy Notice (“notice”) explains what we do (and don’t do) when it comes to children’s data.
Just looking for our general privacy notice? Read the
T-Mobile
Privacy Notice
.
What this notice covers
This notice applies to several products and services, including:
Kids’ privacy setting—Kids’ Line
T-Mobile
is currently testing the ability for parents and guardians to designate a line as a “Kids’ Line.” This feature enables parents to tell us that a line on their account is used by a child under the age of 18.
Project 10Million
Project 10Million provides families that qualify with a free
Wi-Fi
hotspot and 100GB of free data.
SyncUP KIDS Watch
The SyncUP KIDS Watch connects families with their children by enabling talk and text for approved contacts, real-time location tracking, and virtual boundary alerts.
FamilyMode and Safe & Found
FamilyMode and Safe & Found are two solutions that let parents manage and control their kids’ online activities and screen time across the family’s compatible devices.
This notice doesn’t apply to data collected by third party apps and websites, and we encourage parents to review the terms and policies of apps and websites before allowing children to use them. For more information, read the
Family Controls and privacy
article.
Children’s data we collect
We don’t knowingly collect data from or about children under 18 without the permission of their parent or guardian. When we do collect that data, we might do it
directly
, like when you sign up for a service. We might also collect it
automatically
if your child uses the products or services we offer.
Different products and services collect different kinds of data. The categories of children’s data that each product or service collected in the last twelve months are listed below.
Kids’ privacy setting—Kids’ lines
T-Mobile
is currently testing the ability for parents and guardians can designate a line as a “Kids’ Line.” This feature enables parents to tell us that a line on their account is used by a child under the age of 18. We won’t use data from designated Kids’ Lines for advertising, and we’ll opt the line out of receiving marketing communications from
T-Mobile
.
This feature is currently only available to customers with
T-Mobile
-branded rate plans, but we’re working hard to expand access to all customers soon. In the meantime, customers can opt out of the use of their data for advertising at any time through their account settings.
We collect the following data from Kids‘ Lines:
Geolocation Data
We collect data that tells us the location of your child’s mobile device.
Unique Identifiers
We collect device and network identifiers—basically, ways for us to tell which mobile device on our network is your child’s.
Age
We collect your child’s birth month and year so that we can tell when your child turns 18 and can change the line back to a regular line.
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)
CPNI is generated by your child’s use of our wireless voice communications services. For more information, read the
Phone privacy

Child interactions with device
This includes, for example, if the watch is turned on or off, if it enters or leaves airplane mode, watch battery charge level, child step counts, and other watch activity information. We collect these to provide notifications to you in the app about both your child’s activities and their watch status.

We also collect your child’s name and age directly from you when you set up the watch to help personalize the product. Age is optional but does allow us to enable additional features.
Please note, you can revoke your consent at any time and delete your child’s data by removing your child’s profile.
FamilyMode and Safe & Found
FamilyMode and Safe & Found are two solutions that let parents manage and control their kids’ online activities and screen time across the family’s compatible devices.
T-Mobile
and its vendor, Smith Micro, collect the following data via FamilyMode and Safe & Found:
Geolocation data
This tells us the location of your child’s device. This information is stored for 7 days.
Profile name and photo
These are used to customize the service.

Please note, you can revoke your consent at any time and delete your child’s data by either deleting your child’s profile or cancelling your FamilyMode or your Safe & Found subscription.
How we use children’s data
The main reason we collect children’s data is to provide the product or service that collected the data. But we may also use children’s data to do things like:
Create and administer accounts, complete transactions, payments, billing, and requests related to our products and services and third-party products and services charged to your accounts.
Check eligibility for a particular product or service.
Help stop fraudulent, malicious, deceptive, abusive, or unlawful activities.
Fix errors and ensure the quality, security, and safety of our products and services and network.
Guide our development of children’s products and services.
Conduct aggregate (meaning, data that cannot be associated with an individual child) analyses of product, service, and network performance.
Cooperate with law enforcement and protect the rights, safety, or property of our customers,
T-Mobile
, and others.
Comply with and enforce legal and regulatory obligations and respond to government requests.
Enforce our policies, terms and conditions, or other agreements.
Defend against or pursue claims, disputes, or litigation.
Data retention
We retain personal data, including children’s data, for business or tax needs, or legal reasons. We set our retention periods based on things like the type of personal data, the business purpose for which it was collected, and legal obligations to retain certain kinds of personal data.
When we share children’s data
We do not knowingly sell the personal data of children under 18. We also do not knowingly share the personal data of children under 18 for advertising purposes.
Sometimes we hire others to help us provide a product or service, and these service providers may need access to children’s data. They are required to keep children’s data we provide them confidential and to use it only to provide the services we requested.
We may also share children’s data with third parties, including the government, for legal processes or to protect life and safety where we believe that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the data is reasonably necessary.
For Project 10Million, we may also share aggregate versions of this data (meaning, data that cannot be associated with an individual child) with government agencies or schools.
Your rights and choices as a parent or guardian
Parents and guardians have rights and choices when it comes to their children’s data:
To change their mind and withdraw consent to the collection of their child(ren)’s personal data.
To consent to the sharing of their child(ren)’s data.
To see the personal data
T-Mobile
has collected about their child(ren), including getting a copy of the personal data in a form they can read, use, and transfer, where we can.
To ask us to delete or correct the personal data
T-Mobile
has collected about their child(ren).
Sometimes we can’t comply with your request. When that happens, residents of certain states are entitled to submit an appeal. Instructions for how to submit your appeal will be included in our response explaining why we couldn’t comply.
T-Mobile
customers can also designate lines as “Kids’ Lines” (as described above) to limit our use of data from the line. We may need to collect some data from you to confirm you’re the parent or guardian.
Of course, if you do exercise any of these rights or choices,
T-Mobile
will not treat you any differently.
Important
We need to collect your child’s data (as described above) to provide the relevant products or services. If you change your mind about giving consent or ask us to delete your child’s data, the product or service may no longer work.
In some cases, the only way for us to stop your child’s data from being collected might be to cancel your child’s service.
Future changes
We keep this privacy notice up to date. When we make changes, we’ll let you know by updating this notice and the date at the top of this page. In addition, prior to making a material change to how we use or share your child’s data, we’ll also reach out to you (e.g., by text or email or with your bill). If you keep using our products and services after we notify you, we’ll take that to mean you’re fine with the changes for any new data we collect. Those changes will not apply to previously collected personal data unless we get consent from impacted consumers.

Our privacy settings and policies don’t apply
when you’re using other websites or third-party apps.
Use your browser and Global Privacy Control
to help manage your online privacy.
Educate yourself
Even though we provide you access to the internet, we can’t control everything you may encounter on the web. When you use devices, apps, and websites that are developed by other companies, called third parties, their privacy policies apply.
For that reason, we recommend you check the privacy preferences on all your devices, apps, search engines, and at every website you visit. Here are a few helpful tips.
Manage your device
Most devices have controls where you can set your privacy preferences. You can decide whether apps and websites have permission to track your location, gain access to your photos, send personalized ads, and much more.
Be sure to check the settings and permissions for each of your apps and make changes that match your comfort level. You may also consider deleting apps that you don’t need or use.
While it’s important to be aware of your settings, sharing your personal information with third parties via your device can be a good thing. For example, by turning on location-based sharing, you can quickly find a restaurant near you or hail a ride with just a few clicks of an app. Turning off certain settings—like your location for maps—may cause apps to not function as you expect.
Be internet savvy
Websites and social media companies have their own settings and privacy policies around collecting personal information. Those companies may use or share your personal information to, for example, show you relevant ads when you use their services. Remember, how they collect and handle your personal information is outside of
T-Mobile
’s control.
Here are a few simple tips to protect yourself when posting and uploading photos on social media sites:
Be mindful about what personal information you’re sharing and with whom.
Consider making your social media account private where available.
Be thoughtful about accepting friend requests.
Use a unique, strong password for each account.
Protect your device with a password.
Check your privacy and ad settings on each platform.
Understand browser safety
Browsers give you access to the internet, but they can also give the internet access to you. Since each browser is different, be sure to check the “Help” menu of your browser’s settings to learn how to manage your privacy preferences. Here are a few suggestions:
Updates
Check often to make sure you have the latest version of your browser.
Cookies
You can set your browser to accept or reject cookies. A cookie is a small data file that a website sends to and stores on your browser. It allows the site to track your online activity or store information and/or settings.
Passwords
Create strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication. Also, consider using a password manager app rather than letting your browser save passwords for you.
Websites
Avoid clicking suspicious-looking links. Check to make sure the web address begins with HTTPS, not HTTP, which indicates a more secure connection. Only download apps and games from reliable sites.
Search engines
Consider using a privacy-focused search engine that’s compatible with Global Privacy Control. Read more below.
Global Privacy Control
You can also take advantage of a service
T-Mobile
participates in called Global Privacy Control (GPC) that lets you set a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” preference at the browser level.
Download a GPC-enabled browser at the
Global Privacy Control
website.
Activate or turn on the GPC setting in the browser or browser extension.
Your browser will send out a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” signal that participating websites, like ours, will respect.

Sensitive Data Disclosure.
We collect the following categories of sensitive personal data (as defined under certain state privacy laws): your Social Security number, driver’s license, government-issued identification card, or passport number, your account log in, financial account information, debit or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or information allowing access to an account, your precise location, what is in your text messages, biometric data, and children’s data. There may also be times when we’re able to see your citizenship or immigration status, such as when you use a visa or passport for identification. And there may be times when we’re able to see that you were the victim of a crime, such as when you provide us with a police report about the theft of your device. Unless you give us permission, we don’t collect or use this data to infer characteristics about you, and only use or disclose the data for purposes described in section 7027(m) of the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations. That means we only use it for things like providing services, processing transactions, complying with laws, managing our business, preventing fraud, harm, or other illegal actions, and securing your data and our network. Unless you give us permission, we don’t “sell” or “share” sensitive personal data for purposes of “cross-context behavioral advertising,” which is targeted advertising that tracks your activity across different websites, applications, and services.
De-identified Data.
We may de-identify, aggregate or anonymize personal data or collect data that has been de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized. We don’t try to re-identify this data (i.e. re-associate it with an individual person), except as necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of our de-identification policies and procedures.
How we share data
Here are the general categories of personal data we disclose for a business purpose, share for targeted advertising, or sell. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal data of minors under 18 years of age.

Affiliates and business transition and acquisitions.
We may share personal data with our other companies (e.g., sister companies, or other companies under common control). If another company purchases, or plans to buy, our company, or things that we own, we may also share personal data with that company, including at the beginning stage of the purchase.

Data collected for specific purposes.
The content in the
Data we collect
section discusses how we share information in connection with specific contexts.
Other disclosures with your consent.
We may share personal data with other third parties when we have your consent or direction to do so.
Other disclosures without your consent.
We may share personal data in connection with any legal process, to enforce our agreements, to defend ourselves, to collect payment, to comply with laws, to investigate possible illegal activities or a violation of our policies, to protect a person, to protect property, or to help prevent fraud or abuse.
Professional services.
We may share personal data with our professional service providers, like our auditors or lawyers.
Your choices
We offer you certain choices related to your personal data:
Access.
You may request access to your personal data or confirmation that we have data about you. We will provide access to your data in a portable and machine-readable format. For multi-line accounts, the individual in charge of your account that submits an access request will receive account-level data for all lines on the account (e.g., billing and rate plan information). Personal data associated with a particular phone number on the account will not be shared with them. If you’re not in charge of the account, you’ll only see data that is associated with your phone number.
Analytics and Reporting.
You may opt out of having the data from your
T-Mobile
device aggregated as part of our Analytics and Reporting program by going to our
Privacy Dashboard
.
Changes.
Most of our websites allow you to change your account profile. For changes that can’t be made through your account profile, you can request that we correct your personal data.
Deletion.
You may request that we delete your personal data. Note that in many situations we must keep some of your personal data for our business purposes, like providing service to you, detecting security problems, or complying with our legal obligations.
Marketing emails or texts.
You can adjust your marketing communication preferences in our
Privacy Dashboard
. To learn more, read the
Your marketing preferences
article.
Do not sell or share.
You may opt out of having your data sold or shared by us, which includes having it used for targeted advertising or for third parties to use for direct marketing, by going to our
Privacy Dashboard
or using the “Do Not Share or Sell My Personal Information” link on our websites or apps. If you’ve opted in to our Personalized Ads & Offers program, you may also need to withdraw your consent via the Privacy Dashboard to be removed from that program. We recognize the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal broadcast from certain web browsers as an opt-out request, but we don’t recognize the “do not track” signal because there isn’t a universal standard for how to apply it. Read our
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
article for more information.
Profiling and automated decisions.
You can tell us not to use your personal data for certain kinds of “profiling” that we might do in the future by visiting our
Privacy Dashboard
to opt out. “Profiling” is a specific type of activity under certain privacy laws and generally refers to the automated processing of personal data to evaluate, analyze, or predict certain personal aspects about your performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements. You can opt out of having profiling used for future decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects on you.
These choices may not apply in every circumstance. In some cases, we might limit or deny your request because the law allows or requires us to do so. We might also deny your request if we can’t verify who you are. We won’t discriminate against you for making one of these choices.
To make an access, change, or deletion request please
submit a personal data request
. We’re required to verify your identity before we can give you access to, change, or delete your personal data. So, you’ll need to provide some data for us to do the verification. This includes your email address and phone number, or your
T-Mobile
ID and password. If you don’t have a
T-Mobile
ID, you may need to provide your U.S. driver’s license, state ID, or passport. We may also need a photo of your face so we can ensure the photo ID belongs to you. In some cases, you may designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf.
If you disagree with our denial of a request, you may be entitled to submit an appeal. If that’s the case, we’ll include instructions for how to submit your appeal in our response.
We won’t use, disclose, sell, or permit access to Maine broadband “customer personal information” unless you give us permission, or it’s allowed by Maine law. If you’re a Maine customer, you have rights you can exercise in our
Privacy Dashboard
.
Under California’s Shine the Light law, California customers may request information about whether a business has disclosed personal data (as defined in that law) to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We don’t do that without your permission.
