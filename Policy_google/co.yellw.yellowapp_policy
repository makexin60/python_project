”) or visit our website, we collect information about you.
1. OUR CORE VALUES
We are driven by two core values when providing our products and services:
We highly value your privacy
. It means that all the features on Yubo have been built to be privacy-oriented from day one and so that we do not have to seek data that we do not need. It is called "
privacy by design
".

2. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
Twelve-App publishes Yubo, a social network that enables you to make friends and engage with them, in particular through live video. It also publishes
www.yubo.live
.
Twelve-App is the “controller” of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy, unless specified otherwise. We are a French company and our head office is at 59 rue de Ponthieu, bureau 562, 75008 Paris, France.
3. DATA WE COLLECT
3.1. Data you provide to us directly
Sign-up data.
To use Yubo, you need to create an account. To do so, we ask you to provide basic personal information such as your phone number, name, and date of birth. You’ll need to pick a username and a password. We also require you to upload at least one profile picture showing your face, and to take a photo selfie to estimate your age from your facial features, to make sure that it is consistent with your birthdate.
We may offer a simplified sign-up process using Apple ID log-in or Google log-in. In this case, we will receive personal data from Apple or Google, such as your name, Google or Apple ID and your email address (you may choose not to provide some data depending on Google or Apple policies). Such data will only be used to set up your Yubo account.
You may also complete your profile with optional information: gender, emoji, bio, and email address. Users who are at least 18 years old can also provide information on their profession and education.
Private details like your email address, your birthdate, your phone number, your gender and the photo selfie used for age estimation are not publicly visible.
Your interaction(s) with us.
If you report a user or content on Yubo, request help, make a claim, participate in a survey or exercise your privacy rights (as mentioned in Section 9 below), we will process the information contained therein. We will also process information if another user reports you. This kind of information is not shared nor visible to other users.
Profile verification.
On Yubo, you can verify your profile to get a yellow checkmark on your profile. This will help other users know that your profile is legitimate and not fake. We can also require you to get verified if there is a serious safety concern related to your account. To verify your profile, we need a valid ID, as well as a selfie that we will compare with the photos in your profile. You can choose to be verified manually by a specialist or automatically using our technology. If you choose the automated option, and if you consent, we will collect your facial geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some countries. The automated option is not available for users under 16 years old.
Your location (GPS coordinates).
Subject to your consent, we collect and process data concerning your location. This allows you, depending on your settings, to display the city where you are located in your profile and to add people around you as friends. In addition, this location service based on GPS data is not available to users under 15 years old. Other restrictions may apply depending on your age, country and applicable laws.
Your approximate location (IP Address)
: If geolocation based on GPS data is not activated or is not available to you as explained above, we collect your approximate location - such as your city - derived from your IP address to deliver a better experience.
The contents you share on Yubo.
When you use features available on Yubo we will process and store the contents you share such as photos, videostream and messages. We also need to process the technical data associated with the content you post (such as the date, device information, IP address).
You should always be aware that the content you share on Yubo may be viewed by other users with whom you are interacting, who may save your content through their device (for example by taking a screenshot of their phone).
When using Yubo, we do not encourage you to share sensitive information such as data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, your political opinions, religious beliefs, or data concerning your health, your sex life, or your sexual orientation.
It is, however, your freedom of expression to do so as long as you respect the rules in force on the platform. In this case, you should be aware that you are manifestly making this information public.
Access to your camera, photos, and videos.
In order to send and upload your photos or videos from your device and use the live video feature, we need your permission to access your media and your camera.
3.2. Data we collect automatically when you use our services
Information on user acquisition.
With your permission, we collect technical information such as your advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset in your device’s settings) to help us measure the performance of our marketing campaigns and attribution (more information in Section 4.3 below).
Information about your activity on Yubo.
Your use of our services leads to the collection of the following data:
the YUBO id associated with your account,
the date you signed up,

your interactions with the YUBO features and other users (such as the number of likes or dislikes via the swipe feature).

Other users.
We may receive information from other users, especially in user-generated content, support requests and user reports.
Business partners.

4. HOW WE USE YOUR DATA
We mostly need to access, use and/or share your personal data to provide you with the services offered on Yubo and to create a safe, smooth and high-quality experience for you. To give you more details and examples, you can read below the list of purposes for which your data may be used.
4.1. To manage your account and your relationship with Yubo, and to make the app features available to you
Create and manage your user account (including access to Yubo services and Help). Depending on your jurisdiction, we may request parental permission before you can use Yubo.
Allow you to enjoy the features available on Yubo and that you request, including watching or streaming live videos, using the swipes to make new friends, adding fun content in your profile or in other features, sending messages and photos to your friends, purchase paid items and/or subscriptions if you wish. We may also offer services provided by third parties. In particular, we allow you to broadcast videos from YouTube, via the YouTube API Services. For more information on how YouTube processes your data, please consult YouTube’s privacy policy here:
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy
.
If you want to, get your account verified to get a yellow checkmark (see Section 3.1. for more information on profile verification).
Get your account ‘verified’. If you choose to have a verified account, we will use your facial geometry (considered Biometric Information in some jurisdictions) to compare your selfie to your profile photos. This helps us verify that you are not a fake profile.
Manage and store messages exchanged between users who have become friends and live videos.
Where appropriate, show you offers and content we think you’ll like, in particular when using certain paid services (e.g., Yubo’s ‘Power Pack’);
Manage and respond to your requests, questions and complaints addressed to our support team.
We rely on our
Terms of Use
as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.1. Remember that these terms constitute a contract between you and Twelve-App.
In addition, we ask for your
consent
where required to by law. Typically, this may occur if we need parental consent for you to join Yubo in some jurisdictions. Also, if you choose the automated verification option, we ask for your consent to verify your profile because facial geometry data analysis may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions.
4.2. To improve our services and the user experience
Measure how you use our services, which features you like the most, which ones you like less, make usage statistics of our app, and analyze them.
Create and develop new features on Yubo, and perform tests before launching new features.
Understand the technical issues you may encounter, to resolve them.
Manage our internal communication and marketing activities, such as the animation of the Yubo community, or internal statistical studies.
Evaluate the quality of our responses when you contact our support team.
Suggest your profile to other users and show you profiles to make new friends, based on your settings, location, activity and profile information.
Improve the user experience, the technical operation of the app, and the way users can communicate through the app.
We rely on
Twelve-App’s legitimate interests
as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.2. so that we understand your expectations and make your experience on Yubo fun and smooth.
4.3. To provide tailored services and access to some information from your device
Personalization of services according to location data, to show you live videos nearby, or suggestions of friends nearby. The distance cannot be less than 30km.
Access to your device's photo album, camera and micro to share images, videos and sound on Yubo.
To improve the quality of our augmented reality experiences, information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time. We don’t store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.
Help us measure the performance of our marketing campaigns and attribution. It allows us for example to determine from which site or app you downloaded Yubo. Consult our
Cookie Policy
for more information.
Send you push notifications containing information about our products, safety updates, and interactions with other users.
Show you ads (i) so you can use free features on Yubo and (ii) to allow you to participate in the Ads with Rewards program if you wish, giving you the opportunity to earn YuBucks by viewing ads. These ad programs may not be available to all users, depending on their age, country, and applicable laws. Check out our
Cookie Policy
for more information.
We rely on your
consent
as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.3 where consent is the legal basis required under applicable laws.
You may withdraw your consent whenever you want or opt out of the processing of your data (depending on applicable laws). Your consent or right to opt out is usually managed via the settings of Yubo and/or of your device.
4.4. To ensure and enhance online safety on Yubo
Enforcement of policies to moderate content and profiles that go against our
Community Guidelines
. We can review your profile and activity and take action in the event of a safety issue. This may include actions like sending you a warning, removing or filtering inappropriate content,  requiring you to get verified, or suspending your account temporarily or permanently. Actions that may materially affect your use of Yubo (such as a permanent ban) are decided by moderators, according to our internal policies. Some content can be automatically filtered to prevent users from being exposed to it. We may take security measures on Yubo based on your activity on a third-party platform that is brought to our attention.
Development and use of automated technologies to detect violations of our
Community Guidelines
and/or manifestly illicit content
. These technologies can scan content (notably text, photos and videos) and detect violations of our rules. We strive to detect violations such as violence, drug use, child abuse, spam, and sexually explicit, hateful, or discriminatory content as quickly as possible, even before they are reported. These tools support our moderation efforts and allow us to take immediate action when such violations happen.
Development and implementation of procedures and technologies to fight against fraudulent profiles, and to appropriately identify our users
.
To this end:
- We automatically detect if your profile picture shows your face.
- We will ask you to verify your identity before accessing your Yubo account if we have reasonable doubts about you based on your activity and your profile information.
- We also request to estimate your age from a picture of your face. Our facial age estimation is an age-checking technology provided by our partner Yoti that can estimate a person’s age by algorithmically assessing their facial features. We only receive the result of the age estimation carried out by Yoti, who does not keep the photo or any facial geometry data.
Account tracking
. We temporarily flag users who we believe are engaging in unsafe or unlawful conduct on Yubo. Flagging these accounts allows our moderators to conduct investigations and take moderation action, if necessary.
Evaluation of the performance of our safety procedures, policies, and technologies
mentioned in this Section 4.4, in order to improve them and develop new ones that we think could be more effective in improving your well-being and safety on Yubo. This includes, for example, the quality review of the work done by our moderators and support specialists, and training of our automated technologies to improve their accuracy over time.
We rely on
Twelve-App’s legitimate interests
as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.4. so that Yubo remains a safe and respectful place of expression and safeguards the trust of our users.
We also rely on our
Terms of Use
to enforce them in the event of a violation of our Terms of Service and/or our
Community Guidelines
.
In jurisdictions where analysis of a photo for age estimation or profile verification purposes is considered biometric data, we request your
consent
to process this information.
4.5. To comply with our legal obligations and cooperate with authorities.
Implementation of a reporting functionality available to users
and embedded in all app’s features. This allows you to report users or content that you believe violates our
Community Guidelines
. The reports you submit will then be reviewed by our moderators, who will take action against the reported content or user where appropriate.
Assist law enforcement and remove manifestly unlawful content
. We are required to contribute to the fight against criminal offenses online, to promptly remove or disable access to unlawful content as soon as we become aware of it, to notify competent authorities of some types of infringements, and to preserve data for investigations upon request.
Compliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirement
. This notably includes the processing of your requests to exercise your privacy rights in accordance with Section 9.
We rely on
the relevant legal obligation
to which we are subject as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.5.
Also note that, if necessary, we will use personal information to exercise or defend our legal rights in court, relying on our
legitimate interest(s)
.
4.6. To manage life-threatening emergency situations for anyone using our services
.
Report to competent authorities
. We will report situations or content presenting a life threat (such as self-harm or violence) to the competent authorities. Our moderators are trained to identify situations requiring urgent reporting to authorities, depending on the context; they create internal reports to be examined before being transmitted to the competent authorities.
User assistance
. Our specialists provide users in distress with relevant information and documentation.
We rely on the protection of the
vital interests
of any natural person as a legal basis for processing personal data under this Section 4.6.

5.1. Account Validity Period
We keep your personal information as long as we need it to enable you to use our services.

meaning that you do not access the app for a continuous period of two years.
5.2. Specific Data Retention Periods
Not all the data we process have the same retention period, in particular regarding the following types of data:
Direct messages are deleted after two years and photos sent in the chat are deleted after one year.
Videos and images from live videos are deleted quickly (within minutes to hours). Only screenshots of the live videos may be kept longer if the live videos are reported or if violations of our
Community Guidelines
are detected.
We will retain content that is in violation of our Community Guidelines for a certain period of time, even if that content has been removed from the Yubo platform. The retention period may vary depending on the type of content and the type of violation.
Your interactions with our support team can be kept for up to 5 years after the ticket is closed. It helps us follow up on our actions regarding support and defend ourselves in the event of a claim or legal action.
Your geolocation (i.e. your device’s GPS data), if enabled, is kept until your next access to Yubo; then it is replaced by your current geolocation.
Verification data: ID documents to verify an account are deleted a few days after verification. Facial geometry scans are immediately deleted after the process. We only store your real-time selfie image as long as your profile remains active on Yubo to maintain your verification.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.1 and 5.2. above, we will retain some personal data for an additional period of time if we are legally required to do so. We may also need to keep personal information for the time necessary to resolve a dispute or to exercise or defend our legal rights.

regarding your personal data and privacy rights.
Rule #1: Data at a Minimum.
We need some data like a picture of your face and your date of birth to identify you on Yubo for everyone's safety.
We also process some information related to your device for technical reasons and data related to the content you post on Yubo, so we can share it with other users on the platform.
You do not have to provide us with any information that we do not absolutely need, such as your email address, interests, gender, etc. All of this information is optional.
Rule #2: Data Sharing Practices.
We share users’ personal data mainly with our service providers. These companies provide us with IT tools that process data to help us run our services. For example, to host the data in data centers, or to sort and analyze data in databases.
User data can be accessed by our authorized employees, for example by our moderators who ensure safety on the app.
Data is also shared with business partners, especially to serve ads on the app. In this example, these are companies that act as intermediaries between advertisers and platforms like Yubo. Ads may not be shown to all users depending on their age and local restrictions.
Finally, personal data may be shared with the relevant authorities if serious offenses are committed on Yubo.
Rule #3: Data for Your Safety
Moderation is necessary for the safety of everyone on Yubo. We have to process personal data in order to moderate content. For example, if a content violates our
Community Guidelines
, our moderators must identify the content in violation and apply necessary actions to the user.
We also use technology to automatically detect violations of our guidelines, filter inappropriate content, or send you alerts to remind you of our rules, and also to automatically verify your age when you sign up.
We train and supervise the algorithms so that they perform well and make as few errors as possible. Content detected by the algorithms may be processed not only for safety purposes but also to improve their accuracy and our safety measures.
Children who are 13 years old or younger are not allowed to use Yubo.
Therefore, we require you to estimate your age at sign-up via a partnership with Yoti, an industry-leading age estimation system. We may also require you to verify your identity if we suspect that you lied about your age or if you are engaged in inappropriate or unlawful conduct on Yubo.

Rule #4: Data for a Better Experience.
We only use your data to provide our services and improve your experience on Yubo. You can set your swipe or live video settings as you wish, and you can post content on Yubo like your bio, a private message, or a video. We need to store this content on our servers so that it can function online.
To improve the platform we watch trends, notice how you use Yubo, what features you like and dislike, and other usage metrics. We are not interested in getting to know your individual activity, but rather understand how our community uses Yubo so we can grow the app in that direction.
Rule #5: No Geolocation of Under 15s.
Location services allow us to locate you to give you a better experience on the app.
The geolocation options we offer may vary according to your country, your age, and applicable laws. We can provide (i) a geolocation service (based on the GPS coordinates of your device) subject to your prior consent, or (ii) an approximate location service (based on your IP address).
Rule #6: Your Settings, Your Privacy.
Yubo is designed with privacy protection at its core. This means that you can control your data through the in-app settings:
Go to ‘
Account
’ if you’d like to rectify some data;
Go to ‘
Safety and Privacy
’ if you’d like to manage your permissions, blocked users, add or remove muted words, or request your data.
Go to ‘
Push notifications
’ if you’d like to allow us, or not, to send you notifications.
Go to ‘
Swipe settings
’ if you’d like to manage swipe specification or if you would prefer us to hide your profile from appearing in swipes..
Go to ‘
Delete Account
’ if you’d like to leave Yubo and remove your profile.
If you are under 18, we strongly encourage you to ask your parents or a trusted adult before changing your privacy settings, especially if you wish to lower them.
More information about your account settings can be found
here
.
Rule #7: Cookies for improved performance
We use technologies like cookies to track your interactions and actions on Yubo. For example, to see what features you have used, to figure out what you like and dislike on the app, and to better the ads you will see. It also allows us to identify any technical problems you may be experiencing.
Basically, these tools can collect technical information (like your phone model or operating system) and it helps us improve the app and your experience on Yubo.
Go to your settings >
Safety and privacy
>
Personalization and data
>
Privacy Preferences
to manage your choices about cookies.
When required by law, we ask for your consent before running these tools.
Rule #8: Our Commitment to Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations.
As you may know, Yubo is available in many countries, where data protection laws may vary. For instance:
The
General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’)
applies throughout the European Union, and the
UK General Data Protection Regulation
applies in the United Kingdom.
State privacy laws apply in the United States of America, such as the
Consumer California Privacy Act
, the
Colorado Privacy Act
, the
Connecticut Act Concerning Privacy and Online Monitoring
, the
Utah Consumer Privacy Act
, and the
Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act
.
We take into account local requirements when providing our services. However, be aware that your rights may be different depending on your country of residence.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.

A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
