I. OUR COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We collect personal information in a variety of ways. For example, you may provide us with your personal information when you make a purchase, list an item for sale, send us messages, subscribe to our mailing lists, newsletters or other forms of marketing communications, or use some other feature of our Services.
We may link or combine information collected from you on our Sites and Apps with information we have collected from you offline (e.g., in-person), information we receive from third parties, as well as information we collect automatically through tracking technologies (defined below). This allows us to, for example, provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us.
The personal information we collect, the way we collect it, and how we use it will depend on how you are interacting with us and the type of services you use.
Personal Information Collected from You
Account Information
, including name, email address, phone number, username and password, location, profile information, and any other information you provide to us. We use this information to administer your account, provide you with the relevant service and information, communicate with you regarding your account and your use of the Services, and for fraud prevention and customer support purposes. Please note that other users may see your username and/or location (if you enable location services and grant permission) on the Services.
Buyer Information
, including name, email address, shipping and billing address, and payment card and billing information, if you choose to make a purchase. Please note that we use third-party payment processors to process credit card payments made to us. As such, we do not retain any personally identifiable financial information in connection with credit card payments, such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly by you to our third-party payment processor. The payment processor’s use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy.
Seller Information
, including name, email address, shipping and billing address, bank information and payment card and billing information, if you choose to list an item for sale on one of our platforms. Please note that we use third-party payment processors to process credit card payments made to us. As such, we do not retain any personally identifiable financial information in connection with credit card payments, such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly by you to our third-party payment processor and may be kept on file with such third-party payment processor to cover certain applicable charges incurred by a seller. The payment processor’s use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy.
Identity and Compliance Information
, including name, birthdate, address, phone number, email address, bank account information, government ID number, VAT ID number or other tax ID number, and copies of government ID or tax documents, along with a selfie image. We may use data collection and verification services provided by a third-party provider, Persona, to collect and verify such information in order to comply with our legal obligations and protect against fraud and abuse. Persona may use a combination of machine-learning tools and optical scans to verify your identity document and may use facial recognition technology to produce a unique biometric identifier based on facial geometry that can be used to compare your selfie to the image on the identity document you provide to determine the likelihood that the images are a "match." We do not receive the biometric identifier generated from the images. It is generated and held by Persona until we inform them that the biometric identifier is no longer needed for the purposes described in this paragraph and must be destroyed. For identity verification and security purposes, we will have access to the selfie image and will receive the information extracted from the scan of the government ID document as well as the results of the verification process. We may use this process and associated information to verify your identity and your identity documents, comply with legal obligations and protect against fraud and abuse. We do not use, disclose or retain your biometric information for any other commercial purpose. Our third-party provider, Persona, processes this information on our behalf strictly in accordance with our contractual agreements. For more information on Persona’s data processing practices, please see

IV. DATA RETENTION
We will usually store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and in accordance with our legitimate business interests and applicable law. However, if necessary, we may retain personal information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator or other government authority.
To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations.
For example, if you reside in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or the State of California, your personal information may be subject to certain laws and regulations that define the criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained, which varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:
Contract
. Where we are processing personal information is based on contract, we generally will retain your personal information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from our contractual relationship.
Legitimate Interests
. Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account your fundamental interests and your rights and freedoms.
Consent
. Where we are processing personal information based on your consent, we generally will retain your personal information until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.
Legal Obligation
. Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain your personal information for the time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation.
Legal Claim
. We may need to apply a “legal hold” that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim or intent to establish a claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
When an individual discontinues the use of our Services, we will retain their personal information for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as, for any additional purpose based on the choices they have made, such as to receive marketing communications. We will retain personal information supplied when joining our Services, including complaints, claims and any other personal information supplied during the duration of an individual’s contract with us for the Services until the statutory limitation periods have expired, when this is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Once retention of the personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or deidentify the personal information or, if this is not possible (e.g., because personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal information and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.
V. CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16. If an individual is under the age of 16, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete that personal information.

Privacy Policy applicable to individuals verifying their identity through the Persona Service
Persona’s Customers offer the Persona service (the “Service”) to securely verify the identity of individuals (“you”). Persona processes Personal Data of individuals at the direction of its Customers. This section of the Privacy Policy explains how Persona, under the direction of its Customers, processes Personal Data in order to provide the Service for its Customers. Personal Data provided to Persona by Customers, and Personal Data provided to Customers from Persona, is subject to the Customers’ Privacy Policy. This section explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect through the Service, how we use and share that data, and how individuals can exercise choices regarding their Personal Data.
How We Collect and Use Personal Data to Provide the Service
This section describes the Personal Data we collect and how we use it in order to provide the Service to our Customers. Personal Data means information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.
You provide Personal Data to us at the direction of our Customers so that our Customer may verify your identity and/or prevent fraud. In the course of performing the Service, we may also obtain Personal Data from other sources such as third party databases, government records, and other publicly available sources. The Personal Data we collect varies based on what you provide, what the Customer has directed us to analyze, and what Personal Data is available from third parties.
You may directly provide:
Name and contact information
, including name, email address, address, and phone number;
Demographic data
, including birthdate and age;
Files you upload,
such as tax forms and utility bills;
Government documents, barcodes, and identifiers
, such as driver's license and Social Security Number; and
Audio, Video, and Photos of you,
namely from the selfie you provide and from your government identification document.
Our Services may also collect the following from you, our Customer, or third parties:
Current and previous name and contact information
, including name, email address, address, and phone number;
Demographic data
, including birthdate and age, gender, marital status, and similar demographic details;
Government documents, barcodes, and identifiers
, such as drivers license and Social Security Numbers;
Device information
, including IP address, device type, your device’s operating system, browser, cookie and device identifiers, and other software including type, version, language, settings, and configuration;
Account information
, such as details about your account with our Customer or other third parties;
Geolocation data;
and
Biometric Data
, including a scan of your facial geometry based on the photos you provide. For more information about Biometric Data, see the Facial Scan and Biometrics Information section below.
Based on the Personal Data we collect from you and other sources, we infer information about you for identity verification and fraud prevention purposes.  For example, we may use certain information about you including your IP address and home address to inform our verification process.
Some data that we collect automatically is collected through cookies and similar technologies.  See our  Cookies section below to learn more.
We use Personal Data to provide our Customers with the Service so they can verify the identity of individuals and prevent fraud. This processing is necessary to perform our contract with our Customers. As part of performing the Service, we use Personal Data to improve and troubleshoot our Services.
Wireless Operator Authorization
To assist our customers  in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, you authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to us or our service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help them identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. See this Privacy Policy for how we treat your data.
How We Disclose Personal Data
We may engage third parties to assist us in providing the Services, in which case we may disclose Personal Data to them. We may also disclose Personal Data to service providers, including hosting, cloud services and other information technology services providers; email communication and SMS software providers; and identity verification services, mobile device operators, background check providers, public and private records database providers, consumer reporting services, and fraud and identity management providers. For example, we may disclose your name and address to a third party database provider in order to request information they may have about you. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process or store Personal Data while performing their duties to us. We may also disclose Personal Data when required to do so by law.
Facial Scan and Biometrics Information
This section describes how Persona treats scans of facial geometry extracted from photos.
Persona, acting as a service provider to the Customer:
compares the data from a scan of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document that you upload to the data from a scan of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload, in order to help verify your identity (“Verification”); and
may also use your information, including data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, to detect and prevent fraud (“Fraud Prevention”).
The images obtained from government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, and data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, are collected, used and stored directly by Persona on behalf of Customer as Customer’s service provider through Customer’s website or app that you accessed.  Depending on our relationship with the Customer, the Customer may upload your government identification document and photos of your face directly to us.
Persona securely stores all photos of identity documents that you upload, photos of your face that you upload, and data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload in an encrypted format. Persona’s
third-party vendors
may have access to the data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload to provide some or all of the analysis, to store the data, to maintain backup copies, and to service the systems on which such data is stored. Persona will permanently destroy data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload upon completion of Verification or within three years of your last interaction with Persona, consistent with the Customer’s instructions unless Persona is otherwise required by law or legal process to retain the data.
Persona uses the reasonable standards of care within its industry to store, transmit, and protect from disclosure data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload in a manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which it stores, transmits, and protects other confidential and sensitive information. Persona will not sell, lease, trade, or, other than to provide the Verification and Fraud Prevention services to Customer described in this policy, otherwise benefit from data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload. Other than as set forth herein, Persona will not disclose, redisclose, or otherwise disseminate data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload unless doing so:
Completes a Customer transaction requested and authorized by you or your legally authorized representative;
Is required by state or federal law, or municipal ordinance;
Is required pursuant to a warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or
Is expressly consented to by you.
Choices Regarding Personal Data
Persona is the data processor for the processing of Personal Data on behalf of its Customers. If you are an individual whose identity has been verified through Persona, please contact the appropriate Customer to exercise any rights that you may have under applicable law. If you have further concerns or questions regarding the processing of your Personal Data, please email

You have a right to request that we disclose to you the Personal Data we have collected about you.  You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such Personal Data. Note that we have provided much of this information in this privacy policy. You may make such a “request to know” by emailing us at
privacy@withpersona.com
.
Rights to Request Correction or Deletion.
You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Data and that we delete Personal Data under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to correct or delete, email us at
privacy@withpersona.com
.
Right to Opt-Out / “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”.
You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” or “sharing” of Personal Data as those terms are defined by the CCPA.
The CCPA/CPRA requires us to describe the categories of Personal Data we sell and/or share to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales or sharing.  The CCPA/CPRA defines “sell,” “share,” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this privacy policy may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under those definitions, such as  disclosing Personal Data to third parties for our own advertising purposes. We let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses and cookie IDs along with associated device and usage data when you access our website, but we do not “sell” or “share” any other types of Personal Data.
If you do not wish for us or our partners to “sell” or “share” Personal Data relating to your visits to our websites for advertising purposes, you can make your request by clicking on
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
page, using a Global Privacy Control, or emailing us at
privacy@withpersona.com
. If you opt-out using these choices, we will not share or make available such Personal Data in ways that are considered a “sale” or “sharing” under the CCPA.  However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some Personal Data to help us perform advertising-related functions. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” or “shared” Personal Data or stop all interest-based advertising.
We do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.
You have a right to limit our use of sensitive Personal Data for any purposes other than to provide the services or goods you request or as otherwise permitted by law. Note that we do not use Sensitive Personal Data for any such additional purposes.
You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA/CPRA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
Further, to provide, correct, or delete specific pieces of Personal Data will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account. For some types of Personal Data we may have, there may be no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity as the person to whom that data relates.
Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA/CPRA.
Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided Personal Data to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Data to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
Please be aware that we do not disclose Personal Data to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.
California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing
privacy@withpersona.com
. Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated e-mail address.
