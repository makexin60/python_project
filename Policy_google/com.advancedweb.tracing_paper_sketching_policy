Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect and how we use it.
In short: we do not collect or use any information.

1. Analytics information
We do not use third-party analytics tools. The App does not access a dedicated backend service, so we do not record log file information.

2. Private data
We do not collect any private information, since the App is available without authentication. We also does not track information regarding the opened images.

For technical reasons the application accesses the following personal and device related information without actually storing or using them:
- Advertising ID
- Android Device ID


Changes to the Privacy Policy
=============================

We may change the Privacy Policy without further notice. If we do, we will post the changes to this page. If you continue to use the App after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy.
