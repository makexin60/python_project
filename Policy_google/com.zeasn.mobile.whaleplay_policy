Service Providers.
We may engage trusted third-party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf, such as IT support, email management, website hosting, and marketing. These service providers act as data processors, and we grant them access to your personal data only to the extent necessary for them to perform their services. For example, this website is hosted by an external service provider, and any personal data collected through the website (such as IP addresses, contact requests, meta and communication data, contractual data, contact details, names, and website access logs) is stored on the web host’s servers. These service providers are contractually obligated to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure the protection of your personal data and to process such data only in accordance with our instructions. The legal basis for this transfer is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, which relates to the performance of a contract with our (potential) website users.
Legal Requirements.
We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities, such as to comply with an official or court order. This disclosure is based on Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR, which allows for processing necessary to comply with a legal obligation.
Business Transfers.
In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of the transaction. This transfer will be conducted in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
With Your Consent or Other Legal Grounds.
We will forward your data to third parties if we have obtained your explicit consent (based on Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR) or if the forwarding is required to protect our legitimate interests, provided these interests are not overridden by your rights (also under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR)
.
Data Storage and Security
Your personal data may be stored and processed in Singapore or other jurisdictions where we or our service providers operate. We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We participate in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and comply with its Specifications and Policies. We use the Consent Management Platform with the identification number 300.
We work hard to protect both you and us from unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of, the information we hold. Our security measures include:
Encryption:
We use encryption to keep your data private during transit.
Regular Reviews:
We regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices to prevent unauthorized access to our systems.
Access Restrictions:
We restrict access to personal information to our employees, service providers, and vendors who need that information to process it. Anyone with access to personal data is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
All our products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. Insights gained from the maintenance of our services help us detect and automatically block security threats before they reach you. If we detect a significant risk to your personal information that we believe you should know about, we will promptly notify you and provide guidance on steps you can take to protect yourself better.
However, please be aware that while we strive to protect your personal data, no method of Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is entirely secure. If you believe that your account or personal information has been compromised, please contact us immediately as outlined in the "Contact Us" section of this Privacy Policy.
