How Fun Of Vegas Uses Your Information
Fun Of Vegas uses your information to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games, to operate, and optimize our Services, to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience, to fulfill your specific requests and purchase orders, and to send you other account-related information. In addition, the personal information you provide will allow Fun Of Vegas to send you messages regarding, among other things, in-games (in-app) updates, new products, features, enhancements, special and promotional offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. We will keep you informed of your in-game (in-app) activity, including comments from friends, notifications about in-game (in-app) status as well as notifications of gifts. You may also later opt out of certain of these communications, as further detailed below.
Fun Of Vegas may also use personal and non-personal information, both individually and combined together, to better understand the behavior and preferences of its customers, to identify, suggest and enable communication and connections with other Fun Of Vegas users and personalize our Services to you, to provide technical support and respond to inquiries, to troubleshoot technical problems, to help create a safer and more trusted environment for our players by preventing fraud or potentially illegal activities, to deliver and enforcing our Terms of Service, target and serve static and dynamic advertising, to enforce our Terms of Service, to provide in-game (in-app) leader boards and promote in-game (in-app) player achievements, to solicit input and feedback to improve Fun Of Vegas products and Services and their content, to ensure proper functioning of our products and Services, to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising, to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties and conduct research. In addition, Fun Of Vegas may combine non-personal information with personal information, such as an email address, to administer loyalty programs, tailor its offerings, web pages or game play experience to you. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages ("Promotional Communications") directly or in partnership with parties other than Fun Of Vegas, in accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional Communication will generally offer you choices about receiving additional messages. You can choose to opt out of receiving additional promotional e-mails from Fun Of Vegas by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in any such e-mail, or visiting the e-mail preference page. Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become effective. Note that if you opt-out of our Promotional Communications or other forms of communication, we may still e-mail or communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information or if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons.
We do not actively share personal information with third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent. We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses, MAC Addresses for mobile devices and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Service and on the websites of third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect these and similar types of information within the Service and they may share it with us and/or use it for advertising. Advertisers may collect this information through the use of a variety of tracking technologies, including without limitation, like browser cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). For iOS devices running version 6 or higher, you may limit in-app advertising by adjusting the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting or resetting the “Advertising Identifier” at any time by visiting your device’s “settings” page. When using other operating systems, such as Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft you may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform and/or applications store operator. Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Policy. Fun Of Vegas games or their purchase pages may display an "offer wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These are not offers made by Fun Of Vegas. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Fun Of Vegas or a partnering social network. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your user ID number will be shared with the offer wall provider.
By use of friend finder tools whether directly through the Service or through an social network or gaming service, you acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Service account (and related gaming entitlements, including games played, spins and coins) with your social network profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends’ list will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Some messages, such as invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. The Service supports and may encourage interaction among players. In most Fun Of Vegas games, if you play through a social network or register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. In many Fun Of Vegas games friends and other players will be able to see your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your social network User ID number. Access to your social network User ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related social network or Fun Of Vegas account. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the related social network’s communication channels.
If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion, Fun Of Vegas may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon you granting Fun Of Vegas permission to collect, use, store, transmit and display publicly statistical data, such as your scores, rankings and achievements, generated through your participation.
In all cases of data access and collection, the information you provide will not be disclosed, rented, loaned, leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties and will be used solely for the purpose stated herein. Fun Of Vegas will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services depends on why we collected this information and how we use it. We will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. For instance, we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed your account if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights. If you wish to cancel your account or request that Fun Of Vegas no longer use your information contact Fun Of Vegas at the email address provided in the Contact Us section below. Note that there may be instances where Fun Of Vegas is legally required to retain your information.

We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country and any other information you choose to provide.

If you are unclear about what information a social network is sharing with us, please go to the social networks where you play our games to find out more about their privacy settings.
With your consent we may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide game updates and other relevant messages. You can manage push notifications from the “options” or “settings” page within the relevant game. You may also be able to manage them from your device’s settings page for the relevant game.

Fun Of Vegas may ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to Fun Of Vegas for its own marketing and demographic studies, so that Fun Of Vegas can consistently improve its sites and related advertising to better meet its visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich our understanding of individual customers, Fun Of Vegas may tie this information to the information you provide to us. We direct all such third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to provide services on Fun Of Vegas's behalf.

Cookies
Like many websites, Fun Of Vegas and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store log files and use tracking technologies such as "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of Fun Of Vegas Service, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to use. Third party advertisers on the Services may also use, place or read cookies or other technologies as described below on your browser, and those practices are subject to their own policies. Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting cookies, to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all features, portions or functionalities of the Service.
We and our service providers may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us or our advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and effectively by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times.
We and our service providers use these log files, tags, and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information, including: IP addresses, the type of computer or mobile device you are using, your operating system version, your mobile device’s identifiers, like your MAC Address, Identifier For Advertising (IDFA), and/or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI); your browser types; your browser language; referring and exit pages, and URLs; platform type; the number of clicks on a page or feature; domain names; landing pages; pages viewed and the order of those pages; the amount of time spent on particular pages; and game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games. In some cases, we will connect this information with your social network ID.
Links
The Service may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that Fun Of Vegas endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave the Fun Of Vegas site you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the site or application linked to. These third party websites and applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Because Fun Of Vegas cannot control the activities of third parties, it cannot accept responsibility for the content of these third party services, any use of your personal information by such third parties, and it cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Fun Of Vegas.
