How We Collect Information
We collect personal information about you from the following sources:
Directly from you
.
When you contact us or set up your account, we you may provide us with your contact details and other account information. If you post a comment, make a request, or fill out a survey, we collect that information too. If you apply for a job with us, we gather details related to your employment history.
From your devices.
We use tools like web beacons, cookies and embedded scripts to automatically collect information about you when you visit our websites, use our apps, see our ads, and open our emails. We collect information about you over time and across different devices this way. You can manage what information we collect by checking the “Your Choices” section below.
From third parties
.
If you connect your Flipboard account to another service like Facebook, Twitter, or Google, we receive information from these services. The type of information we get depends on your settings with these services and might include things like your contacts or public posts. If you connect your YouTube account on Flipboard, you agree to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service and also the Google Privacy Policy. Sometimes, we get job-related info from other networks if you use them to apply for a job with us. Friends can also give us your information if they share content with you through Flipboard.
From our vendors and service providers
.
For instance, we may engage with vendors and service providers to collect or provide us with information about you, such as access to location services via wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. Our partners who help with job recruitment, marketing, ads, and analyzing data also provide us with information.
We combine information
.
We sometimes mix the information we get from different places. For example, we might combine information you gave us offline with what we collect online, or mix details we get from a third party with what we already know. We also combine your data with data from other users to spot trends and preferences.
How We Disclose Your Personal Information
All Flipboard accounts may be federated. This means that we may make all public information associated with your account (e.g., your Flipboard profile, comments you post, and content you flip) available not only on Flipboard, but also across the Fediverse – a network of interconnected social media platforms and services that can communicate and interact with each other. It is important to understand that when your data is federated we do not have direct control over how other platforms in the Fediverse handle your data, and their data protection practices may vary. Such platforms may be subject to different terms and policies, and your data may continue to appear on the internet if you have shared it and others have not deleted it. For more information about Flipboard and the Fediverse, please visit our
Help Center
.
We also share your personal information under these circumstances:
With vendors and service providers
.

These vendors and service providers are only permitted to use your personal information in connection with the services provided to us.
With our advertising partners
.
Specifically, we may share Account Information, Inferences, and Device, Internet and Network Activity Information with our advertising partners. Our advertising partners are companies who provide analytics and other advertising support to help us serve the ads you see on the website and app.
To learn about how to control how we share your information with advertising partners see the “Your Choices” section below.
To comply with the law, to protect ourselves, our customers and others, and for safety and security purposes
.
We might share your personal information if we need to for legal reasons. For example, if a law or court order says we have to, or if a government agency asks for it. But remember, this privacy policy doesn’t stop you from defending your rights if someone tries to make us share your information without a good reason. We also might share your information to protect our agreements and rights, or the rights of others. This includes looking into any possible fraud, like cheating in promotions.
In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets in the event of a bankruptcy
.
If our company is involved in a big change like merging with another company, being bought by someone else, or selling part of our business, we might share your personal information in connection with that transaction.
If all or part of our business is bought by another company, your personal information might be part of what is transferred to the new owner.

privacy@flipboard.com

These legitimate interests include to respond to your inquiries and requests for information, maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, mobile applications, ads, and the content and services we offer, detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud, and facilitate the functionality of our websites and mobile applications. In specific situations, we require your personal information to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. We will use legitimate interest after we have properly evaluated the data processing and conducted a necessary balancing test.
When necessary for the performance of a contract

To comply with our legal obligations
. This is our legal basis for certain uses and disclosures of information required by applicable UK and EEA laws. For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting us to law enforcement. Please note that as Flipboard provides a tailored service to each user, it is a requirement of the service that information on your use of the service is collected. If Flipboard is not able to collect such information the service will not be available and you will need to close your Flipboard account.
If you are a resident of the UK or a country in the EEA, you also have the following rights (each of which are subject to various exceptions and limitations):

To ensure adequate protection of personal data in cross-border transfer and/or processing, we use appropriate safeguards as allowed under applicable law or regulation.
10. Links to Third Party Sites
We may link to third-party sites that we do not control. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information practices of those websites.
