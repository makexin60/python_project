WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH?
Players’ personal data are not disclosed, except for the situations specified below:
PARTNERS CONTRACTED BY TEN SQUARE GAMES
Ten Square Games uses the services of its partners. The partners process the Players’ data only at the request and in accordance with the instructions of Ten Square Games to provide the Services. Our partners are marketing agencies and other entities supporting us in our marketing activities, external IT service providers (including the providers of IT systems), entities supporting us in handling correspondence, entities providing us with consulting, advisory and auditing services as well as entities providing us with legal, tax or accounting support, entities providing postal or delivery services, operators of online payment platforms, entities cooperating with us in the field of sales.

The Player shall be notified by e-mail and/or within the Service of any changes in the ownership or changes of persons using the Player’s personal data.
Social features (such as forums or chats) are key elements of our games. When the Players use these features, other players and users may, for instance, see their profile data, in-game activity data and read the Player’s posts. Information shared by the Player also becomes publicly available – this means that not only may we collect and use the information shared by the Player, but also, in some cases, the information may be collected and used by other persons having access to such information without the User’s knowledge. It is entirely up to the Player what she/he shares with other Players. Ten Square Games does not share any Player data with other Players.

TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EEA COUNTRIES
Due to the global nature of our Services and, also, in order to provide the Players with the best experience, the Players’ personal data may be transferred to various countries, including countries outside the European Economic Area („EEA”). As different countries may have different data protection laws than in the Player’s country, we take steps to provide appropriate safeguards to protect the data we were provided with.
Appropriate safeguards include in particular:
decisions of the European Commission stating the appropriate level of protection of personal data in a given country,
standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.
If necessary, in order to increase the security of personal data, we use additional supplementary measures, such as e.g. encryption, to ensure that the transfer of personal data to a country outside the EEA is secure.
We inform you that at any time you have the option to receive a copy of the security measures we use in the form of an appropriate document. For this purpose, please contact us at:

In the event of withdrawal of your consent to the processing of certain data, the User may not be able to use the full functionality of some services or participate in certain activities.

OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA
Providing us with personal data is a condition for concluding a contract for Services. Obviously, you may decide not to provide us with any data, but then you will have no possibility to use your games. Providing us with other personal data may be necessary, e.g. to carry out the payment process in the game – failure to provide them will prevent the purchase.
X.
COLLECTING DATA ABOUT USERS THROUGH INDIRECT MEANS
If the Player creates or logs in to her/his account using a third-party platform and when she/he chooses to link a third-party tool (e.g. Facebook, Messenger or Google), or when she/he uses the Services (in particular, by playing our games) through any third-party applications, we may come into possession of some of the User’s data that will be provided to us by the provider of the aforementioned third-party applications. The information we obtain depends on the Services used by the User (this applies, in particular, to our game played by the Player), the third-party applications used by the User, the User’s privacy settings and, if applicable, the privacy settings of the User’s friends in third-party applications. We may collect and store some or all of the following information from the provider of the third-party application:
name and surname;
profile picture, Player ID (Facebook ID), which may be associated with publicly available user information (profile picture);
the Player’s friends list and other publicly available data;
e-mail address provided in the respective application belonging to a third party;
the Player’s location and the location of the devices on which the User uses our Services;
gender;
age;
information regarding other activities undertaken through or in third-party applications;
other publicly available data made available in applications belonging to third parties.
We also collect the data regarding the Player’s purchases. If the Player makes any payments, our payment partners collect the billing and payment information necessary to process the Player’s fees. These data may include the Player’s mailing address, her/his e-mail address and financial data. Our payment partners do not share the Player’s financial information with us, such as credit card numbers, but they may share with us non-financial data relating to the Player’s purchases, such as name, surname and purchased items.
If the Player plays our games connected with third-party apps or their platforms (such as Facebook, Apple or Google), all purchases made by the Player will be processed by the respective third-party application and will be subject to the terms of service and privacy policy of the respective third party. Ten Square Games does not come into possession of the Player’s financial data related to the above-mentioned purchases, but may obtain access to the Player’s non-financial information related to the purchases made by her/him, such as the Player’s name and surname and the items purchased by her/him. The type of information we receive depends on the game the Player plays and the third-party application.
XI.
PROFILING
When the Player uses our Services, we collect data about her/his interactions with the Website and other players in the game through server logs. In order to display personalized advertisements, tailored to the User’s preferences or needs, ensure the security of our Services and analyze and monitor the use of our Services by the User for such purposes as, for example, improving our games, we may automatically profile and segment all data collected about the User (the information provided by the User may be linked to her/his gamer ID, IP address or device ID). We may also undertake marketing activities related to addressing our personalized offers and benefits to the User. We prepare them by analyzing the User’s data and behavior and, based on them, we undertake activities, e.g. regarding the offer’s content and/or whether to submit a given (special) offer to the User or not. The legal basis for such processing of personal data is the contract for services (execution of the contract) and our legitimate interests.
If the data processing (profiling) is based on our legitimate interests, the User has the right to object to such data processing at any time due to her/his particular situation. In such a case, Ten Square Games is not entitled to process (profile) the User’s data, unless it demonstrates compelling and justified grounds for their processing that override the User’s interests, rights and freedoms, or when the processing is necessary to establish, perform or defend against legal claims.
If we use the User’s data to profile them for direct marketing purposes, the User has the unconditional right to object to such processing at any time. In such a case, the User’s personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes, regardless of our interests, rights and freedoms.
XII.
PUSH NOTIFICATIONS IN OUR GAMES
We may send push notifications to Players through our games in order to inform them about game updates and new records, as well as to send other notifications related to the Services that may be significant to the Players. The Player may at any time resign from receiving such notifications by disabling them on her/his device using the settings.
XIII.
USER DATA SECURITY
In order to help to ensure safe gaming entertainment, we continuously develop and implement administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect the Player’s data from unauthorized access, loss, misuse and alteration.
However, it should be noted that none of these measures guarantee full security of the data provided to us. No server, communications network or data transmission technology over the Internet is 100% secure. Providing us with the data is the User’s decision. In the event such a decision is made, the Player takes the risk of sharing data.
