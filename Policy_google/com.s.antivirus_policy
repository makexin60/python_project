AVG Remote Administration
(collectively as “Antivirus for Desktop”)
Core Functionality
The Antivirus for Desktop provides protection against malicious software by performing key tasks, such as pinpointing specific files for the detection of malwares, scheduling automatic scans, and securing your device against malware.
What are Product’s Main Features
CommunityIQ
is a threat monitoring service for Windows and Mac which sends information about a threat detected in your device to our server, so we can observe how the threat spreads and block it. This is vital for the functioning of our Antivirus and our ability to keep your device secure.
CyberCapture
detects and analyses rare, suspicious files on your Windows. If you attempt to run such a file, CyberCapture locks the file from your PC and sends it to our Threat Lab where it is analysed in a safe, virtual environment. All files are uploaded over an encrypted connection, which means your data is inaccessible to hackers.
File Reputation
provides a real-time comparison with an up-to-date list of malware databases of executable files sourced from users of Windows who agree to participate in the service. FileRep processes files or their hashed versions to evaluate which are infectious and updating virus databases.
Online Security
is a browser plug-in which needs to be specifically activated which checks if the site isn’t malicious or phishing.
Browser Cleanup
is a module inside Antivirus for Desktop (Windows) which inspects the browser extensions of most browsers, tries to identify malicious extensions and offers to remove them. Browser Cleanup is on by default.
Web Shield
scans data that is transferred when you browse the internet in real-time to prevent malware from being downloaded and run on your computer. By default, Web Shield is on and configured to provide optimal protection when switched on.
File Shield
scans programs and files saved on devices for malicious threats in real time before allowing them to be opened, run, modified, or saved.
Email Shield
scans for threats in your incoming and outgoing email messages and attachments. Scanning applies only to messages sent or received using mail management software, such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail or Mozilla Thunderbird.
Hack Alerts
searches and monitors email addresses associated with your Account for data breaches to alert you when your data has been compromised in a breach and your information is exposed on the dark web. This is done in cooperation with our partner SpyCloud which checks your credentials against its repository of stolen accounts. For further information please refer to its privacy policy here.
Sensitive Data Shield
provides an extra layer of protection for your sensitive documents against malware and unauthorized access. It checks your hard drive and looks for files that contain sensitive data. Sensitive Data Shield then helps secure your private data by controlling which applications and users have access to selected files.

AntiTrack
Official Product Name
AVG AntiTrack for Windows
,
AVG AntiTrack for Mac
,
AVG AntiTrack for Android
(collectively as “AntiTrack”)
Core Functionality
As you browse the web, cookies and digital fingerprint-based tracking technologies collect and link information about your activities in order to create profiles of your behavior. This data is then shared, bought and sold by analytics and ad-tech firms. AntiTrack removes cookies and masks the device’s “fingerprint” to prevent third- parties from identifying you and following your behavior across the web.
What are the Product’s Features
AntiFingerprinting
stops scripts from fingerprinting the user’s device and tracking their browsing behavior across the web. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale and AntiTrack version.
Privacy Score
provides the user with an evaluation of how private they are based on various in-app configurations. In particular, this feature relies on processing of  browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale, AntiTrack version, In-app settings (such as features that are turned on/off).
Fingerprint Randomizer
will automatically change the user’s  digital ‘Fingerprint’ in regular intervals, or allow the user to manually change said ‘Fingerprint’. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale and AntiTrack version.
Browser cleanup
helps the user manage browsing history and cookies by allowing the user to manually clear this information  or schedule an automatic deletion at a specific time. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, Cookies, OS version, OS locale, AntiTrack version, In-app settings (such as features that are turned on or off).
Browser protection
helps users stay protected from online tracking attempts
and similar threats
through supported browsers. Any time a suspicious script (tracking attempt) encounters the user’s ‘Fingerprint’, the user is notified. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale, website scripts and tracking elements, and AntiTrack version.
Allowed Websites and whitelisting processes
allows the user to add their favorite websites into the Allowed Websites list so that their stored browser data is not be cleared during the automatic and manual cookie clearing process. Additionally, no anti-tracking measures will be active on these websites once they are added to the Allowed Websites list. In particular, this feature relies on processing of whitelisted websites, browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale and AntiTrack version.
System Privacy
helps stop third parties from seeing, tracking, and collecting customer information from the supported operating system. Specifically, this is related to the customer’s computer login security, protecting files and data on that machine, and keeping the customer’s computer activities private.This provides another layer of security by giving the customer the ability to configure their Privacy Settings within AntiTrack.  In particular this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale, information about operation system’s keys and tasks associated with privacy risks, and AntiTrack version.

Alarm Clock provides an alarm clock for Android devices, using built in system features users can schedule alarms and customize their behavior in many ways.
What are Product’s Features
Alarm Clock
schedules a one time alarm or repeated alarms, customize sound and other behavior while alarms go off and set many other parameters. This feature does not require any special permission, except when a user wants to use a local sound file for their alarms, the app asks to access device storage.
Timer
schedules timers that would go off after desired time is passed. On the technical level timers are just different method of scheduling alarms
Reminders
are a different method of scheduling alarms tailored towards use cases when one needs to remind themselves about something. Unlike regular alarms, reminders can be set with a specific date in the future and the way they go off is more subtle than alarms that are designed to wake users up.
Stopwatch
can measure elapsed time. Stopwatch does not need any special permission to function.
My Day
is a feature that can be optionally brought to the foreground after an alarm is dismissed. My Day is designed to provide useful information to users in the morning. My Day shows weather forecasts and it can be optionally more precise if the user provides permission to determine location from device. My Day also optionally provides information about upcoming events if users agree to access their device calendar.

BreachGuard
Official Product Name
BreachGuard
Core Functionality
Our goal is to enable people to take back their privacy online. Remediate past breaches and minimise the risk of abuse of their data in the future. We aim to provide convenient solutions for everyday life online without sacrificing privacy.
Enabling users to discover and fix online privacy threats.
Prevent data collection by advertising companies and data brokers, depending on region.
Educating users about privacy and security online.
What are Product’s Features
Risk Monitor
is 24/7 dark web monitoring for leaked personal information. BreachGuard leverages the most comprehensive database of the dark web – it detects whether users have been compromised in a breach and their information is exposed on the dark web. If we identify new breaches we alert you based on the email address you submitted. This is done in cooperation with our partner SpyCloud which checks your credentials against its repository of stolen accounts. For further information please refer to its privacy policy
here
. The feature also has the capability, if you consent, to scan your browser for weak, reused or breached passwords and provides instructions to fix these passwords.
Personal info remover
submits opt-out requests to data brokers in North America. This feature processes names (first name, middle name, last name), address (street, city, country, state, zip code), phone number, email and Date of Birth (DOB). The reason for this is that data broker opt-out forms require some of, if not all of the information to submit a valid opt-out request and verify that you are in fact in their database. As a result, we collect this basic information from you to submit the opt-out requests on your behalf.
Privacy Advisor
provides updates and guidance related to online privacy, including but not limited to: recent data breaches and guides to optimize your privacy for social media sites and other common services. If you opt-in, this functionality will process your bookmarks and browsing history to improve the quality of content so we can distinguish guides which are relevant to you (we are not processing full urls but we need only the domain name).
Identity Assist
we have partnered with a third party, Generali Global Assistance, to provide Identity Assist in BreachGuard. The service consists of two sub-features, ScamAssist and Identity Resolution. ScamAssist specialists act as trusted advisors to customers by helping them identify which of the solicitations they have received are potentially fraudulent. Resolution Specialists are available 24/7/365 to educate customers about how identity theft and cyber crimes occur, as well as provide tips and tools to help keep their identity and digital privacy secure. Note we do not process any personal data from your interaction with Generali, Generali does, see its privacy policy here.
Personal Data We Process
By default, BreachGuard processes locally on your system the following data:
Names (first name, middle name, last name), address (street, city, country, state, zip code), phone number, email and date of birth – to send data opt-out requests on your behalf via Personal Info Remover.
Browser credentials (website, username, password) – to scan your browser for weak, reused or breached passwords and provide instructions how to fix
Browsing information (URL) and bookmarks – to highlight relevant privacy guides.

Secure Browser
Secure Browser for Desktop
Official Product Name
AVG Secure Browser
(“Secure Browser for Desktop”)
Core Functionality
Secure Browser for Desktop is a product currently offered for PC Windows and for macOS users
What are Product’s Features
Browser Security & Privacy Center
is built in Security & Privacy Center which is a curated collection of some key security and privacy features, tools and settings, organized into one management console making it easier for you to control and manage your online privacy and security.
WebShield
protects you from accessing dangerous websites, such as fake sites, sites that have harmful programs such as adware, spyware, ransomware, viruses, all types of other malware that aim at stealing your information. It includes https scanning that decrypts and scans encrypted traffic of selected websites to detect potential malware contained on sites using https connections. All scanning occurs locally on your PC during the HTTPS connection, and no one outside of your device can read or decipher the connection.
Privacy Cleaner
cleans all your browser history, all cookies including 3rd party, cached images, and other tracking scripts with just one click, to ensure that your online activity is private as well as free up space on your device.
Privacy Guard
is a built-in extension that helps make your online experience cleaner, faster, safer, and more private. It comprises Adblocker (stops ads from loading), Anti-tracker (blocks tracking scripts and cookies), and Anti-Fingerprint (disguises your browser fingerprint to help prevent websites from tracking you) features all in one. Privacy Guard collects and displays the number of blocked 3rd party calls from external sources.
Sync
means you can sign into the browser using your Avast ID or Google account. Your browsing data (including bookmarks, history, settings, open tabs, passwords, address, phone numbers, and payment information) will be then backed up and available across all your devices. If you sign into the browser using your Avast ID, we receive information that you sync across devices in encrypted form, and we are not able to access it or read it.
Built-in VPN
(virtual private network) that creates an encrypted connection between your device and the internet, securing your browsing data against eavesdroppers, trackers, and hackers. This VPN feature does not track or store connection timestamps, session information, bandwidth usage, traffic data, IP addresses, or other similar data. Using a VPN helps keep you more private and secure but you are still accountable for everything you do online.
Avast Addons Store
is an online store created and maintained by Avast that allows you to view and install a wide range of extensions. On installation of each extension, you will be asked what data you can share with the extension. Extensions are addons that are built to extend the functionality of the browser itself or integrate an existing service with the browser.
Extension Guard
is a built-in extension that helps protect against spammy, fake, or malware browser extensions.
Webcam Guard
helps protect against unauthorized access to your device camera.
Video Downloader
is an extension that allows you to convert and download videos from YouTube and other social media platforms.
HackCheck
see the HackCheck section.
Accuweather widget
– used to display weather information on the new tab page based on the approximate location (derived from the IP address) and device model/OS.
Coupons extension
– used to track and offer coupon codes and deals from online merchants to help you save money. The service is powered by our partner NextGen Shopping, LLC.
Personal Data We Process
By default, Secure Browser for Desktop processes locally on your system the following data:
Browsing history information; for example Secure Browser for Desktop may store the URLs of pages that you visit, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages. If the pre-rendering feature is turned on, a list of IP addresses linked to those pages may also be stored for some period of time;

Personal Data We Process
Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (“Personal Data”).
We may collect data or ask you to provide certain data when you visit our websites, and use our products and services. The sources from which we collect Personal Data include:
Data collected directly from you or your device relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”), and may include direct identifiers such as name, postal and email address, phone number, and online or indirect identifiers such as login account, login password, marketing preferences, social media account, and/or IP address;
If we link other data with your Personal Data, we will treat that linked data as Personal Data; and
We may also collect Personal Data from trusted third-party sources such as service providers, distributors, resellers, app stores, contact centers, and engage third parties such as marketing, survey, analytics or software suppliers to collect Personal Data to assist us.
We do not process special categories of personal data, such as data concerning health, race, ethnicity or political opinions, or deduce in any way this type of information from data we collect within our products.
We organize the Personal Data we process into these basic categories: Billing Data, Account Data, Product Data and Communications Data.
Billing Data
The below described billing process applies to all customers who have purchased our products and/or standalone features through our Gen eStore. This information is used to bill those customers for the purchased services and products. Our parent company, Gen Digital Inc., will act as a controller with respect to processing of the Billing Data.
Billing data includes your name, email address, billing address, your phone number, payment information (depending on method can include Credit/Debit Card Information or PayPal account), National ID (regional specific, if outside the United States), VAT/Tax ID (regional specific, if outside the United States) and device fingerprint ID.
Billing data
What we use it for
Email address
To send you purchase receipts
Name and Billing address
To maintain billing records
Payment information – payment card info, for businesses only VAT/Tax ID and Business ID
To process the payment and billing records
Identifiers – product and license keys/numbers, Wallet ID, Auto bill ID, Payment transaction ID
To identify the product and enable features based on the purchased license and to track account activity between internal company systems, applications, and architecture. This data is also processed for the purpose of delivering the product in accordance with your device(s) as well as for trade compliance and fraud check.
Renewability
To check if a given subscription can be renewed under the same or similar terms
Expiration date
To check whether a license is current
Device fingerprint ID
To validate that an authenticated payment transaction occurred, and the payment card and account are appropriate for billing.
IP address
To facilitate the enrollment and purchases and detect and prevent fraud.
Relevant subsets of Billing data are kept for 7 years for the purpose of complying with our legal obligations (particularly in the finance and tax area) and defending our rights.
In certain cases, you purchase our products and services from a trusted third-party service provider, reseller, or app store. In those circumstances, your Billing Data is processed by the relevant third party and we only receive a subset of this data to keep proper business records. In particular, we only have a masked credit/debit card number, not your full payment details.
Account Data
Account Data includes information to set up and customize an account, such as your name, email address and username, and information connected with our services, such as product, license and device information. For some of our products or some of their functions creating an account is necessary. Account Data is also used for customer management and engagement, revenue generation, and evaluation and optimization of operational, sales and business processes.
See below an example of Account Data and what we use it for:
Account data
What we use it for
Name
To customize our communications by addressing you by your name
Email address
To send you communications regarding your license and support and to offer our other products and services
Username

Account usage data (events such as request to end subscription, subscription-related information)
To enable premium features activation, provide tailored life-cycle experience and communication with customer support, suitable product interface content.
Subscription renewal date

In the Forum profile
, you have the option to provide additional information within your account such as your name, email address, social media information, birth date, gender, instant messaging information, or website name and address, your physical location, and an avatar or personalized picture. We use Discourse for hosting the Forum.
To register with us or to be able to log in later on our pages or in our products, we offer you, in addition to our own procedure, the option to do this via the services Facebook Connect, Google, and Apple ID. For this purpose, we will redirect you to a page of the corresponding provider. Data from the provider (email, platform ID, optionally name) is then provided to create the account.
The customer account remains valid until you actively delete it in the user administration section of the account. You can also contact our support or DPO in case you would like to delete your account.
Product Data
Product Data includes two sub-categories:
Device Data
includes information about the operating system; hardware; city/country location of device; IP address, device error logs; browser; network; applications running on the device, including the Avast products; and
Service Data
includes information about product usage and events relating to use of our product by you. This information includes security data (samples and detection details such as information concerning URLs of websites, texts, emails and files used for malware and scam protection), usage statistics (activation, crashes, scans, errors), information related to product licenses, support-related data and our internal identifiers associated with our services (e.g. installation ID, internal hardware ID).
These sub-categories differ for each product and service. If you want more detail about Device and Service Data we process on a product basis, please refer to our
Products Policy
.
Communications Data
If you contact us directly, request information or provide reviews and feedback, we collect personal data about you, including identifiers, such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of any message or attachments that you may send or communicate to us, and any other information you choose to provide. We may retain and review audio, electronic, visual, or similar information, such as audio call and chat recordings and/or the contents of the messages as required/permitted by law and our recording and information management policies. We will also collect identifiers from you, such as your email address and phone number, when you sign up to receive product updates, offers, and other promotional information or messages from us. When we send you emails, we may track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve our services.
Why We Process Your Personal Data

We may also share threat intelligence with other security companies and experts to improve our threat detection models;
To make our systems and applications more secure including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks;
To record our phone conversation when you contact our tech support by phone to better respond to your requests.

To establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights.
Your interests are a key part of our decision-making process and have been considered in all of the above-mentioned processing activities. We believe we have achieved a fair balance between privacy and business operations. In any case, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to those processing operations. For more details please see section
Your Privacy Rights
.
The list is, however, not exhaustive and depending on the business and legal developments we may process data for other compatible purposes as applicable in accordance with relevant privacy regulations.
Balancing Legitimate Interests
Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough. With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail.
Security and Threat Intelligence
We process Personal Data to support network and information security efforts. In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data in a proportionate manner for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. This covers the ability of our networks or of our information systems to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the data we store or transmit, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.
Moreover, as a member of the security community, we also cooperate with other players across the security landscape, in particular by exchanging threat intelligence resources, and aid in research and development of new security solutions.
The Personal Data we process for the purpose listed above includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:
Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);
Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including phishing);
Email header detail including addresses and intermediary systems (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);
Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files);
Samples (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files);
Samples behavior (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful files);
URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful content); and/or
IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful content).
Product messaging - In-product and Email Messages
We have a legitimate interest in messaging our users about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and about products that supplement or improve the products already purchased. We can also message our customers with information and offers relating to already purchased products (e.g. time-limited offers).
If you are our customer, we feel a responsibility to inform you about security and utility improvements and possible problems to your device and software, and provide you with effective solutions relevant to these problems. Because of this, we have a legitimate interest to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication to you so that you are likely to find them relevant and non-intrusive at the same time. We use certain limited subsets of Billing Data, Account Data, and Product Data to deliver this communication.
Product and business improvement
We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data to understand user conversions, acquisitions and campaign performance through various distribution channels, and users’ download, activation and interactions with our products. For example, we want to know how many users clicked on our offers, or purchased our product after seeing one of our ads. These analytics help us improve functionality, effectiveness, security and reliability of our products and business activities as well as helping us to develop new products. This processing includes using third-party tools. Please refer to our
Products Policy
for the list of third-party tools used for the specific products and services.
How We Process Your Personal Data
We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the Personal Data that we use:
For free versions, this disconnection or removal of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially activated. For paid users we keep Billing Data in a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than handling payments and our own financial management activities.
For both paid and free versions, we continuously monitor for, minimize, disconnect and remove all direct identifiers during the normal performance of the products and services.
Processing of IP Addresses
Your IP address is collected at the time at which your product or service is being provided for the purpose of downloading and installing the products, product authorization, fraud and malware detection and for the purpose of facilitating our billing process. In particular for delivering the content in accordance with your device(s) settings, determining appropriate language settings for communicating with you, troubleshooting issues, and generating appropriate diagnostics reports.
Please refer to our
Products Policy
for specific use of IP address by our products and services.
Personalization
We use relevant Billing Data, Account Data, Product Data and your answers from surveys, in which you can participate, to personalize our offers, communication and product recommendations.
We do not take any decisions solely based on algorithms, including profiling, that would significantly affect you.
How We Disclose Your Personal Data
We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within our group of companies, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, when required by applicable law. Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and the relevant
Products Policy
sections. If we disclose your Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.
We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer. Data obtained through short code programs will not be shared with any third-parties for their marketing reasons/purposes.
Payment processors
In certain cases, we may use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are properly regulated and authorized to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes other than arranging these services for us. However, they are independent controllers of your data with their own responsibility.
These are our long-term payment processors:

Service Providers
We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and
Products Policy
. We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential.
Such service providers may include contact centers, professional consultants (including to defend or to exercise our rights), and marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers.  We may also connect with business partners to provide specific services to you such as identity restoration. To provide identity restoration services, we may share, at your direction, your data with financial institutions, financial services companies, and other authorized third parties.
We use Salesforce to provide us the CRM platform (see their
privacy information
including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers).
We use Qualtrics as the provider of the experience management platform used to collect and evaluate customer feedback and insights (see their
privacy information
including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
We use Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc., for hosting our Forum (see their
privacy information
).
Sometimes these service providers, for example our distributors, resellers, and app store partners will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”) and privacy statements will apply to such relationships.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Advertising Companies
To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve third-party ads in our products for mobile devices. To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product. The SDK collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you.
Only few of our free products serve third-party ads. You will be asked for consent during the installation process of any such product. For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our
Consent Policy
which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy.
We may share limited categories of personal data (online identifiers and product-related information used to display appropriate ads) with these third parties for cross-contextual advertising purposes, as defined under California and other applicable U.S. state laws. “Cross-contextual advertising” in this context means advertisements we believe will be more interesting and useful to you based on your data, including data related to the use of our Services. Third parties may use the data we’ve shared with them to show you personalized ads.  No data is sold to these third parties.
Distributors, Resellers
We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of distribution, sale or management of our products. Our partners may communicate with you about Avast products or services. In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Cookies Providers
Our websites use cookies to personalize your experience on our sites, to tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and to give us insights into user interactions and user base as a whole so we can improve our communications and products. While using our websites, you will be asked to authorize the collection and use of data by cookies according to the terms of the
Cookie Policy

Analytics Tool Providers

We use Service and Device data for analytics.
While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise. Below, we list these partners and tools and their privacy policies.

Public Authorities
In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law. No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to:
A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;
A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process;
Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or
A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings
Like any other consumer brand, we too go through our own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Our business decisions and market developments therefore affect our structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate.
If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable. Information including personal data relating to our business may be shared with other parties in order to evaluate and conclude the transaction. This would also be the case if we were required by law to make such changes.
Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Group Entities and to Third-Party Vendors
We are a global business that provides products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data processed.
The intra-group transfers within the Gen Digital Group are covered by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. Check
here
to access the Gen Digital Inc. Data Privacy Framework Notice.
At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data originating from the EEA outside of the EEA or cooperate with a third-party vendor located outside the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate safeguards, such as
Standard Contractual Clauses
or
adequacy decisions
adopted by the European Commission, to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.
Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include: allowing access to Personal Data stored in the Google Cloud Platform to Google personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the
Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings
section).
How We Protect Your Personal Data
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data.
Administrative Safeguards
Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave the company. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.
Technical Safeguards
We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize technical safeguards such as up-to-date
firewall
protection for an additional layer of security, high-quality anti-virus software, and we regularly update our
virus
definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to adopt appropriate measures if we deem them necessary.
Physical Safeguards
Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.
Proportionality
We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.
Children’s Privacy
Our websites, services and products are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect data from, minors (as defined by applicable law) except where explicitly described otherwise in the privacy notices of services designed specifically for purposes, such as to assist you by providing child online protection features. In such cases, we will only collect and process Personal Data related to any child under the age specified in particular jurisdictions, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process. Details about this processing is included in our
Products Policy
. Please refer to the specific applicable notices for this information.
How Long We Store Your Personal Data
We keep your personal data as long as we need it to provide you with our services, to comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s legitimate interests (such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products; to defend against legal claims, complaints, litigation or regulatory proceedings). Often, there are different reasons to keep a specific piece of information that overlap and influence each other.
When determining the specific retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of service provided to you, the nature of our relationship with you, and mandatory retention periods provided by law and the relevant statute of limitations.
More specifically, we will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the following periods:
For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights and keeping proper business records. So, if we take payments from you, we archive limited payment information related to transactions for the time specified in law (depending on the relevant jurisdiction) to maintain proper business records, meet our audit obligations, detect and prevent fraud and to protect our legal rights in case there are disputes. We also keep your Billing data to enable the renewal of your subscriptions;
For Account Data, for as long as you maintain your account;
For Product Data, only as long as necessary for the purposes of a particular product or service. Where possible, we use rolling deletion periods which means we regularly delete collected data in the given periods starting from the collection of that respective data. The rolling deletion periods for Product Data are not longer than six years. You can find specific rolling deletion periods for each of our products and their purposes in our
Products Policy
. Please note that when you uninstall our product, processing for service provision, in-product messaging, analytics and third-party ads, if applicable, dependent on the installed product shall cease. After the uninstallation, we will continue to process your Product Data for statistical purposes for up to six years. We have measures in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws, including pseudonymization.
For Communications Data, for as long as necessary to resolve your requests or questions and maintain evidence of such communications to defend our rights and protect our interests. If you receive product updates, offers, and other promotional information or messages, we process the data until you unsubscribe.
Storage of Your Personal Data
We are a global company that processes personal data in many countries. As part of our business, we may transfer data across the Gen group, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and third-party vendors of Gen located worldwide, including Avast, Avira, LifeLock and Norton entities. Data can be located in places where we offer our products or have our offices, infrastructure or data centers, including Europe and the United States.
Transfers of your personal data within Gen Digital and its subsidiaries and affiliates are done pursuant to our intra-group data transfer agreement including EU Commission-approved

Before we transfer data to third parties, we look at the risks to the data associated with such transfer. We require third parties to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly. For data originating from the European Economic Area we rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
.
Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA may also include: allowing access to personal data stored in the cloud (such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform) to personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services.
In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
Your Privacy Rights
There are a variety of data protection laws around the globe that provide privacy rights to you as our customer. You can make certain choices about how your data is used by us by adjusting the privacy settings of the relevant product.
Besides that, you have the following rights (depending on the region):
Right to information - Right to receive information about the processing of your Personal Data, prior to processing as well as during the processing, upon request. In particular, but not limited to:
categories of personal data collected, sold, or disclosed by us;
purposes for which categories of personal data are collected or sold;
categories of sources from which we collect personal data;
categories of third parties to whom we disclosed or sold personal data; and
specific pieces of personal data we have collected about you during the past twelve months.
Right of access - You have the right to receive a copy of your Personal Data.
Right to rectification - You have the right to seek correction of inaccurate Personal Data.
Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") - You have the right to erasure of your Personal Data, but only in specific cases stipulated by law, e.g., if there is no legally recognized title on our part for further processing of your Personal Data (incl. protection of our legitimate interests and rights).
Right to data portability - The right to receive Personal Data which you have provided and is being processed on the basis of consent or where it is necessary for the purpose of conclusion and performance of a contract, in machine-readable format. This right applies exclusively to Personal Data where processing is carried out by automated means.
Right to object - Applies to cases of processing carried out in legitimate interest. You have the right to object to such processing, on grounds relating to your particular situation, and we are required to assess the processing in order to ensure compliance with all legally binding rules and applicable regulations. In case of direct marketing, we shall cease processing Personal Data for such purposes after the objection.
Right to withdraw consent - In the case of processing based on your consent, as specified in our
Consent Policy
, you can withdraw your consent at any time by using the same method (if technically possible) you used to provide it to us (the exact method will be described in more detail with each consent when you provide it). The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.
Right to restriction of processing - You have the right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data if: You are contesting the accuracy of your Personal Data, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of your Personal Data; the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the Personal Data and request the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or you have objected to processing of your Personal Data, and there is a pending verification whether our legitimate grounds override your interests.
Right to Equal Service - Right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights, subject to certain limitations.
Right to contact a supervisory authority or court - You may contact and lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority – The Office for Personal Data Protection (Czech: Úřad na ochranu osobních údajů – www.uoou.cz) or your local authority or a relevant court.
You can submit your requests relating to your data subject rights and access to documentation relating to appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers through our online form:
https://support.avg.com/support_dsr
.
The fulfillment of data subject rights listed above will depend on the category of Personal Data and the processing activity. In all cases, we strive to fulfill your request.
We will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a Data Subject. When we are faced with an unusually large number of requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months. If we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to resolve the situation informally.
Where requests we receive are unfounded or excessive, in particular because they repeat, we may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request.
Identification of an individual may not be necessary for some of our free products to be delivered to you or to function. In this case, we do not and will not maintain, acquire or process additional information solely in order to identify the users of our free products and services.
Consistent with our privacy by design, privacy by default and data minimization practices, we may not be able to identify you in connection with Product Data relating to specific free products and services. However, you can go directly to your product settings and explore the available privacy options.

AVG Remote Administration
(collectively as “Antivirus for Desktop”)
Core Functionality
The Antivirus for Desktop provides protection against malicious software by performing key tasks, such as pinpointing specific files for the detection of malwares, scheduling automatic scans, and securing your device against malware.
What are Product’s Main Features
CommunityIQ
is a threat monitoring service for Windows and Mac which sends information about a threat detected in your device to our server, so we can observe how the threat spreads and block it. This is vital for the functioning of our Antivirus and our ability to keep your device secure.
CyberCapture
detects and analyses rare, suspicious files on your Windows. If you attempt to run such a file, CyberCapture locks the file from your PC and sends it to our Threat Lab where it is analysed in a safe, virtual environment. All files are uploaded over an encrypted connection, which means your data is inaccessible to hackers.
File Reputation
provides a real-time comparison with an up-to-date list of malware databases of executable files sourced from users of Windows who agree to participate in the service. FileRep processes files or their hashed versions to evaluate which are infectious and updating virus databases.
Online Security
is a browser plug-in which needs to be specifically activated which checks if the site isn’t malicious or phishing.
Browser Cleanup
is a module inside Antivirus for Desktop (Windows) which inspects the browser extensions of most browsers, tries to identify malicious extensions and offers to remove them. Browser Cleanup is on by default.
Web Shield
scans data that is transferred when you browse the internet in real-time to prevent malware from being downloaded and run on your computer. By default, Web Shield is on and configured to provide optimal protection when switched on.
File Shield
scans programs and files saved on devices for malicious threats in real time before allowing them to be opened, run, modified, or saved.
Email Shield
scans for threats in your incoming and outgoing email messages and attachments. Scanning applies only to messages sent or received using mail management software, such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail or Mozilla Thunderbird.
Hack Alerts
searches and monitors email addresses associated with your Account for data breaches to alert you when your data has been compromised in a breach and your information is exposed on the dark web. This is done in cooperation with our partner SpyCloud which checks your credentials against its repository of stolen accounts. For further information please refer to its privacy policy here.
Sensitive Data Shield
provides an extra layer of protection for your sensitive documents against malware and unauthorized access. It checks your hard drive and looks for files that contain sensitive data. Sensitive Data Shield then helps secure your private data by controlling which applications and users have access to selected files.

AntiTrack
Official Product Name
AVG AntiTrack for Windows
,
AVG AntiTrack for Mac
,
AVG AntiTrack for Android
(collectively as “AntiTrack”)
Core Functionality
As you browse the web, cookies and digital fingerprint-based tracking technologies collect and link information about your activities in order to create profiles of your behavior. This data is then shared, bought and sold by analytics and ad-tech firms. AntiTrack removes cookies and masks the device’s “fingerprint” to prevent third- parties from identifying you and following your behavior across the web.
What are the Product’s Features
AntiFingerprinting
stops scripts from fingerprinting the user’s device and tracking their browsing behavior across the web. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale and AntiTrack version.
Privacy Score
provides the user with an evaluation of how private they are based on various in-app configurations. In particular, this feature relies on processing of  browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale, AntiTrack version, In-app settings (such as features that are turned on/off).
Fingerprint Randomizer
will automatically change the user’s  digital ‘Fingerprint’ in regular intervals, or allow the user to manually change said ‘Fingerprint’. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale and AntiTrack version.
Browser cleanup
helps the user manage browsing history and cookies by allowing the user to manually clear this information  or schedule an automatic deletion at a specific time. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, Cookies, OS version, OS locale, AntiTrack version, In-app settings (such as features that are turned on or off).
Browser protection
helps users stay protected from online tracking attempts
and similar threats
through supported browsers. Any time a suspicious script (tracking attempt) encounters the user’s ‘Fingerprint’, the user is notified. In particular, this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale, website scripts and tracking elements, and AntiTrack version.
Allowed Websites and whitelisting processes
allows the user to add their favorite websites into the Allowed Websites list so that their stored browser data is not be cleared during the automatic and manual cookie clearing process. Additionally, no anti-tracking measures will be active on these websites once they are added to the Allowed Websites list. In particular, this feature relies on processing of whitelisted websites, browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale and AntiTrack version.
System Privacy
helps stop third parties from seeing, tracking, and collecting customer information from the supported operating system. Specifically, this is related to the customer’s computer login security, protecting files and data on that machine, and keeping the customer’s computer activities private.This provides another layer of security by giving the customer the ability to configure their Privacy Settings within AntiTrack.  In particular this feature relies on processing of browser version, hardware data, OS version, OS locale, information about operation system’s keys and tasks associated with privacy risks, and AntiTrack version.

BreachGuard
Official Product Name
BreachGuard
Core Functionality
Our goal is to enable people to take back their privacy online. Remediate past breaches and minimise the risk of abuse of their data in the future. We aim to provide convenient solutions for everyday life online without sacrificing privacy.
Enabling users to discover and fix online privacy threats.
Prevent data collection by advertising companies and data brokers, depending on region.
Educating users about privacy and security online.
What are Product’s Features
Risk Monitor
is 24/7 dark web monitoring for leaked personal information. BreachGuard leverages the most comprehensive database of the dark web – it detects whether users have been compromised in a breach and their information is exposed on the dark web. If we identify new breaches we alert you based on the email address you submitted. This is done in cooperation with our partner SpyCloud which checks your credentials against its repository of stolen accounts. For further information please refer to its privacy policy
here
. The feature also has the capability, if you consent, to scan your browser for weak, reused or breached passwords and provides instructions to fix these passwords.
Personal info remover
submits opt-out requests to data brokers in North America. This feature processes names (first name, middle name, last name), address (street, city, country, state, zip code), phone number, email and Date of Birth (DOB). The reason for this is that data broker opt-out forms require some of, if not all of the information to submit a valid opt-out request and verify that you are in fact in their database. As a result, we collect this basic information from you to submit the opt-out requests on your behalf.
Privacy Advisor
provides updates and guidance related to online privacy, including but not limited to: recent data breaches and guides to optimize your privacy for social media sites and other common services. If you opt-in, this functionality will process your bookmarks and browsing history to improve the quality of content so we can distinguish guides which are relevant to you (we are not processing full urls but we need only the domain name).
Identity Assist
we have partnered with a third party, Generali Global Assistance, to provide Identity Assist in BreachGuard. The service consists of two sub-features, ScamAssist and Identity Resolution. ScamAssist specialists act as trusted advisors to customers by helping them identify which of the solicitations they have received are potentially fraudulent. Resolution Specialists are available 24/7/365 to educate customers about how identity theft and cyber crimes occur, as well as provide tips and tools to help keep their identity and digital privacy secure. Note we do not process any personal data from your interaction with Generali, Generali does, see its privacy policy here.
Personal Data We Process
By default, BreachGuard processes locally on your system the following data:
Names (first name, middle name, last name), address (street, city, country, state, zip code), phone number, email and date of birth – to send data opt-out requests on your behalf via Personal Info Remover.
Browser credentials (website, username, password) – to scan your browser for weak, reused or breached passwords and provide instructions how to fix
Browsing information (URL) and bookmarks – to highlight relevant privacy guides.
This data is not sent to our environment.

What are Product’s Features
Browser Security & Privacy Center
is built in Security & Privacy Center which is a curated collection of some key security and privacy features, tools and settings, organized into one management console making it easier for you to control and manage your online privacy and security.
WebShield
protects you from accessing dangerous websites, such as fake sites, sites that have harmful programs such as adware, spyware, ransomware, viruses, all types of other malware that aim at stealing your information. It includes https scanning that decrypts and scans encrypted traffic of selected websites to detect potential malware contained on sites using https connections. All scanning occurs locally on your PC during the HTTPS connection, and no one outside of your device can read or decipher the connection.
Privacy Cleaner
cleans all your browser history, all cookies including 3rd party, cached images, and other tracking scripts with just one click, to ensure that your online activity is private as well as free up space on your device.
Privacy Guard

It comprises Adblocker (stops ads from loading), Anti-tracker (blocks tracking scripts and cookies), and Anti-Fingerprint (disguises your browser fingerprint to help prevent websites from tracking you) features all in one. Privacy Guard collects and displays the number of blocked 3rd party calls from external sources.
Sync
means you can sign into the browser using your Avast ID or Google account. Your browsing data (including bookmarks, history, settings, open tabs, passwords, address, phone numbers, and payment information) will be then backed up and available across all your devices. If you sign into the browser using your Avast ID, we receive information that you sync across devices in encrypted form, and we are not able to access it or read it.
Built-in VPN

This VPN feature does not track or store connection timestamps, session information, bandwidth usage, traffic data, IP addresses, or other similar data. Using a VPN helps keep you more private and secure but you are still accountable for everything you do online.
Avast Addons Store
is an online store created and maintained by Avast that allows you to view and install a wide range of extensions. On installation of each extension, you will be asked what data you can share with the extension.

PRIVACY STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION.
Infrascale, Inc. (“Infrascale,” “we,” “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy describes Infrascale’s privacy practices and procedures relating to the Backup Data and Service Data Infrascale collects and processes in connection with our website, the data backup and disaster recovery services and products we provide, and our related business practices (collectively referred to as the “Products”).  Where we refer to our customers in this Privacy Policy, we also mean our partners and their customers.
“Backup Data” refers to the data processed, stored, and/or hosted by our customers using Infrascale Products for data backup and/or disaster recovery purposes.
“Service Data” refers to the personal information we collect or generate during the provision and administration of the Infrascale Products, excluding any Backup Data.  “Service Data” also includes the personal information we collect in connection with (i) our website, (ii) offline collection methods such as Infrascale events, surveys, questionnaires, and the like, (iii) third-party sources, including business partners, ad networks, vendors, and other third-party sources, and (iv) your communications with us, including without limitation as a website visitor, customer, vendor, or prospective employment candidate.
This Privacy Policy summarizes the types of information we collect, how we process it, the circumstances in which we will disclose it, how we safeguard it, gaining access to it, updating or correcting it, and resolving disputes relating to Infrascale’s privacy practices concerning it.
INFORMATION INFRASCALE COLLECTS OR PROCESSES.
Infrascale provides its customers with data backup and disaster recovery solutions that include hardware, software, and cloud-hosted functionality. Our Products help customers maintain business continuity (via backup and disaster recovery) while actively managing the efficiency of data storage. Infrascale Products are, generally, software-as-a-service solutions tied to Infrascale-hosted cloud facilities.  Some are sold as software-only and work on private or public cloud resources.
Infrascale collects and/or processes two categories of information:
Backup Data.
Infrascale processes Backup Data provided by or on behalf of our customers when using Infrascale Products for the purpose of delivering data backup and/or disaster recovery services and functionality to our customers.  If a customer is using Infrascale’s cloud, Infrascale stores and hosts this Backup Data.
Service Data.
Infrascale collects Service Data through our interactions with you and through the Infrascale Products. You provide some of this Service Data directly and we obtain some from other sources, including by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our Products.  Service Data includes:
Your communications with us.
Infrascale maintains records of your communications and interactions with us, including your contact information. Your interactions may include account and Product-related communications, web forms you submit to us, online chats with our support representatives, and inquiries or submissions regarding employment opportunities. We also collect and maintain information for processing payments for our Products and we keep reasonable business records related to billing and payments.
Technical and Operational Details.
We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of and interaction with our Products and your opening of emails or clicking on links in emails from us. Like many websites, we use “cookies” and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser or device accesses our Products. Examples of the type of information we automatically collect include Internet protocol (IP) address, device and computer/browser information, the location of your device or computer, and identifiers and information contained in cookies. See Section 3 for more information on cookies.
Information from Other Sources.
We might receive information about you from other sources, including service providers, partners, third-party databases, and publicly available sources. Examples of information we receive from other sources include: marketing, sales demand generation, and recruitment information, including your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and other contact information; credit history information from credit bureaus; and subscription, support, or other information regarding your use of and interactions with our Products.
COOKIES.
Our website uses cookies and other standard web technology (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize your browser or device, learn more about your interests, enable our Products to work, recognize you when you sign in to use the Products, conduct research and diagnostics to improve our offerings, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security, and keep track of your preferences (such as your language and configuration preferences).
A “Cookie” is a small data file that we store on your computer. We may use session Cookies (which expire once you close your browser) or persistent Cookies (which remain on your computer for an extended period). We set a persistent Cookie on your computer if you choose “remember me”, so you don’t have to log in to the website each time you visit. In addition, our Products may cause or allow Cookies from third party sites or applications to be saved on your browser or device. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third-party Cookies because we do not have any control over them. Finally, we may partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites or to analyze the use of our Products. More specifically, we may use Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or other providers to place advertisements on different sites across the Internet or to provide analytical data on how you and other users are using our Products. Such third parties may use technologies such as Cookies to gather such information on the other sites you visit to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests as well as to inform us about how, how often, and to what extent the Products are being used. Our Privacy Policy does not address these third-party Cookies designed for advertising and analytics.
Most web browsers accept Cookies by default but allow users to reject Cookies by changing the browser preferences. If you have set up your browser to reject all Cookies, our Products will not work properly.
Our emails to you use email beacons or tracking pixels. Email beacons and tracking pixels are small electronic images that tell us if an email has been opened and acted upon.
INFRASCALE’S ROLE AS A DATA PROCESSOR.
If a customer uploads Backup Data containing Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) to Infrascale’s Products, it is the customer that is the data controller with respect to such Personally Identifiable Information. That is, the customer has the direct contact with the individuals whose Personally Identifiable Information was uploaded to the applicable Product.  Customers, as opposed to Infrascale, collect the Personally Identifiable Information from their customers, personnel, or other data subjects. For purposes of this policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.
We may process any Personally Identifiable Information contained within the Backup Data, among other Backup Data, when customers use the Products for data backup and/or disaster recovery purposes. When providing the Products, Infrascale processes Backup Data strictly in accordance with the actions or instructions of the applicable customer or as required by law.
As a data processor, with certain exceptions, Infrascale may have an obligation under its agreement with the customer not to disclose or otherwise transfer Backup Data to a third party except to provide the Products or pursuant to the customer’s instructions to us to disclose or transfer such information. Except as set forth herein, Infrascale processes Backup Data solely for the purpose of providing Products to customers.  Infrascale may use third party data processors to assist it in providing the Products to its customers.
USE OF BACKUP DATA AND SERVICE DATA.
We use your Backup Data and Service Data for lawful purposes to operate, provide, develop, and/or improve our Products while also respecting your privacy.
Backup Data
.
We process Backup Data provided by or on behalf of our customers for the purpose of providing data backup and/or disaster recovery services and functionality to our customers.  Our systems process Backup Data to perform these functions based on the actions and instructions of our customers.  If a customer is using Infrascale’s cloud, Infrascale also stores and hosts the Backup Data.
Service Data
.
We use your Service Data to operate, provide, develop, and improve Infrascale Products.  Our purposes for using Service Data include:
Communicate with You.
We use your Service Data to communicate with you regarding Infrascale Products, including via email, online chat, and phone, to provide assistance to assist you, and in the case of employment candidates, to communicate regarding possible employment opportunities at Infrascale.

Maintain and Improve Infrascale Products.

Personalization.
We use your Service Data to personalize your experience with our website and Products and to identify your preferences.
Comply with Legal Obligations or Satisfy Requirements.
In certain circumstances, we may be legally required to collect, use, disclose, or retain your Service Data when we’re responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request, or to meet our regulatory, legal, insurance, or financial record-keeping obligations.
Marketing.
We use your Service Data to market and promote Infrascale Products, provide you with ongoing news, publications, and information, better tailor our marketing activities, and implement and maintain loyalty programs.
Fraud and Abuse Prevention.
We use your Service Data to detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, abuse, and technical issues and to protect the security of Infrascale, our users, and others.
With Your Consent or as Required or Permitted by Law.
We may ask for your consent to use your Service Data for other purposes not covered in this Privacy Policy. We may also use your Service Data as required or permitted by law.
HOW INFRASCALE SHARES BACKUP DATA AND SERVICE DATA.
We do not sell or rent Backup Data or Service Data to anyone. Nonetheless, we may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of Infrascale’s assets in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets of our business, or in the event of bankruptcy.  These assets may include Backup Data or Service Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
Service Data may be disclosed to (i) our employees, agents, representatives, advisors, affiliates, and independent contractors, in connection with their performance of services for or on behalf of our customers or website visitors, and (ii) service providers who perform functions on our behalf or provide services to us in connection with our business operations, sales and marketing, information technology, or professional services.  The individuals and entities described in (i) and (ii) above have access to Service Data needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to use it for other purposes.
We may disclose Backup Data or Service Data when required by a subpoena, court order, search warrant, other legal process, legally binding requests by law enforcement agencies, lawful requests by any other public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or applicable law. Moreover, we may disclose Service Data to the extent necessary to maintain the security of our websites or Products; resolve disputes; enforce or apply our
Terms of Use
and other agreements; protect the rights, property or safety of Infrascale, our users, or others, or investigate possible misconduct.
Other than as described above, you will receive notice when Service Data about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose whether to share the information.
THIRD PARTY HOSTING OF BACKUP DATA AND SERVICE DATA.
We use certain third-party service providers to host and maintain Backup Data that we may receive from you. For example, we may use Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and other cloud platform providers to host the Infrascale cloud solutions and to collect and maintain Backup Data processed by our Products.  In addition, we upload certain account-related Service Data to third party service providers to maintain and analyze information about our relationships with our customers and others, undertake Infrascale marketing campaigns, facilitate sales-related activities, and provide customer and technical support.
We enter into agreements with third parties hosting Backup Data and Service Data. These agreements bind such third parties to confidentiality restrictions requiring them to use Backup Data and Service Data only for purposes of delivering their services to us, not to disclose Backup Data without authorization, and to adhere to the kinds of privacy practices summarized in this Privacy Policy.
THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES.
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the policies and practices of third parties or other organizations that are not operating on our behalf, including policies and practices related to privacy and security, data collection, processing, use, storage, and disclosure. This includes any third party operating any site or service to which our Products link. Infrascale’s provision of a link to a third- party website or service does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us.
HOW INFRASCALE SAFEGUARDS BACKUP DATA AND SERVICE DATA.
We work hard to protect you and Infrascale from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, which includes the following practices:
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and use of Backup Data and Service Data.
We restrict access to Backup Data to authorized Infrascale employees, independent contractors, and service providers who perform functions on our behalf or provide services to us in connection with our business operations, information technology, or professional services. The individuals to whom access is granted are required to keep that information confidential and not use it for any other purpose.
We restrict access to Service Data to authorized Infrascale employees, agents, representatives, advisors, affiliates, independent contractors, and service providers who perform functions on our behalf or provide services to us in connection with our business operations, sales and marketing, information technology, or professional services. The individuals to whom access is granted are required to keep that information confidential and not use it for any other purpose.
We use third party providers for credit card transactions who follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose Service Data to you.
However, no security procedures or protocols are ever guaranteed to be 100% secure and so we encourage you to take care when disclosing Service Data online and to use readily available tools, such as Internet firewalls, anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and similar technologies to protect yourself online.
YOUR CHOICES REGARDING SERVICE DATA.
We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Service Data. Depending on your data choices, certain Products may be limited or unavailable.
You can opt-out of receiving informational emails (such as newsletters or special offers) by clicking the opt-out or unsubscribe link on any of the communications we send you. As long as you use the Products or remain a customer, you may receive transactional emails (e.g., notices of material changes to this Privacy Policy).
You can manage your browser’s Cookies using the tools your browser provides, and you can opt-out of third-party vendor’s use of cookies (including advertising networks like Google and Bing) by visiting the
Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page
.
You may add, update, or delete the information you submitted when registering for or using the Products by contacting our support team using the contact information on the
Infrascale Support
page. When you update or delete any information, we may keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
To the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or deletion of your Service Data. Please see Section 11 of this Privacy Policy for more information.

This Section 16 applies where we process personal data in reliance on the DPF. If there is any conflict between this Section 16 and the remainder of this Privacy Policy, this Section 16 shall govern in respect of personal data processed in reliance on the DPF.
Infrascale complies with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Our accountability for personal data received from the EU, the UK (and Gibraltar), and/or Switzerland and subsequently transferred to a third party is consistent with the Principles. In particular, we remain responsible for any of your personal data that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for external processing on our behalf, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
In terms of the Choice Principle specifically:
We will only process your personal data in ways that are compatible with the purpose that we collected it for (as set out in the remainder of this Privacy Policy), or for purposes you later authorize.

Processing consent can be revoked at any time in the "My Profile" section of your account. Such revocation of consent is valid for future data processing and does not influence the validity of our data processing prior to your revocation.
Children
link
We believe that children have no need for our software, and therefore, we do not verify age or obtain parental or guardian consent for any data processing activity. ISL Online software does not contain age-sensitive material, nor should it pose any risk to children.
Data Protection
link
ISL Online Headquarters (XLAB d.o.o.) holds the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certificate, which demonstrates our commitment to information security. We use the globally recognized ISO 27001 standard as a framework for implementing our information security management systems (ISMS), which helps us keep information assets secure.
All our servers have disk encryption and are exclusively managed by the controller's OPS team (system administrators and other privileged access users). Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. We have physical and logical access procedures and controls in place, and we conduct training for our employees and contractors to ensure compliance with our data protection and privacy policies.
We employ the latest technologies and administrative procedures to safeguard your personal data. ISL Online servers are hosted by professional, industry-proven data centers with modern facilities and equipment such as redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data communication connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, fire suppression), and security devices.
ISL Online's master servers, which hold the data for which ISL Online acts as a
Controller
, are located within the European Union in ISO 27001-certified data centers. Session metadata for which ISL Online acts as a
Processor
is replicated across our worldwide network of servers and gets processed in a location selected by our load balancing system, which includes locations outside the EU. Server locations are shown here:
About Us
.
If you wish to have full control over server locations and data transfer, consider setting up a
Server License
(ISL Online service is hosted on your server(s) and managed by you) or using a
Managed Private Cloud
solution (ISL Online service is hosted on servers selected in accordance with your preferences and managed by ISL Online professionals).
Website Visitors
link
When you visit our website, we collect a limited scope of personal data transmitted to us by your browser. This helps us provide the service and improve the user experience. Data collected consists of your IP address and metadata (such as timestamp), technology used (operating system, browser, etc.), referrals (website from which the request comes), language, and the country of origin.
In addition, your IP address is collected by our systems for security reasons to detect anomalous activity. Anomalous activity includes, but is not limited to, DNS attacks, scam detection, and other activities that could compromise the security or availability of our systems. Browser metadata, language, and country of origin are used to serve the correct version of our website based on your location and language preference. Referral addresses, if obtained, are used by ISL Online to understand where the traffic is coming from.
Registration
link
If you decide to sign up for a free trial of the ISL Online software, we will ask you to provide the following personal information:
Email address
Username
Full name
You are only required to provide your email address during the registration process. We process this information to fulfill the contractual obligation. The username is chosen by you and can be used as an alternative to an email address when logging into ISL Online products and services. The full name is optional and can be specified to personalize the user experience when using ISL Online products and services.
For billing purposes, we also ask you to provide the name of the company, address, phone number, and similar information, which will be needed if you decide to buy a license. You can review and change this information at any time (log in to
My Account
> License > Change Information).
Based on your country of origin and the cookie information, your account information may only be processed by the ISL Online Headquarters, our subsidiaries, or
Authorized Partners
who have signed information sharing agreements with us. These processors have access to the personal data needed only to perform their customer care functions related to ISL Online's products and services and may not use it for any other purpose. You have the option to choose your preferred point of contact at any time (log in to
My Account
> License > Change Local Partner).
Notifications and Newsletter
link
We use internal systems to deliver important system messages and news about the ISL Online products and services to you. Once you sign up for the ISL Online software, we advise you to subscribe to the following two notification types:
Automatic Email Notifications (AEN)
: These are automatic notifications related to your ISL Online account status. For example, our systems will automatically send a message to your email address to notify you when your account expires.
Newsletter
: Approximately once a month, we send out a newsletter to notify you of important product or service enhancements, security announcements, or other information we consider relevant to our users.
When you subscribe to Automatic Email Notifications or the Newsletter, we will send emails to the email address specified in your account. You can change your subscription preference at any time (log in to
My Account
> My Profile > Change Subscription).
Additional Features
link
Some organizations may decide to enable additional features provided by ISL Online to enhance their remote desktop sessions, for example:
ISL Pronto, which is a text-chat solution that can be published on their website, allows Clients to join a remote support session directly from the respective websites.
End-of-Session dialogs, which pop up for Operators or Clients once the remote desktop session is finished for the purpose of collecting users' feedback.
Integration into third-party solutions, such as service desk or ticketing products, CRMs, ERPs, and other enterprise systems.
Enabling such additional features may result in collecting text messages (the transcript of the chat between the Operator and the Client) and different free-form inputs related to a remote desktop session and storing this data on ISL Online servers alongside metadata. Chat transcripts are available to Operators and Administrators of the respective organizations.
ISL Online implores users to be careful when entering personal or confidential data into session chats, end-of-session dialogs, and other places which allow unmoderated user input. This information becomes a subject of data processing; however, it is technically infeasible to exercise your data subject rights upon such data.
In the case of the integration of ISL Online software into third-party solutions, the chat transcript may be transferred to service desk or ticketing products, CRMs, ERPs, or other enterprise systems. We do not control the personal data collected and managed by these enterprise systems. We recommend that you contact the enterprise system providers directly for their privacy and data sharing policies.
Billing
link
When an organization decides to purchase ISL Online licenses, those licenses are assigned to a specific ISL Online account. These accounts are normally managed by Administrators (license owners). During the purchasing process, we will collect the information needed for billing and order processing purposes, which may include your name, company name, company address, email address, and telephone number. We will keep purchase orders and invoice records as long as requested by tax authorities. Please refer to the
Terms of Service
for details.
Customer Support
link
When you contact our service desk via live chat, email, or phone, we may collect your email address, your name, and your telephone number to respond to your inquiry. Your message will also be stored and might be shared with our Authorized Partners to provide prompt and localized customer service to you. Any personal data and other information intentionally or unintentionally provided by you while communicating with our support staff will be processed by us based on our legitimate interest in fulfilling your support request.
Product Use
link
When you register for a free trial, your account will be activated for product use. Upon registration and all subsequent successful login attempts, we will collect your IP and MAC addresses for auditing and licensing purposes.
Once logged into your account, ISL Online allows you to establish a remote desktop session with a remote computer or mobile device. The session may include different services such as text-chat, screen sharing, video call, and file transfer.
All remote desktop sessions are encrypted using symmetrical AES 256-bit keys. A secure SSL end-to-end tunnel is established between a local and a remote computer or device. This means that even the ISL Online servers cannot decrypt the content of the sessions but only transfer packets from one side to another. This means that we do not collect any personal data transmitted during remote desktop sessions.
We use proprietary geoDNS algorithms to distribute sessions to the nearest servers available. This means that users from a particular country are most likely to be connected through one of our servers hosted in that country (if any of our servers are in that country). For example, UK users will be almost certain to connect through our UK servers, German users will be almost certain to connect through our German servers, etc.
However, we do collect, store, and process metadata of the remote desktop sessions. This is needed for the legitimate purpose of enabling access to the ISL Online products and services explicitly requested by you. The list of metadata stored on ISL Online's servers may include the following personal data collected from your device as well as the device to which you are connecting.
From your device / pertaining to you, we may collect the following:
Username
Email address
IP address
MAC address
From the device you are connecting / pertaining to the person you are supporting; we may collect the following:
IP address
MAC address
In addition, ISL Online engages certain third parties while providing our products that allow us to provide a stable and secure service. More information on them is available in chapter 17.A - "Service Provisioning" as well as within the Data Processing Agreement (DPA). Third parties we engage may collect the following:
IP address
ISL Online processes the personal data of the people you are supporting upon your request and according to your instructions, thus ISL Online assumes the role of data processor. A data processing agreement (DPA) is available to you once you log in at islonline.com under the "My Profile" section.
A detailed list of basic session parameters (metadata) is available in our
Security Statement
.
Transfer of Personal Data to Third Countries
link
ISL Online utilizes a grid of servers worldwide to provide our hosted service. A distributed data allocation allows us to guarantee 24/7 availability and reliability of the remote desktop software as a service around the globe.
When transferring (personal) data outside of the European Union, ISL Online uses the following safeguards and measures to ensure adequate protection of data:
All data is encrypted in flight and at rest, with ISL Online being the only entity to possess the encryption/decryption keys;
ISL Online has obtained and maintains the ISO 27001 certification;
In cases where data export to a third country is not covered by an Adequacy Decision, ISL Online relies on Standard Contractual Clauses signed with selected providers.
You can request information about the data stored about you via the contact details provided in Chapter 3.
In addition, the third parties which ISL Online engages while providing our product will process certain personal data (see Chapter 14). The third parties are described in detail in chapter 17.A - "Service Provisioning" as well as in the DPA.
ISL Online has taken measures available to us to minimize the scope of data shared with third parties and to prevent it from being transferred outside of EEA or to countries without adequacy decisions. In cases where that is not possible, ISL Online relies on Standard Contractual Clauses signed with those third parties.
Cookies
link
Our websites use cookies, which are small text files that are placed on your computer upon your visit. Cookies are widely used to allow websites to work, or to work more efficiently. Besides the essential and functional cookies that are either required for the service to work correctly or improve the user experience, ISL Online uses some third-party cookies, which you can opt out of. Please refer to our
Cookies Policy
for more details.
Third Parties
link
Service Provisioning
ISL Online engages certain 3rd parties while providing the Hosted Service to our end-users. Those parties are essential and are engaged solely in the context of service provision. They are described in more detail in the DPA available to our customers ("My Account" - "My Profile" - "DPA"), however they fall into 3 main categories:
Data Centers
- (physically) hosting the nodes of ISL Online's grid providing the Hosted Service. They store and manage encrypted data. Since they provide network connectivity to the servers, they will process the IP address of the Operator and the Client connected to a remote desktop session.
STUN/TURN/ICE
- providers that support the "Direct Connection" feature of ISL Online. Third party (TURN/STUN) servers allow the Operator and the Client to discover each other and establish a direct connection between them, rather than the connection being handled via ISL Conference Proxy servers (ICP). Since they provide IP discovery capabilities, they will process the IP address of the Operator and the Client trying to establish a remote desktop session.
IP Quality and reputation
- services used by ISL Online in the session establishment process to obtain additional information about a potentially suspicious IP address trying to establish a session. Sessions deemed as "high risk" according to our internal security algorithms are dropped to protect our customers. They will process the IP address of the Operator and the Client provided to them by ISL Online for further verification.

For organizations that prefer using a cloud solution but also want complete control over the locations of the ISL Online servers hosting their data and remote desktop connections, we offer a special plan called Managed Private Cloud (MPC). This option allows users to enjoy all the advantages of cloud computing in a PRIVATE cloud environment, without the need to invest in hardware or human resources (sysops) for setting up, configuring, monitoring, and maintaining the system. The Managed Private Cloud ensures a higher level of data privacy and control, catering to the specific needs of your organization.
By choosing the Managed Private Cloud plan, you can benefit from the following:
Dedicated, private ISL Online cloud infrastructure tailored to your organization's requirements.
Enhanced security and compliance with your organization's data protection policies.
Complete control over the server locations hosting your data and remote desktop connections.
Customizable performance and scalability to meet your organization's growth and demands.
Reduced investment in hardware and human resources for managing the system.
If you are interested in the Managed Private Cloud plan or need more information, please
Contact Us
for details. Our team will be happy to assist you in finding the best solution for your organization's needs.

Self-Hosted Solution
link
For security-sensitive organizations, such as banks, national agencies, or corporate environments, we offer self-hosted models (Server License, Private Cloud). With these models, the ISL Online system is installed on the server(s) hosted by the organization itself. In this case, all remote desktop connections are established through the server(s) controlled by the organization.
As the self-hosted installation is a stand-alone system, where all data (including metadata) remains within the closed corporate environment, the organization is responsible for the administration of the server(s) and for protecting the personal data of their users (Operators and Clients). If you are using a self-hosted system and have concerns, inquiries, or requests related to your personal data, you need to contact the Administrators of the respective organizations.
ISL Online helps organizations using our self-hosted system meet personal data protection requirements by tailoring the ISL Online products to their needs. The benefits of a self-hosted solution include:
Complete control over data and remote desktop connections within the organization's secure environment.
Enhanced data security and compliance with the organization's data protection policies.
Customizable performance and scalability to meet the organization's growth and demands.
Reduced reliance on external cloud infrastructure providers.
Full responsibility for server administration and personal data protection.
If you are interested in a self-hosted solution or need more information, please
Contact Us
for details. Our team will be happy to assist you in finding the best solution for your organization's needs.

Anonymization and Pseudonymization
link
At ISL Online, we prioritize the privacy of your personal data. We minimize the collection of personal data and focus on anonymizing most of the data we collect, stripping it of any identifiable information. This ensures that it is impossible to derive insights about a specific individual. However, for the personal data we do collect and store, we may employ pseudonymization:
Upon your explicit request, or
According to set retention periods.
You have the right to be forgotten. Pseudonymization is a data processing method that transforms personal data in such a way that it can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information. This additional information is kept separately, ensuring that your personal data is rendered nearly impossible to reidentify.
We use reasonable efforts and deidentification techniques to pseudonymize your personal data. For organizations using our self-hosted systems, we provide pseudonymization support tools to Administrators. This allows organizations to maintain a high level of privacy and comply with data protection regulations while using our services.
Previous Product Versions

If you are using an earlier version of our products, we recommend upgrading to the latest version to ensure that your experience aligns with the data protection practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Your Rights

Know which types of personal data we have in our possession, how we obtained it, how we protect it, and how we process it.

Personal Data We Process
Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (“Personal Data”).
We may collect data or ask you to provide certain data when you visit our websites and use our products and services. The sources from which we collect Personal Data include:
Data collected directly from you or your device relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”), and may include direct identifiers such as name, postal and email address, phone number, and online or indirect identifiers such as login account, login password, marketing preferences, social media account, and/or IP address;
If we link other data with your Personal Data, we will treat that linked data as Personal Data; and
We may also collect Personal Data from trusted third-party sources such as service providers, distributors, resellers, app stores, contact centers, and engage third parties such as marketing, survey, analytics or software suppliers to collect Personal Data to assist us.
We do not process special categories of personal data, such as data concerning health, race, ethnicity or political opinions, or deduce in any way this type of information from data we collect within our products.
We organize the Personal Data we process into these basic categories: Billing Data, Account Data, Product Data and Communications Data.

Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough. With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail.
Security and Threat Intelligence
We process Personal Data to support network and information security efforts. In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data in a proportionate manner for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. This covers the ability of our networks or of our information systems to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the data we store or transmit, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.
Moreover, as a member of the security community, we also cooperate with other players across the security landscape, in particular by exchanging threat intelligence resources, and aid in research and development of new security solutions.
The Personal Data we process for the purpose listed above includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:
Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);
Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including phishing);
Email header detail including addresses and intermediary systems (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);
Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files);
Samples (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files);
Samples behavior (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful files);
URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful content); and/or
IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful content).
Product messaging - In-product and Email Messages
We have a legitimate interest in messaging our users about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and about products that supplement or improve the products already purchased. We can also message our customers with information and offers relating to already purchased products (e.g. time-limited offers).
If you are our customer, we feel a responsibility to inform you about security and utility improvements and possible problems to your device and software, and provide you with effective solutions relevant to these problems. Because of this, we have a legitimate interest to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication to you so that you are likely to find them relevant and non-intrusive at the same time. We use certain limited subsets of Billing Data, Account Data, and Product Data to deliver this communication.
Product and business improvement
We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data to understand user conversions, acquisitions and campaign performance through various distribution channels, and users’ download, activation and interactions with our products. For example, we want to know how many users clicked on our offers, or purchased our product after seeing one of our ads. These analytics help us improve functionality, effectiveness, security and reliability of our products and business activities as well as helping us to develop new products. This processing includes using third-party tools. Please refer to our
Products Policy
for the list of third-party tools used for the specific products and services.
How We Process Your Personal Data
We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the Personal Data that we use:
For free versions, this disconnection or removal of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially activated. For paid users we keep Billing Data in a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than handling payments and our own analytical and financial management activities.
For both paid and free versions, we continuously monitor for, minimize, disconnect and remove all direct identifiers during the normal performance of the products and services.
Processing of IP Addresses
Your IP address is collected at the time at which your product or service is being provided for the purpose of downloading and installing the products, product authorization, fraud and malware detection and for the purpose of facilitating our billing process. In particular for delivering the content in accordance with your device(s) settings, determining appropriate language settings for communicating with you, troubleshooting issues, and generating appropriate diagnostics reports.
Please refer to our
Products Policy
for specific use of IP address by our products and services.
Personalization
We use relevant Billing Data, Account Data, Product Data and your answers from surveys, in which you can participate, to personalize our offers, communication and product recommendations.
We do not take any decisions solely based on algorithms, including profiling, that would significantly affect you.
How We Disclose Your Personal Data
We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within our group of companies, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, when required by applicable law. Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and the relevant
Products Policy
sections. If we disclose your Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.
We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer. Data obtained through short code programs will not be shared with any third-parties for their marketing reasons/purposes.
Payment processors
In certain cases we may use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are properly regulated and authorized to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes other than arranging these services for us. However, they are independent controllers of your data with their own responsibility.
These are our long-term payment processors:

Service Providers
We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and
Products Policy
. We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential.
Such service providers may include contact centers, professional consultants (including to defend or to exercise our rights), and marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers. We may also connect with business partners to provide specific services to you such as identity restoration. To provide identity restoration services, we may share, at your direction, your data with financial institutions, financial services companies, and other authorized third parties.
We use Salesforce to provide us the CRM platform (see their
privacy information
including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers).
We use Qualtrics as the provider of the experience management platform used to collect and evaluate customer feedback and insights (see their
Privacy statement
including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
We use Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc., for hosting our Forum (see their
privacy information
).
Sometimes these service providers, for example- our distributors, resellers, and app store partners- will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”) and privacy statements will apply to such relationships.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Advertising Companies
To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve third-party ads in our products for mobile devices. To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product. The SDK collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you.
Only few of our free products serve third-party ads. You will be asked for consent during the installation process of any such product. For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our
Consent Policy
which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy.
We may share limited categories of personal data (online identifiers and product-related information used to display appropriate ads) with these third parties for cross-contextual advertising purposes, as defined under California and other applicable U.S. state laws. “Cross-contextual advertising” in this context means advertisements we believe will be more interesting and useful to you based on your data, including data related to the use of our Services. Third parties may use the data we’ve shared with them to show you personalized ads. No data is sold to these third parties.
Distributors, Resellers
We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of distribution, sale or management of our products. Our partners may communicate with you about Avast products or services. In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Cookies Providers
Our websites use cookies to personalize your experience on our sites, to tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and to give us insights into user interactions and user base as a whole so we can improve our communications and products. While using our websites, you will be asked to authorize the collection and use of data by cookies according to the terms of the
Cookie Policy
.
Analytics Tool Providers
We use analytical tools, including third-party analytical tools, which allow us, among other things, to identify potential performance or security issues with our products, to improve their stability and function, to understand how you use our products, and websites so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, and to evaluate and improve our campaigns. We use Service and Device data for analytics.
While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise. Below, we list these partners and tools and their privacy policies.

Public Authorities
In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law. No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to:
A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;
A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process;
Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or
A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud.
No data is shared for cross-contextual advertising and no data is sold to these third parties.
Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings
Like any other consumer brand, we too go through our own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Our business decisions and market developments therefore affect our structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate.
If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable. Information including personal data relating to our business may be shared with other parties in order to evaluate and conclude the transaction. This would also be the case if we were required by law to make such changes.
Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Group Entities and to Third-Party Vendors
We are a global business that provides products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data processed.
The intra-group transfers within the Gen Digital Group are covered by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. Check
here
to access the Gen Digital Inc. Data Privacy Framework Notice.
At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data originating from the EEA outside of the EEA or cooperate with a third-party vendor located outside the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate safeguards, such as
Standard Contractual Clauses
or
adequacy decisions
adopted by the European Commission, to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.
Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include: allowing access to Personal Data stored in the Google Cloud Platform to Google personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the
Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings
section).
How We Protect Your Personal Data
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data.
Administrative Safeguards
Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave the company. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.
Technical Safeguards
We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize technical safeguards such as up-to-date
firewall
protection for an additional layer of security, high-quality anti-virus software, and we regularly update our
virus
definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to adopt appropriate measures if we deem them necessary.
Physical Safeguards
Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.
Proportionality
We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.
Children’s Privacy
Our websites, services and products are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect data from, minors (as defined by applicable law) except where explicitly described otherwise in the privacy notices of services designed specifically for purposes, such as to assist you by providing child online protection features. In such cases, we will only collect and process Personal Data related to any child under the age specified in particular jurisdictions, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process. Details about this processing is included in our
Products Policy
. Please refer to the specific applicable notices for this information.
How Long We Store Your Personal Data
We keep your personal data as long as we need it to provide you with our services, to comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s legitimate interests (such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products; to defend against legal claims, complaints, litigation or regulatory proceedings). Often, there are different reasons to keep a specific piece of information that overlap and influence each other.
When determining the specific retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of service provided to you, the nature of our relationship with you, and mandatory retention periods provided by law and the relevant statute of limitations.
More specifically, we will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the following periods:
For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights and keeping proper business records. So, if we take payments from you, we archive limited payment information related to transactions for the time specified in law (depending on the relevant jurisdiction) to maintain proper business records, meet our audit obligations, detect and prevent fraud and to protect our legal rights in case there are disputes. We also keep your Billing data to enable the renewal of your subscriptions;
For Account Data, for as long as you maintain your account;
For Product Data, only as long as necessary for the purposes of a particular product or service. Where possible, we use rolling deletion periods which means we regularly delete collected data in the given periods starting from the collection of that respective data. The rolling deletion periods for Product Data are not longer than six years. You can find specific rolling deletion periods for each of our products and their purposes in our
Products Policy
. Please note that when you uninstall our product, processing for service provision, in-product messaging, analytics and third-party ads, if applicable, dependent on the installed product shall cease. After the uninstallation, we will continue to process your Product Data for statistical purposes for up to six years. We have measures in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws, including pseudonymization.
For Communications Data, for as long as necessary to resolve your requests or questions and maintain evidence of such communications to defend our rights and protect our interests. If you receive product updates, offers, and other promotional information or messages, we process the data until you unsubscribe.
Storage of Your Personal Data
We are a global company that processes personal data in many countries. As part of our business, we may transfer data across the Gen group, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and third-party vendors of Gen located worldwide, including Avast, Avira, LifeLock and Norton entities. Data can be located in places where we offer our products or have our offices, infrastructure or data centers, including Europe and the United States.
Transfers of your personal data within Gen Digital and its subsidiaries and affiliates are done pursuant to our intra-group data transfer agreement including EU Commission-approved
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs). At the same time, intra-group transfers within the Gen Digital Group are covered by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. Click
here
to access the Gen Digital Inc. Data Privacy Framework Notice.
Before we transfer data to third parties, we look at the risks to the data associated with such transfer. We require third parties to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly. For data originating from the European Economic Area we rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
.
Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA may also include: allowing access to personal data stored in the cloud (such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform) to personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services.
In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
Your Privacy Rights
There are a variety of data protection laws around the globe that provide privacy rights to you as our customer. You can make certain choices about how your data is used by us by adjusting the privacy settings of the relevant product.
Besides that, you have the following rights (depending on the region):
Right to information - Right to receive information about the processing of your Personal Data, prior to processing as well as during the processing, upon request. In particular, but not limited to:
categories of personal data collected, sold, or disclosed by us;
purposes for which categories of personal data are collected or sold;
categories of sources from which we collect personal data;

Right to data portability - The right to receive Personal Data which you have provided and is being processed on the basis of consent or where it is necessary for the purpose of conclusion and performance of a contract, in machine-readable format. This right applies exclusively to Personal Data where processing is carried out by automated means.
Right to object - Applies to cases of processing carried out in legitimate interest. You have the right to object to such processing, on grounds relating to your particular situation, and we are required to assess the processing in order to ensure compliance with all legally binding rules and applicable regulations. In case of direct marketing, we shall cease processing Personal Data for such purposes after the objection.
Right to withdraw consent - In the case of processing based on your consent, as specified in our
Consent Policy
, you can withdraw your consent at any time by using the same method (if technically possible) you used to provide it to us (the exact method will be described in more detail with each consent when you provide it). The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.
Right to restriction of processing - You have the right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data if: You are contesting the accuracy of your Personal Data, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of your Personal Data; the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the Personal Data and request the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or you have objected to processing of your Personal Data, and there is a pending verification whether our legitimate grounds override your interests.
Right to Equal Service - Right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights, subject to certain limitations.
Right to contact a supervisory authority or court - You may contact and lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority – The Office for Personal Data Protection (Czech: Úřad na ochranu osobních údajů – www.uoou.cz) or your local authority or a relevant court.
You can submit your requests relating to your data subject rights and access to documentation relating to appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers through our online form:
https://support.avast.com/en-us/contact/dsr
.
The fulfillment of data subject rights listed above will depend on the category of Personal Data and the processing activity. In all cases, we strive to fulfill your request.
We will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a Data Subject. When we are faced with an unusually large number of requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months. If we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to resolve the situation informally.
Where requests we receive are unfounded or excessive, in particular because they repeat, we may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request.
Identification of an individual may not be necessary for some of our free products to be delivered to you or to function. In this case, we do not and will not maintain, acquire or process additional information solely in order to identify the users of our free products and services.
Consistent with our privacy by design, privacy by default and data minimization practices, we may not be able to identify you in connection with Product Data relating to specific free products and services. However, you can go directly to your product settings and explore the available privacy options.
Your Choices in products
You can make certain choices about how your data is used by us by adjusting the privacy settings of the relevant product. Please check your product settings to set your privacy preferences there.

TARGETED ADVERTISING AND REMARKETING
You may see advertisements for our services on other websites and mobile applications because we work with third party advertisers to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities. Through our relationships with these advertisers, we can target messaging to our users by interest-based, demographic, contextual, and other means. These third party advertisers track your online activities over time and across websites and mobile applications by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. They use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites and mobile applications that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites and mobile applications that participate in the advertising networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Some third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA” -
https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/
) or Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI” -
www.networkadvertising.org
). We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising set forth by the DAA. You have the ability to opt-out of targeting through both the DAA and NAI, as described below.

This does not mean that we endorse these websites or the goods or services they provide. We do not make any representations or warranties about any website that may be linked to the Site. Such other websites are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for, their information, products or activities. Our privacy practices may differ from those of these other websites. If you provide Personal Information at one of these third party websites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that website, not our Privacy Policy. Please make sure you understand the other website's privacy policy before providing such website with any Personal Information.

Explanation of Privacy Rights and Choices
Access.
You may request a copy of the personal information we maintain about you. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information in Sontiq-owned Member Dashboards while your account is current (or to exercise any of the other rights).
For security purposes, we cannot provide your full Social Security number or your full credit card numbers.
Transfer.

Correction.
You may request that we modify any incomplete or inaccurate information we maintain about you.
Erasure/Deletion.

It is not always possible to completely remove all of your information from our systems. This is often due to legal or regulatory requirements.
Restrict Processing.
You may request that we suspend the processing of your personal information. You may want to do this, for example, if you want us to verify the accuracy of the information or to ask us to confirm the reason for processing.
“Automated decision making” is when choices are made by computers without the involvement of a person. Sontiq does not make decisions using automated means.
Explanation of Data Processing
Our privacy practices as required under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) have been incorporated into this Privacy Notice.
Legal Basis for Processing.
A legal basis for processing personal information is required under the GDPR.
We are fulfilling a contract when:
Sontiq monitors your personal information and sends alerts,
we process payments, or
preventing fraudulent access to your accounts.
We are meeting the legitimate interests of our business when:
we contact you regarding new products and services,
we capture analytic information to improve or personalize our products, services, and website, or
preventing fraudulent use of our services.
We are addressing our legal obligations when:
reporting income and related information to tax authorities.
Objection to Processing.
You may object to the processing of your personal information. This may be done if you feel it is inappropriate for Sontiq to rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing. When you object, we will limit the processing of your information. Once the objection is resolved, we will either resume processing or delete the Personal Information as appropriate.
International Transfers of Personal Information.
Our Services operate in the United States. Information we collect, including personal information, will be transferred, processed, stored, and used in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located. Your information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement according to the laws of the United States. Sontiq utilizes
Standard Contractual Clauses
for the transfer of information outside of the Europe. This participation applies to all personal information that is received from European residents.
Registering a Compliant.
There may be times when you have a concern about the processing of your personal information. We ask that you please contact the Sontiq Privacy Office at these times as detailed in our “Contact information” section below.

9. Securing personal information
Sontiq maintains a comprehensive information security program that utilizes administrative (policies, standards, and processes), physical, and technical controls designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal information.
We use industry-standard safeguards to protect your information. While we make reasonable efforts to safeguard personal information once we receive it, the protection of your information cannot be guaranteed as no website is completely secure. You should only access our website within a secure environment.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password(s) and all activities that occur using your password(s). You should notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password(s) or accounts, or if you believe your personal information has been exposed.
10. Retaining personal information
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or processed, as previously described in this Notice, and consistent with applicable laws. For instance, we retain personal information, collected through our Services and website, for as long as a user’s account is active or as needed to provide Services to our customers. When you give up your membership, your personal information is retained for a short period of time in the event you decide to rejoin.
When determining retention periods, we consider our relationship with you and your information, the nature and sensitivity of the information, and what is reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide and improve our Services. We also adjust retention periods to comply with our legal, reporting, or accounting obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. We regularly review our retention periods and assess our data minimization practices, retaining the least amount of information for the shortest retention period, while still upholding all our obligations.
11. Corporate reorganization
In the event that we enter into, or intend to enter into, a transaction that alters the structure of our business, such as a reorganization, merger, acquisition, sale, joint venture, assignment, consolidation, transfer, change of control, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, we may share your personal information. We may also share your personal information if we undergo bankruptcy or liquidation, in the course of such proceedings.
12. Links to other sites or services
Our websites may contain content, links, or applications that are supplied by a third party. These third parties may also collect, store, or have access to your information when you interact with them for their own commercial purposes. In some cases, you may be directed to other sites and applications that are operated by third parties that we do not control. This includes when you use third-party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or other posting or content sharing tools.
This Notice does not apply to other third-party sites or services. If you click on a link or browse to a third-party site from our site/service, your activity and interaction is subject to that third-party's rules and policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy statements on those other sites to understand their privacy practices and make an informed decision regarding your use or interaction with their site/service.
