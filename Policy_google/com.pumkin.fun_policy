Further information about the processing of Personal Data
Selling goods and services online
The Personal Data collected are used to provide the User with services or to sell goods, including payment and possible delivery.
The Personal Data collected to complete the payment may include the credit card, the bank account used for the transfer, or any other means of payment envisaged. The kind of Data collected by Studycat depends on the payment system used.
The Service is directed to children under the age of 13
Studycat is directed to children under the age of 13. It doesn't require the child to disclose any more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in its activity.
Parents may review the personal information about their child collected by Studycat - if any - outlined in the rest of this policy, ask for its deletion and request any further collection or use to be omitted by contacting the Owner. Parents may also agree to the collection and use of their childâ€™s information, but still not allow disclosure to third parties, unless disclosure is integral to the Service.
We do not collect personal information about California consumers below the age of 16
We do not knowingly collect personal information of consumers who are below the age of 16 nor do we sell or share it.
Rights for registered California Users under the age of 18
California's "Online Eraser" law, part of California's Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services targeting minors to allow registered Users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of content they post.
If a registered User fits that description and posted content on Studycat, they may request removal of such content by contacting the Owner or its privacy policy coordinator at the contact details provided in this document.
In response to this request, the Owner may make content posted by the registered User invisible to other registered Users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the content may remain on the Owner's servers. It may also be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted this content.
Equal protection of User Data
Studycat shares User Data only with third parties carefully selected to ensure that they provide the same or equal protection of User Data as stated in this privacy policy and requested by applicable data protection laws. Further information on data processing and privacy practices by third parties can be found in their respective privacy policies.
