The way we process these data, why and on what legal basis we do this are explained below.
Sensitive data
Sensitive data in the GDPR are the so-called "special categories of personal data", e.g. on your racial or ethnic origin, your health, or your political opinions.
We do not collect any sensitive data from you.
Data from children
If you are younger than 16, you need to obtain a clear consent of your parent or guardian if you are willing to use our games. A parent or a guardian can at any time exercise all the applicable rights available by law and those listed in this Data Policy on your behalf.
What do we process your data for?
We only process a user’s personal data in compliance with the relevant data protection regulations. This means that a user’s data shall only be processed if the user has given his or her legal permission for us to do so.
This is the case especially then when data processing is required in order for us to be able to provide our contractual and online services, or when required by law, we are in possession of the consent of the user, and when it is collected for the sake of our legally legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation and safety of our online product as per Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR, in particular with regard to range measurement, the creation of profiles for advertising and marketing purposes, as well as the collection of access data and the use of the services of third-party providers).
We feel obligated to point out that Art. 6 (1) (a) and Art. 7 of the GDPR serve as the legal basis for consent, Art. 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing for the performance of services and the performance of contractual measures, Art. 6 (1) (c) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing in order to fulfill our legal obligations, and Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing in order to safeguard legitimate interests.
Additionally, your country and language is used to provide you with a localisation of our games - we will try to serve you content in your language and our in-game shop in your local currency.
Payments and invoices
If you want to buy in-game currency in our in-game shop, your interaction will usually be with third-party payment processors. In either case, if a payment was successful, we get this information as a digital invoice, which we store to fulfil legal requirements (Article 6.1.c GDPR), to retain them in the case of legal dispute (legitimate interest; Article 6.1.f GDPR), and to optimise our web presence for you (legitimate interest; Article 6.1.f GDPR).
These invoices contain data on what item you purchased, how much you paid for the item and what method you used to pay us with. We do not store information that could be used to make a payment on your behalf.
Security and fraud prevention
(legitimate interest; Article 6.1.f GDPR)

We don't store data such as your IP address and certain device information when you access our games and interact with those.
Optimisation of games and campaigns
(legitimate interest; Article 6.1.f GDPR)
We don't track information about your behaviour and preferences.
Over the course of campaign optimisation, we share some of these data with third-party trackers (listed below).

Your personal data outside of Playful Tap SRL.
We share your data only where it is legally permissible to do so, either when it's required to fulfil contracts you may have with us (Article 6.1.b GDPR) or on basis of legitimate interest (Article 6.1.f GDPR).
We share your personal data only if you have given us permission to do so, in aggregate or anonymised form (preventing the data from being linked to other data you may have supplied elsewhere), or with providers that are contractually obliged to treat your data with care.
We exchange data with providers in the following categories:
●       Hosting and content distribution providers. These typically have no direct access to our systems, but provide network infrastructure that will necessarily process your IP address to deliver our assets.
●       Payment providers. When you make a payment through a payment provider, we will get invoice information from these providers. Any payment details needed to actually make a payment on your behalf is handled only by the payment providers, not by us.

●       Crash reporting. Our mobile games embed crash reporting functionality. The crash reports contain only anonymous information. Nonetheless, you can opt-out of this in the settings of the application.
The providers we use are contractually bound to treat your data with the utmost care. Whenever the process allows, we anonymise or pseudonymise your data.
Under no circumstances do we sell your data to third parties.
