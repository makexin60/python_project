2) HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED
Invaluable and AuctionZip use personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways, in general falling into the following categories:
Usage Tracking for Business Development and Management
Our primary business is conducted entirely online. As such, our success will depend on our ability to gauge popularity of one feature or product offering over another, or on our ability to understand how people use our products. Tracking and aggregating usage information will allow us to develop this understanding.
Our Communications Features
Our site offers registered users the ability to forward along objects of interest to others, and in some cases to communicate with an auction house concerning an object offered in an upcoming auction. To facilitate this communication, a registered user's email of record must be accessed.
As a service to auction houses, we keep track of communications between registered users and auction houses. Not all auction houses permit direct communication with our users. We may store destination emails sent by users to auction houses with questions or request for more information about an object. If an auction house requests more information about a user, we may share that information if we determine that is in our interest to do so. We may disable your capability to communicate with a specific auction house. We may also revoke your auction house communication privileges at any time without notifying you if we determine that it is in our interest to do so.
Communications with Our Customers, Customer Support, and Promotional E-mail
From time to time, it may be necessary to notify subscribers of impending subscription expirations, account or credit card issues, transactions completed, and in the case of registered users' terms agreement or policy changes. While such communication will typically be conducted through email, as appropriate, mail or phone may also be used. We may also use your personal information to send you e-mail newsletters and other promotional emails about services and products that we believe may be of interest to you.
While we do not presently, in the future we may use the information you provide to send you e- mail and mail only for products offered by Invaluable or its affiliates, or to determine your interest in programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. These materials will be offered on an opt-in basis only.
Note: users will be able to opt out of Invaluable or AuctionZip via the account settings or by contact Customer Care directly.
