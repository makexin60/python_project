For instance, if you elect to provide your email address, we may use that information to send you promotional information about our products and services. If we do, where required by law, for example if you are in the EU, we will only send you such emails if you consent to us doing so at the time you provide us with your personal information. You may opt out of receiving emails by following the instructions contained in each promotional email we send you or by contacting us. If you unsubscribe from our marketing lists, you will no longer receive marketing communications but we will continue to contact you regarding our Website and Services and to respond to your requests.

Please contact your Company's privacy officer directly to familiarize yourself with these.
Service Providers: We may transfer personal information to third parties engaged to assist us in providing the Services and Website to you on our behalf, including hosting, email, newsletter, database, analytics, and sales/customer relationship management services. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance on our behalf, and they are required to appropriately safeguard personal information in their custody and to comply with our Privacy Policy. Our services providers may be located in Canada and the United States, and information that we collect may therefore be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions.
Law Enforcement: We may disclose personal information if applicable law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, legal process or court order requires or authorizes us to do so. We may also share when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

Collection of Information from Children
Our Website and Services are not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

In the event we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such personal information without undue delay.
Security
We make commercially reasonable efforts to appropriately safeguard the personal information in our custody and control against loss, theft and unauthorized access. Please understand, however, that no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to us is done at your own risk.
Notice Regarding Public Posting Areas
Please note that any information you include in a message you post in a public posting area is available to other users. If you do not want people to know your e-mail address, for example, do not include it in any message you post publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.
Links to Third Party Sites
The Website may offer links to other third party websites. You should be aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information (including information generated through the use of cookies) when you link to their websites. We are not responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information, so it is important to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing them with your personal information.
Retention and Storage of Your Personal Information
We retain your data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulations, and Service Agreements. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.
To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we use your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
For the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we or one of our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider may process and store your personal information outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada and the United States, and under the laws of those other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other provinces or foreign jurisdictions may be entitled to access your personal information.

We may keep minimum information about you in a suppression list in order to ensure your choices are respected in the future and to comply with data protection laws (such processing is necessary for our and your legitimate interest in pursuing the purposes described above);
Right to withdraw consent:
If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect any processing of your data before we received notice that you wished to withdraw consent.
