Parents be warned, I am a parent writing this review. I had my 14 year old daughter ask me " mommy, how should I do her hair"? Scrolling at the top was a conversation which was stating such vulgarity like eat my pu..., F word repeatedly and so many other vulgar words. The rating says 12+ this,is an absolute lie, poor development and design. We would see why kids in these United States have no moral compass, no respect and decency. I had this discussion with my child and she deleted the app, unfortunately I had to download in order,to,give this review.

Speaking for a generation of "kids in these United states", our moral compass, respect, and decency isn't built off the shameing of human nature. Sex isn't shameful nor is it sinful. The vulgarity in these words is only due to your irrationally high standard of them. Profanity is seen as vulgar, simply because is blasphemous. I'm sorry you were butthurt by the words and actions taken in a game, but I'm more sorry to your child who seems to have now learned shame in sexuality. Your view of a beautiful generation, which is full of acceptance, respect in those deserving of it, full of movements for the betterment of society, shows how simply ignorant you are. Blame your generation for raising ours, if you must blame anyone. I'm sorry for showing you no respect or decency, I guess that's the child in me, but you deserve none. Using a games words to push your narrative of the barbaric youth. If this game offends you, don't let her play it. But she's heard it all before. She'll forget those words, what she won't forget, is her mother shaming her for human desires.

I’m 14 and I’ve heard worse in school. If you don’t want your daughter playing it then don’t let her but it’s all just a story. Books may say similar things. So it’s ridiculous that you have to leave a review like this. She’s 14 and could more than likely chose to play this game. It’s the same as her picking up and reading a book with profanity in it. Don’t slam the autors of the chapters provided. It’s their app and they can do as they please with thier app. You don’t want your child to play it. Don’t let her.

I'm liking this app better than CHOICES app.  More rewards & we can reread without costing us tickets/keys & its way less wait to get new tickets (2 hours to wait per key on CHOICES is absurd). BUT some of the stories here are poorly done, or they get really good then abruptly end.  Some you can only end on good notes if you pay for the choices, and in HIS it's all kinds of stupid how the endings are played out.  As well, Bad boy blues you can only keep your man if you pay for the choice.  New book Zombies...so funny until it started costing diamonds & I stopped reading it.  Another book does that too so I just won't read it either.   Not cool.  Also, suddenly all the new updates are not compatible with my iPad??  Now I am missing out on some of the extra benefits.  Overall I still like it & it definitely is better than CHAPTERS which I read way less than I read this.  ���� I like being able to earn diamonds & incentives and not having to wait hours in keys/tickets just to reread a book already completed.

They never said they were going to give you a redemption code immediately after you subscribed. They said they'll keep you updated on it and other things

I love chapters been playing it since it was first released. I love the advent calendar too mostly. Its great getting single chapter original stories, but if they are a prize should it cost NO dimonds to read it. Paying dimonds for choices just makes it another story like the new date ones you have put out. Not really a prize or gift anymore.
