We may disclose any or all of the categories of personal information collected for business purposes such as offering, developing and maintaining products and services, completing transactions with individuals or other businesses, preventing fraud, for our everyday business operations, or as required or permitted by law.
Personal information does not include public information lawfully made available from governmental records or de-identified or aggregate consumer information. We will implement technical safeguards to prohibit re-identification of de-identified information about you. We also reserve the right to create or allow others to create aggregate consumer information data sets by ensuring that individual consumer identities have been removed and are not linked or reasonably linkable to any consumer or household, including via a device. The CCPA does not require that such information be re-identified in response to a request made pursuant to the CCPA.

Browser Signals
The CCPA requires us to state how we handle and process Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signals, which is referred to in the CCPA as opt-out preference signal (“OOPS”). GPC/OOPS are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of personal information. To use an OOPS/GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the OOPS/GPC. As of January 1, 2023, the CCPA’s updated regulations, which are supposed to set forth requirements as to OOPS/GPC, have not yet been finalized. We will process OOPS/GPC as required when the regulations are finalized. In the meantime, to our knowledge, we have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our websites. Similar to when you configure cookies manually, GPC/OOPS will only apply to the browser and device you are currently using to visit our websites. It will not apply to a different browser or device. If you visit our webpages using a different browser or device, you will need to exercise your choice for each browser or device.
Sale or Sharing of Personal Information
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives California residents the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information.
We do not sell your personal information (PI) for monetary consideration. Third-Party digital businesses (“
Third-Party Digital Businesses
”) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that collect personal information about you on our website, or otherwise collect and process personal information that we make available about you, including digital activity information. Giving access to personal information on our website, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a “sale” and/or “sharing”. Therefore, we will treat such PI collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the opt-out requests described above. In some instances, the PI we make available about you is collected directly by such Third-Party Digital Businesses using cookies or other tracking technologies on our website or our advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as “
cookie PI
").
Please refer to the section “Sale or Sharing of Personal Information" in the

California Privacy Rights
California consumers have the privacy rights described in this section, subject to certain limitations. Personal information protected by other laws such as the Financial Services Modernization Act (also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is exempted from the following CCPA rights. Personal information provided to us or collected by us in connection with insurance or financial products and services are protected by these laws and not subject to the following rights granted by the CCPA.
You may submit a request described below or submit one through an authorized agent (examples of an authorized agent may include a power of attorney, guardian, conservator or one registered with the California Secretary of State). Requests submitted to us are subject to review, identification, and verification. We will acknowledge receipt of your request and provide information about processing the request and the verification process. We may ask you for information which allows us to confirm your identity in relation to information we currently have. In addition, we may require notarization of any forms submitted. We will reimburse you for reasonable fees incurred for the notarization of documents. We may also ask for documentation verifying that your designated agent is authorized to act on your behalf. We may not be able to fulfill your request if we are unable to verify you are the consumer that is the subject of the request, or that the agent is, in fact, authorized to act on your behalf.
We will make reasonable efforts to identify personal information that we collect, use, and disclose to respond to your request. In some instances we may not be able to process a request because, for example, we may not be able to sufficiently verify your identity based on the information you provide to us in response to our verification process. In such instances, we will provide you with a written explanation as to the reason we cannot process your request.
In some cases, we may suggest that you receive the most recent or a summary of your personal information and give you the opportunity to elect whether to receive the rest of your personal information. We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive personal information.
The CCPA contains several exemptions which may impact State Farm’s obligation to comply with any request made pursuant to CCPA. State Farm retains the right to apply any of the exemptions provided under CCPA to any request, at any time.

Washington Privacy Rights
Washington protected individual - confidentiality request
Washington Insurance Law 284-04-510 requires any company that issues, delivers, amends, or renews an individual accident and health insurance policy (including a disability insurance policy) to accommodate a reasonable request by a covered person to receive communications that contain protected health information* by alternative means or at alternative locations regardless of who pays for the plan. If a child under the age of 18 is a covered person, then the right established by the above section may be asserted by the child's parent or guardian.
Accordingly, if you are a resident of the state of Washington, you have the right to have protected health information sent to you instead of the person who pays for your health insurance plan. In Washington state, sensitive health care services** are required to be confidential, but if you have not requested this information to be sent to a different address or by another means, this information will be sent in your name to the address on file. You can ask to be contacted about protected health information and sensitive health services:

A Good Neighbor is a Green Neighbor™
Go paperless
Description of applicable insurance law
New York State Insurance Law § 2612 and related regulations establish provisions for persons insured by an individual insurance policy issued to another person (the "policyholder") or a group insurance policy. This law and the related regulations place requirements on insurance companies, such as State Farm®, when the insurance companies are provided with a valid Order of Protection against the policyholder or another person covered under a group insurance policy. For the duration of the Order of Protection, the insurance company is prohibited from disclosing the address and telephone number of the insured or of any person or entity providing services to the insured, to the policyholder or another person covered by a group insurance policy. If a child is the insured, this right may be asserted by the child's parent or legal guardian.
In addition, an insurer may not discriminate against a person solely because he or she has been a victim of domestic violence.
Additional information
State Farm insurance affiliates will accommodate a request made by a person covered by insurance to receive communications of claim related information from State Farm at an alternative address or by an alternative means if such person clearly states that the disclosure of information could endanger himself or herself. If the covered person is a child, then the child's parent or legal guardian may make the request to State Farm. Except with the express consent of the person making the request, State Farm will be prohibited from disclosing to the policyholder or other person the:
address, telephone number, or any other personally identifying information of the covered person and any child residing with the covered person;
nature of the health care services provided to the covered person; or
name or address of the provider of the covered services to the covered person.
To initiate or revoke a request
To initiate a request to ensure the necessary confidentiality of information as it relates to a valid order of protection or a reasonable request for the use of an alternate address or an alternative means of communication:
Send a copy of the order of protection; and/or
Complete, sign and send the

Washington Consumer Health Data Privacy Notice
We value your privacy.
This State Farm® Washington Consumer Health Data Privacy Notice describes how we collect, use, and disclose consumer health data of Washington consumers and the rights prescribed by the Washington My Health My Data Act (WMHMDA).
This notice applies only to consumers as defined by the My Health My Data Act. The Act defines a consumer as “a natural person who is a Washington resident; or (b) a natural person whose consumer health data is collected in Washington.” A consumer as defined is an “natural person acting only in an individual or household context” and does not include an “individual acting in an employment context.”
This notice does not apply to individuals acting in an employment context, including current and former employees of State Farm.
Your consumer health data covered by this notice may also be protected by other laws such as the Financial Services Modernization Act [also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)], the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and where applicable, those laws primarily govern how we use and disclose consumer health data. The WMHMDA does not apply to consumer health data protected by these and other privacy laws. Our privacy notices concerning personal information including consumer health data, protected by
state
laws, as well as by
GLBA
and
HIPAA

website
