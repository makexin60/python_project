C. Core automated processes
Uber uses automated processes to enable certain parts of our services, including functions essential to our business such as matching, pricing and fraud prevention and detection.
Uber relies on automated processes to enable essential parts of our services, including matching (pairing users requesting and providing transportation and/or delivery services), pricing (calculating the amount owed for such services) and fraud detection and prevention. These processes allow Uber to provide a seamless, and safe, experience to millions of users globally every day.
This section describes how automated matching, pricing, and fraud prevention and detection processes work, including how they impact your Uber experience and the personal and non-personal data used to enable these processes.
You may contact Uber
here
if you have questions or concerns regarding these processes.
1. Matching
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms to efficiently match Riders and drivers, or delivery people and Order Recipients. This helps us minimize wait times for you, and enable efficiency for drivers and delivery people.
The matching process is triggered when you request transportation or deliveries through Uber. Our algorithms then evaluate various factors to determine the best match, including your location, requested destination, the proximity and availability of drivers or delivery people, traffic conditions, and historical data (including, in some markets, whether the specific Rider and driver have previously reported having negative experiences with each other).
The trip or delivery request is then communicated to the driver/delivery person matched through this process. Once a trip or order is accepted, we send confirmation of the match to you and the driver/delivery person.
We are constantly refining our matching process to provide the best experience to all users on our platform and may consider different factors depending on the location where you use Uber.
Additional information on Uber’s matching process is available
here
.
2. Pricing
Down Small
When you request transportation or a delivery, Uber uses algorithms to determine the price you pay based on a variety of factors, including:
The type of service you request (for instance, UberX, UberXL, Uber Black)
Your location
Estimated time and distance to destination
Availability and proximity of drivers or delivery people
Time of day
Traffic conditions
Historical data such as traffic patterns and seasonal trends.
Your price may also vary depending on tolls or surcharges incurred, tips, discounts, promotions and subscriptions, and route-based adjustments.
The price may also vary depending on surge pricing, which automatically goes into effect when there are more Riders in a given area than available drivers. This encourages more drivers to serve the busy area over time and shifts Rider demand, to maintain reliability and restore balance.
Additional information on Uber’s pricing process is available
here
.
3. Fraud prevention and detection
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms and machine learning models to prevent and detect fraud against Uber or our users. This includes efforts to monitor for account takeovers, suspicious user behaviors, and unauthorized access attempts, including by third-party aggregators.
These tools look for patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, such as those that vary significantly from typical user behavior. To do this, Uber performs real-time monitoring of information collected from or generated by users, including location data, payment information, and Uber usage. We also examine historical data and compare it against real-time data to help detect suspicious behavior.
Uber may limit your access to its services, or require that you undertake a particular action such as verifying your identity before allowing such access, if it detects potential fraudulent activity.
You may contact Uber customer support
here
if you have questions or concerns about these processes.

B. Our legal bases for using your data
Depending on where you use our services, and our purpose for using your data, Uber relies on the following legal bases for processing your data:
Necessity to perform our contract with you
Consent
Uber's legitimate interests
Legal obligation
Data protection laws in some countries and areas, including the EEA, UK, Switzerland, Brazil and Nigeria, only allow Uber to use your data when certain circumstances defined under those laws apply. This is called having a “legal basis” for using your data. The applicability of these legal bases may depend on your location. The chart below indicates the legal bases that Uber has under those laws when they do apply, and it uses your data for the purposes described in this notice.
Legal basis
Description
Data uses
Contract
When you set up your Uber account and/or request a ride or delivery from Uber, we are entering into a contract defined by our
Terms and Conditions
to provide you those services.
This legal basis applies when we must use your data in order to provide the services you request and meet our responsibilities under that contract.

Uber's Privacy Principles
When you use Uber’s services, you trust us with your personal data. We’re committed to keeping that trust, and that starts with helping you understand our privacy practices. Our Privacy Principles set the foundation for how we approach privacy at Uber.
We do the right thing with data.
Responsible data management is a prerequisite for continuous innovation. We maintain the value of personal data for Uber and our users by handling data as users expect, keeping it accurate and complete, and properly destroying it when it is no longer needed. This improves our products, earns and keeps our users’ trust, and differentiates us in the market.
We build privacy into our products from start to finish.
Privacy is an important component for building world-class products and services, from inception to rollout and beyond. Performing privacy reviews on new and changed products, technologies, and services makes sure they fulfill users’ expectations and forms the bedrock of an exceptional customer experience. This is called “privacy-by-design.”
We collect only what we need.
We have a specific objective in mind when collecting, using, or handling personal data that is consistent with our objectives and values. We collect and use only the amount of personal data we need for approved and lawful purposes.
We are transparent about our data practices.
We are forthright about the personal data we collect and how we’re using and sharing it. We do what we say.
We give users choices about their data.
We give users clear choices about their privacy and controls that are easy to use so that they can manage their data.
We safeguard personal data.
We provide reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent loss, and unauthorized use or disclosure, of personal data.
Take control of your privacy
Visit our Privacy Center to make choices about how we use your data, explore privacy products and manage your privacy settings.

How we use your information
Uber puts transportation, food delivery, and other services at your fingertips. Understanding what data we collect and how we use it should be just as easy.

C. Core automated processes
Uber uses automated processes to enable certain parts of our services, including functions essential to our business such as matching, pricing and fraud prevention and detection.
Uber relies on automated processes to enable essential parts of our services, including matching (pairing users requesting and providing transportation and/or delivery services), pricing (determining the amount you are owed for providing such services), safety and fraud detection and prevention. These processes allow Uber to provide a seamless and safe experience to millions of users globally every day.
This section describes how automated matching, pricing, safety, and fraud prevention and detection work, including how they impact your Uber experience and the personal and non-personal data used to enable these processes.
You may contact Uber
here
if you have questions or concerns regarding these processes.
1. Matching
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms and machine learning models to efficiently match riders and Drivers, or Delivery People and order recipients.
The matching process is triggered when riders or delivery recipients request transportation or deliveries through Uber. Our algorithms then evaluate various factors to determine the best match for a given trip or delivery request based on the available Drivers/Delivery People in the area. These factors include your location, proximity to the rider/order recipient, requested destination, traffic conditions, and historical data (including, in some markets, whether you and the rider have previously reported having negative experiences with each other).
The trip or delivery request is then communicated to you and other Drivers/Delivery Persons matched through this process. Once a ride or delivery is accepted, we send confirmation of the match to the Driver/Delivery Person and the rider/order recipient.
We continually refine our matching process to provide the best experience to all users on our platform, and may consider different factors depending on where you use Uber.
Additional information on Uber’s matching process is available
here
.
2. Pricing
Down Small
When you provide transportation or a delivery, Uber uses algorithms to determine the amount you’re paid. If you are in a city where the fare is calculated per minute and per mile, you’ll earn a base fare plus additional money for the time and distance you travel (these rates vary by city). If you are in a city where Uber provides an upfront fare that you can review before determining whether to accept the ride or delivery, such fares are calculated based on factors including the current driving conditions, similar destinations, demand for rides at that time, surcharges and reimbursement for tolls, surge pricing and promotions. Uber’s service fees are subtracted from all fares.
Additional information on Uber’s pricing process is available
here
(Drivers) and
here
(Delivery People).
3. Safety, security, and fraud prevention and detection
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms and machine learning models to prevent and detect safety incidents or fraud against Uber or our users. This includes efforts to monitor for account takeovers, unauthorized account sharing, altered or false document submissions, duplicate or fake accounts and other suspicious user behaviors.
For example, Uber uses identity verification tools, like
Real-Time ID Check
, to help verify that your account is being used by you and not someone pretending to be you. The Real-Time ID Check process requires Drivers/Delivery People to occasionally take a real-time selfie before going online. Where permitted by law, we may also use facial recognition technology to compare your selfie to your profile photo to verify that you are the person using your account, and that it is not being used by other people.
We also use automated processes to validate your ID documents and profile photo associated with your account. These include checks to verify that (1) the driver’s license you submit at or after onboarding is valid, unaltered, and not associated with any other account; and (2) the profile photo you submit is of a real person and isn’t digitally altered, manipulated or associated with any other account.*
If these processes flag your documents or photos as potentially fraudulent or not a match, specialized customer support agents will manually review them. If these agents determine that the documents or photos are invalid, don’t match or are otherwise noncompliant, your account may be deactivated. You have the right to appeal deactivation of your account. Please go
here
for more information on Uber’s deactivation process.
Uber also uses tools that look for patterns that may indicate fraudulent or unsafe behavior, such as those which vary significantly from typical user behavior. To do this, Uber performs real-time monitoring of information collected from or generated by users, including location data, payment information and Uber usage. We also examine historical data and compare it against real-time data to help detect suspicious behavior.
Uber may limit your access to our services, or require that you undertake a particular action such as verifying your identity before allowing such access, if Uber detects potential fraudulent or unsafe activity.
You may contact Uber Support
here
if you have questions or concerns about these processes.

C. Core automated processes
Uber uses automated processes to enable certain parts of our services, including functions essential to our business such as matching, pricing and fraud prevention and detection.
Uber relies on automated processes to enable essential parts of our services, including matching (pairing users requesting and providing transportation and/or delivery services), pricing (calculating the amount owed for such services) and fraud detection and prevention. These processes allow Uber to provide a seamless, and safe, experience to millions of users globally every day.
This section describes how automated matching, pricing, and fraud prevention and detection processes work, including how they impact your Uber experience and the personal and non-personal data used to enable these processes.
You may contact Uber
here
if you have questions or concerns regarding these processes.
1. Matching
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms to efficiently match Riders and drivers, or delivery people and Order Recipients. This helps us minimize wait times for you, and enable efficiency for drivers and delivery people.
The matching process is triggered when you request transportation or deliveries through Uber. Our algorithms then evaluate various factors to determine the best match, including your location, requested destination, the proximity and availability of drivers or delivery people, traffic conditions, and historical data (including, in some markets, whether the specific Rider and driver have previously reported having negative experiences with each other).
The trip or delivery request is then communicated to the driver/delivery person matched through this process. Once a trip or order is accepted, we send confirmation of the match to you and the driver/delivery person.
We are constantly refining our matching process to provide the best experience to all users on our platform and may consider different factors depending on the location where you use Uber.
Additional information on Uber’s matching process is available
here
.
2. Pricing
Down Small
When you request transportation or a delivery, Uber uses algorithms to determine the price you pay based on a variety of factors, including:
The type of service you request (for instance, UberX, UberXL, Uber Black)
Your location
Estimated time and distance to destination
Availability and proximity of drivers or delivery people
Time of day
Traffic conditions
Historical data such as traffic patterns and seasonal trends.
Your price may also vary depending on tolls or surcharges incurred, tips, discounts, promotions and subscriptions, and route-based adjustments.
The price may also vary depending on surge pricing, which automatically goes into effect when there are more Riders in a given area than available drivers. This encourages more drivers to serve the busy area over time and shifts Rider demand, to maintain reliability and restore balance.
Additional information on Uber’s pricing process is available
here
.
3. Fraud prevention and detection
Down Small
Uber uses algorithms and machine learning models to prevent and detect fraud against Uber or our users. This includes efforts to monitor for account takeovers, suspicious user behaviors, and unauthorized access attempts, including by third-party aggregators.
These tools look for patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, such as those that vary significantly from typical user behavior. To do this, Uber performs real-time monitoring of information collected from or generated by users, including location data, payment information, and Uber usage. We also examine historical data and compare it against real-time data to help detect suspicious behavior.
Uber may limit your access to its services, or require that you undertake a particular action such as verifying your identity before allowing such access, if it detects potential fraudulent activity.
You may contact Uber customer support
here
if you have questions or concerns about these processes.
