Each Client Affiliate will be invoiced separately. Should the Parties agree to allow Client to pay in a currency other than USD, GBP or EUR, Client shall be charged an additional 0.15% on the invoiced amount.
Late Payment; Disputes

Taxes
. All fees are exclusive of taxes and duties. If the Services are subject to collection or payment of any federal, state, or local tax under the Agreement, or any other similar taxes or duties levied by any governmental authority, excluding taxes levied on Riskified’s net income, then such taxes and/or duties shall be invoiced to and paid solely by Client upon receipt of invoice.

Early Termination Fee
”), which will be reduced by any and all credits owed to Client in the final invoice.

Vendor Code of Conduct
Riskified Ltd. (“Riskified” ) strives to achieve the highest standard of business and professional integrity, and seeks to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. We expect our vendors, suppliers, distributors, partners, business associates, and third party representatives (“
Vendors
” ) to uphold these standards of conduct and professional integrity and communicate them to their organization.
This Vendor Code of Conduct (“Code”) sets forth Riskified’s expectation that its Vendors uphold the highest standards of ethics and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
These expectations should complement each Vendor’s own company policies, applicable legal requirements, and the terms of any agreements that a Vendor may have with Riskified. Failure to comply with this Code could result in termination of the business relationship. Riskified encourages Vendors to raise questions or concerns about this Code to their Riskified point of contact.
Riskified’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets forth our compliance standards in more detail, is available at
https://ir.riskified.com/corporate-governance/documents-charters
Riskified expects its Vendors to be honest, ethical and transparent when dealing with Riskified, its employees, customers and other third parties.
Vendors are expected to monitor Vendors own compliance with this Code and report any integrity concern or violations of this Code or otherwise involving or affecting Riskified. When requested, Vendors are expected to assist Riskified in investigating concerns.
Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations
Riskified expects its Vendors to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to the Vendor’s business, particularly those related to Vendor’s performance of duties for Riskified.
Anti-corruption compliance & business expenses
Riskified prohibits bribes, kickbacks, or other improper or illegal payments of anything of value from being directly or indirectly offered, paid, promised or authorized in any way related to Riskified, whether it involves public officials (including officers or employees of governments or state-owned entities) or private parties.
Riskified also prohibits bribery to influence a public official, to obtain or retain business from any party, or to secure an unfair business advantage.
Riskified also prohibits Vendors from making facilitation payments, or small, unofficial payments to public officials to expedite routine, non-discretionary government processes or decisions (even if permissible under local law).
All business expenses provided by Vendors related to Riskified’s business – including gifts (whether money or any other thing of value), hospitality, entertainment, events, travel, or accommodation – must comply with any agreements with Riskified; have a legitimate business purpose; be reasonable and modest in value and frequency; comply with local law; and be accurately recorded. Riskified prohibits the provision of cash gifts.
Export, customs, trade control, and anti-money laundering
Riskified expects its Vendors to comply with all applicable export, customs, and trade control laws and regulations, including economic and trade sanctions laws, antiboycott laws, and any related licensing requirements.
Riskified also expects its Vendors to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Conflicts of interest & corporate opportunities
Vendors should avoid actual or potential business or financial conflicts of interest – i.e., instances where the Vendor’s personal interests (including interests of the Vendor itself or the Vendor’s employees, officers, or directors) interfere or appear to interfere with Riskified’s interests.
Vendors are prohibited from directly or indirectly (a) taking personally for themselves opportunities that are discovered through the use of Riskified property, information or positions; (b) using Riskified property, information or positions for personal gain; or (c) competing with Riskified for business opportunities.
Any actual or potential conflicts of interest must be immediately reported to Riskified.
Insider trading
As a Vendor of Riskified, you may have access to material non-public information about Riskified, other companies, or their respective subsidiaries.
Vendors may not purchase or sell any type of security while in possession of “material nonpublic information” relating to the security or the issuer of such security, whether the issuer of such security is Riskified or any other company. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, sell, or hold a security, or if the fact is likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the security.
Riskified prohibits its Vendors from “tipping” others (e.g., family or friends) regarding material nonpublic information about securities.
Antitrust, competition, and fair dealing
Riskified expects its Vendors to comply with applicable antitrust and competition laws designed to promote fair and open competition, particularly as it relates to Riskified.
Vendors should not directly or indirectly enter into any formal or informal agreement with competitors that fixes or controls prices, divides or allocates markets, limits the production or sale of products, boycotts certain suppliers or customers, eliminates competition or otherwise unreasonably restrains trade.
Vendors are expected to deal fairly with customers, service providers, suppliers, competitors and employees.
Vendors should not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair dealing practice.
Record management and recording transactions
Vendors are expected to ensure that all financial books, records and accounts related to their relationship with Riskified accurately reflect transactions and events.
Vendors should not falsify documents, transactions, or accounting records.
Confidential information
We expect our Vendors to safeguard and protect Riskified’s confidential information, as well as the confidential information of Riskified’s customers, suppliers, shareholders, Riskified employees, or other third parties. Confidential information should be interpreted broadly to include all non-public information relating to Riskified or other companies that would be harmful to the relevant company (or useful to competitors) if disclosed, including financial results or prospects, information provided by a third party, trade secrets, new product or marketing plans, research and development ideas, manufacturing processes, potential acquisitions or investments, or information of use to the Riskified’s competitors or harmful to Riskified or its customers if disclosed.
Riskified prohibits its Vendors from misusing proprietary information or trade secret information that was obtained without the owner’s consent; or from using confidential information for personal gain.
Data privacy
Vendors should comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal information or other sensitive or protected information, and assist Riskified in complying with its own obligations in this regard Vendors’ privacy policies and notices should accurately reflect the data processing activities carried out by the Vendor, and should at all times be consistent with the processes by which data flows between Vendors and Riskified.
Riskified expects its Vendors to notify Riskified immediately in the event of an actual or suspected data breach resulting in the dissemination of personal information relating to Riskified or its subsidiaries, customers, management, employees or other related parties, and of the steps Vendors are taking to address the breach.
Riskified expects its Vendors to review and comply with Riskified’s Privacy Policy available at
https://www.riskified.com/terms/
.
Human rights, employee relations and non-discrimination
We expect our Vendors to comply with all applicable human rights laws prohibiting child, forced, indentured, or involuntary labor.
Riskified expects its Vendors to pay wages in compliance with applicable minimum wage laws, respect maximum working hour standards and provide benefits in compliance with all applicable laws.
Riskified also expects its Vendors to conduct themselves in a professional manner with courtesy and respect for others. Riskified will not tolerate harassment by our Vendors in any form, including verbal, physical, or sexual harassment.
Riskified is committed to providing equal opportunities in employment, development, and advancement for all qualified persons and to promoting diversity and inclusion – and our Vendors are expected to share that commitment. Riskified does not tolerate illegal discrimination or harassment of any kind by its Vendors.
Environment, safety, and health
Riskified expects its Vendors to manage and operate in a manner protective of human health, safety, and the environment, especially as it relates to Vendors work with Riskified.
Riskified expects its Vendors to comply with both the letter and spirit of the applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and to attempt to develop a cooperative attitude with government inspection and enforcement officials.
Use and protection of riskified corporate assets
