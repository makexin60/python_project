This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how Evoke - AI Photo Enhancer (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “we,” “us,” or “our”), as the developer of the mobile application (the “App”), collects information when you use the App. This Policy also explains how we use and disclose the information we collect from you, and your rights in relation to that information.
This app requests some sensitive permission to make the in-app functions work properly. Photos/Media/Files, Storage, and other permissions may only be needed for enhancing, editing, or saving photos or other media files with the application.
Photos/Media/Files permission: To get the photos or other media files to be enhanced or edited on your device as needed.
Storage permission: To save the enhanced or edited photos in your local media as needed. Please note that we never automatically obtain any photos from your device, nor will we save your photos on our server.
We assure our users that any user data obtained through these permissions will not be shared or distributed without the user's express consent, except as required by law. We take the privacy and security of our users' data very seriously and are committed to complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulations.
You can read more about the details of our Privacy Policy in the following sections.

3. Information We Collect
A. Cookies & Similar Tracking Technologies. We use “cookies” and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your use of the Service and to provide you with interest-based advertising. For example, we collect information about the way you interact with features on our Site, how long you spend on certain pages, and whether you received an error message on our Service. For more information, please check this privacy policy of the relevant services.
B. Device Information. We collect information about the device you use to access or use our Service. For example, we may collect the following information from your device: the type of device you use (e.g., mobile, auto, a smart home device, etc.); your advertising Identifier (“IDFA” or “AdID”); network connection type (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, 3G, 4G, LTE, etc.); operating system and version (e.g., iOS, Android or Windows); language settings in your mobile device; and your mobile service carrier.
C. Media Information. We may collect media information about you from third-party applications or services available on our Service. For example, when you register for an account with us, you may do so by choosing to connect your already existing social media account with our Service (e.g., Facebook, Google+, etc.). We receive certain information from your social media account depending on your permissions and which information you have made public. We use this information to make an account for you on our Service. Also, we might collect and share your data with social media or other similar platforms, as well as our advertising partners, so that you and other people can see relevant advertising on that platform. For example, we may use the Facebook Custom Audiences service and share your IDFA with Facebook so that we can: serve relevant advertising to you or include you in a custom audience that we will serve relevant advertising to you on Facebook; or create an audience of other Facebook users based on the information in your Facebook profile. You can opt out from Facebook Custom Audiences in your Facebook privacy settings, for example, and other similar platforms may have equivalent opt-out settings.
D. Certain Permission this app may require:
Photos/Media/Files permission: To get the photos or other media files to be enhanced or edited on your device as needed.

We assure our users that any user data obtained through this permission will not be shared or distributed without the user's express consent, except as required by law. We take the privacy and security of our users' data very seriously and are committed to complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulations.
E. Face Data
Evoke's photo enhancement and photo generative technologies don't perform facial biometric recognition activities. These technologies also don’t attempt or allow the identification or authentication of people in the images.
What face data does our app collect?
When images contain faces, we process certain information about them, including estimating the spatial location of facial features (such as the eyes, nose, or mouth) and locating different facial regions ("Face Data").
How do we use the collected face data?
Facial restoration
When users use the in-app feature Enhance, Colorize, or Descratch after giving consent to upload their photos or images, the facial data will be used to estimate the face range, redraw within the estimated facial range, supplement facial details, and repair facial image damage to make it clear.
Facial replacement
When users use the in-app feature AI Portraits to generate their own portraits after giving consent to upload their photos or images, the facial data will be used to estimate the face range, replace the corresponding face range in the template image with users' facial image information, then generate a new image with similar facial information to the original image.
Will the data be shared with any third parties? Where will this information be stored?
All the face data will not be shared with any third parties. The information will be temporarily stored in our Amazon S3 server which will be automatically deleted within 48 hours.
How long will face data be retained?
To protect your privacy, we ensure that all the face data both contained in the photos you upload and the restored/generated images processed through our app are automatically deleted within 48 hours. Our commitment to privacy protection remains steadfast, providing you with peace of mind when using our services.
Complete details on each type of personal data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data collection.

If you are a California resident, please review our
California Resident Privacy Notice
("CCPA") for information regarding your California privacy rights.
Transfer to Third Countries
If personal data is being transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area, we only transfer it to third countries where the EU Commission has confirmed an adequate level of protection or where we can ensure the careful handling of personal data by means of contractual agreements (Standard Contract Clauses) or other suitable guarantees, such as certifications or proven compliance with international security standards. Information on this is available from us upon request.
Data Privacy Framework
Adjust Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Adjust Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, Adjust Inc. commits to cooperate and comply with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, Adjust Inc. commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF should first contact Adjust Inc. at:
privacy@adjust.com
If you are an EU individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see below) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Choice: If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Policy, Adjust will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of Personal Data should be sent to us at
privacy@adjust.com
2. Tracking Technologies on our Website
Google Analytics
We use the Google Analytics service of the provider Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland on our website.
Google Analytics is a web analytics service that allows us to collect and analyze data about the behavior of visitors to our website. Google Analytics uses cookies for this purpose, which enable an analysis of the use of our website. This involves processing of personal data in the form of online identifiers (including cookie identifiers), IP addresses, device identifiers and information about interaction with our website.
Some of this data is information that is stored in the terminal device you are using. In addition, further information is also stored on your end device via the cookies used. Such storage of information by Google Analytics or access to information that is already stored in your terminal device only takes place with your consent.
Google Ireland will process the data collected in this way on our behalf in order to evaluate the use of our website by the users, to compile reports on the activities within our website and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our website and the use of the internet. In doing so, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.
The personal data processed on our behalf to provide Google Analytics may be transferred to any country in which Google Ireland or Google Ireland's sub-processors maintain facilities. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries".
In addition to the option to reject Google Analytics in our Consent Banner, you can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google Ireland within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the IP address be transferred to Google on a server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other data. You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
We use the Google Analytics 4 variant, which allows us to track interaction data from different devices and from different sessions. This allows us to put individual user actions in context and analyze long-term relationships.
The data about user actions are stored for a period of 14 months and then automatically deleted. All other event data is stored for 2 months and are then automatically deleted. Thereby, the deletion of the data whose storage period has expired takes place automatically once a month.
Google Ads
We use the online advertising program Google Ads of Google Ireland, Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”) on our website, through which we place advertisements on the Google search engine. When you access our website via a Google ad, Google sets a cookie on your terminal device ("conversion cookie"). In the process, a different conversion cookie is assigned to each Google Ads customer, so that the cookies are not tracked across the websites of different Ads customers. The information obtained with the help of the cookie is used to create conversion statistics. This tells us the total number of users who clicked on one of our Google ads. However, we do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified. When using the service, a transfer of your data to the USA cannot be excluded. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries". You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
Google Remarketing
We also use the Google Analytics advertising features (remarketing) from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This function enables us, in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google, to display advertisements in a more targeted manner and to present users with ads that are tailored to their interests. Via the remarketing, users are shown ads and products for which interest has been identified on other websites in the Google network. The function allows us to link advertising target groups created via Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device functions of Google Ads. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to a user depending on previous usage and surfing behavior on an end device (e.g. cell phone) can also be displayed on another end device of the user (e.g. tablet or PC).
If you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history with your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be placed on every end device on which you log in with your Google account. The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based solely on your consent, which you can give or withdraw at Google. For these linked services, data is then collected via Google Analytics for advertising purposes. To support the remarketing function, Google Analytics collects users' Google-authenticated IDs, which are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data. This is used to define and create target groups for cross-device ad advertising.

https://support.google.com/My-Ad-Center-Help/answer/12155451?hl=en&sjid=174251308182856932-EU
.
Google Signals
We use the Signals feature of Google Analytics, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Signals recognises individual users using different devices (so-called cross-device tracking). We only receive anonymous data in the form of a report that shows patterns in user behaviour. Google Signals helps us to better understand how visitors interact with our website and to show more meaningful and personalized ads to these visitors after leaving our website.
For this, session data is being processed and linked with website visitors that
• have a Google account;
• are logged in to their Google account when they access the corresponding website; and
• have turned on the “Ads personalization” feature in their Google account.
If you do not wish to be subject to the Signals feature, you can deactivate the “Ads personalization” feature in your Google account.
The privacy policy of Google can be found here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en
Meta Pixel (formerly known as Facebook Pixel)
We use the "visitor action pixels" from Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Meta") on our website. This allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to our website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Meta, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Meta may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with
Facebook's Data Usage Policy
. You can allow Meta and its partners to place ads on and off Facebook. A cookie may also be stored on your computer for these purposes. You can object to the collection of your data by Meta pixel, or to the use of your data for the purpose of displaying Facebook ads in your account-settings. You can find Meta's privacy policy here:

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.

Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;

Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information

Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments.

Advertising Partners.

This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data

U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.

Mobile Ads SDK (Android)
Google Play's data disclosure requirements
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In May 2021, Google Play
announced the new Data safety
section
,
which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing,
and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in
regards to your usage of the Google Mobile Ads SDK. On this page, you can find
information on whether and how our SDK handles end-user data, including any
applicable settings or configurations you can control as the app developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app
developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google
Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection,
sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest version

(version
24.1.0
) of the
Google Mobile Ads SDK.
If you are using a prior version of the Google Mobile Ads SDK, consider
updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate.
The Google Mobile Ads SDK will continue to be updated over time. This page
reflects these changes, so make sure to check back and update your disclosures
as necessary.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's
guide about data
types
to help you
determine which
data
types
and
purposes
best describe the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also
account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
Data collected and shared automatically
The Google Mobile Ads SDK collects and shares the following data types
automatically
for

advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes.
Data
By default, the Google Mobile Ads SDK...
IP address
Collects device's IP address, which may be used to estimate the general
    location of a device.
User product interactions
Collects user product interactions and interaction information, including
    app launch, taps, and video views.
Diagnostic information
Collects information related to the performance of your app and the SDK,
    including
     
     crash logs,
     
     app launch time, hang rate, and energy usage.
Device and Account identifiers
Collects
Android
    advertising (ad) ID
,
app set ID
,
    and, if applicable, other identifiers related to signed-in accounts on the
    device.
All of the user data collected by Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in
transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
Data handling
Android ad ID collection is optional. The ad ID can be reset or deleted by users
using ad ID controls in the Android settings menu. As the app developer, you can
prevent the collection of ad IDs by
updating the app's manifest
file
.
Certain other features in the Google Mobile Ads SDK, such as the
Limited Ads
feature, may also disable transmission of the ad ID and other data.
Data collected and shared depending on your usage
If you are using any optional product features that involve additional data
(such as advance reporting) or participating in any tests of new product
features that involve additional data, be sure to check if those features or
tests require additional data disclosures.
