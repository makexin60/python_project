Appendix 1:
Obligations under GDPR Laws for EU Citizens
Context re Data storage and transfer:
GDPR
applies because the regulation extends its reach to any organisation, regardless of location, that processes personal data of individuals in the European Union when monitoring their behaviour.
Data Transfers and Storage;
Simply stating that data is stored on secure servers is not sufficient to meet the
GDPR
requirements for data transfers, particularly when data is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA). GDPR imposes strict rules on international data transfers, requiring organisations to ensure that the data is afforded an equivalent level of protection as it would within the EEA.
To comply with GDPR, a privacy policy must specify the safeguards or mechanisms in place for protecting personal data when it’s transferred to countries outside the EEA. These safeguards typically include:
Adequacy Decisions
: Indicating whether the data is transferred to countries that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection (e.g., Australia does not have such a decision).
Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
: If the data is transferred to a country without an adequacy decision, the policy should mention that Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the European Commission) are used to ensure appropriate safeguards.
Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
: If the organisation has adopted Binding Corporate Rules, these should be mentioned as a safeguard for internal transfers of personal data within a corporate group.
Other Approved Safeguards
: Any other GDPR-compliant mechanisms, such as certification mechanisms, codes of conduct, or explicit consent, can also be referenced.
An example compliant clause would be:
“Our organisation may transfer your personal data to third parties located in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). In such cases, we ensure that appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, are in place to protect your personal data. You may request further details on these safeguards by contacting us.”
Advice: If you would like to undertake an investigation of this are of privacy laws, it would be best to set up a call to discuss further.
