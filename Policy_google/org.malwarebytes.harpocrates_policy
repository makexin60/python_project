Why do you need
Malwarebytes Privacy VPN?
What is a
VPN
and what does it
protect you
from?
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) send your internet activity through a secure private tunnel, shielding it from hackers, scammers, and eavesdroppers who may be tracking you.
Why do I need both
Antivirus and VPN?
Antiviruses and VPNs work hand in hand to keep your digital life safe.  AVs protect your devices by scanning to find stop and remove malicious software. VPNs help you keep your online activity private from hackers, governments, and more.
