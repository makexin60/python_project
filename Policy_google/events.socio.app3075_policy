Use of cookies and similar technologies
Cisco uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, pixels, tags, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to us (such as Internet Protocol [IP] address, MAC address, clickstream behavior, and telemetry).
These tools help make your visit to our websites and Solutions easier, more efficient, and personalized. We also use the information to improve our websites and Solutions, provide greater service and value, better understand your potential interest in our websites and Solutions, and provide you with more relevant ads and other content.
We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. Where this type of third party advertising is disabled, generic, non-personalized ads will continue to be displayed.

Automated decision-making
We process Personal Data using both manual and automated methods of processing. Automated methods are often used to assist our manual methods in accordance with applicable laws.

Manual review may be conducted by Cisco employees or trusted third-party business partners working on Cisco's behalf.
Linked websites and third-party Apps
We may provide access or links to third-party websites, Apps, and services that are outside Cisco's control and governed by the respective third party’s privacy policy, not by this Privacy Statement.

Questions, comments, and how to contact us
section and we will take appropriate measures to investigate and address the issue promptly.
International transfer, processing, and storage of Personal Data

California Shine the Light
Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Data during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt out or opt in choice for use of your Personal Data by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
Cisco has a comprehensive Privacy Statement and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Data by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain nor disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Data for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

7. Definitions
1. Purpose
Cisco is committed to protecting the privacy of Personal Data of its Workers, Customers, business partners, and other individuals. Cisco has, therefore, implemented a global privacy program to establish and maintain high standards for creating, collecting, using, disclosing, storing, securing, accessing, transferring, or otherwise processing Personal Data. This Global Privacy Policy is the foundation of that program and describes the approach taken by Cisco when processing Personal Data worldwide.
2. Scope
All Cisco employees, contractors, vendors, consultants, temporary agency workers, and other agents of any Cisco Group Company ("Cisco Workers") must comply with this Policy, including all personnel affiliated with third parties who may have access to any Cisco network or resource, including cloud-based services, hosted inside or outside of Cisco.
This Global Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies globally to Personal Data that Cisco processes, whether by electronic or non-electronic means (e.g., paper, or analog form). This Policy applies to any Personal Data Processing that is done for or by Cisco.
With respect to People Data and Business Personal Data specifically, this Global Privacy Policy is supplemented by the Cisco Global People Data Protection Policy, European People Data Protection Policy, and the Cisco Business Personal Data Privacy Policy. These internal policy documents describe in more detail how this Global Privacy Policy applies to People Data and Business Personal Data, respectively, and provide guidance to Cisco Workers on the proper handling of Personal Data.
3. Policy Statements
3.1 Adequate Safeguards for Processing of Personal Data
In conjunction with the Global People Data Protection Policy, the European People Data Protection Policy, and the Business Personal Data Privacy Policy, this Global Privacy Policy is also intended to provide adequate safeguards for the processing of Personal Data entrusted to Cisco and transferred from countries requiring such protections. This is to help enable Cisco to transfer Personal Data wherever it is needed globally to support its internal business processes or promote services and product functionality and improvement. To do this, the Global People Data Protection Policy, European People Data Protection Policy, and the Business Personal Data Privacy Policy each describe certain additional obligations and legal rights in circumstances where the European Data Protection Law, United Kingdom Data Protection Law, the applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws or requirements in the Americas and/or the Asia-pacific countries or regions’ differ.
3.2 Compliance with Applicable Law
Cisco shall comply with applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws and requirements worldwide.
Where applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws require a higher standard of protection for Personal Data than presented in this Global Privacy Policy, the requirements of applicable personal data protection law shall prevail. Where applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws establish a lower standard of protection for Personal Data than presented in this Global Privacy Policy, the requirements of this Global Privacy Policy shall prevail.
Where Cisco Workers have reason to believe that applicable law prevents Cisco from fulfilling its obligations under this Global Privacy Policy, they shall promptly inform the Privacy Center of Excellence (“PCoE”) and Cisco Legal via the
Privacy Request Form
.
Where there is a conflict between applicable law and this Global Privacy Policy, the Chief Privacy Officer and PCoE Legal shall make a responsible decision regarding what action to take to resolve such a conflict and may consult with the relevant regulatory authority in cases of doubt. This includes resolving conflicts that may arise in the course of business taking place in a third country, which are likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided by this Policy.
3.3 Privacy Principles
The following privacy principles establish Cisco practices for collecting, using, disclosing, storing, securing, accessing, transferring, or otherwise processing Personal Data.
Fairness
Cisco shall process Personal Data in a fair, lawful, legitimate, and transparent manner.
Purpose Limitation
Cisco shall only create or collect Personal Data for a specific, explicit, and legitimate purpose(s). Any subsequent processing shall be compatible with such purpose(s), unless Cisco has obtained the individual’s consent, or the processing is otherwise permitted by applicable law.
Proportionality
Cisco shall only process Personal Data that is adequate, relevant, and not excessive for the purpose(s) for which it is processed.
Data Integrity
Cisco shall keep Personal Data accurate, complete, and up to date as is reasonably necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed.
Data Retention and Disposal
Cisco shall keep Personal Data in a form that is personally identifiable for no longer than necessary to accomplish the purpose(s), for other permitted purpose(s), for which the Personal Data was obtained, or where required by law. Thereafter, it shall either be destroyed, deleted, anonymized, or removed from our systems.
Data Security
Cisco shall implement appropriate and reasonable physical, technical, and organizational measures to safeguard Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, use, or access. Cisco shall instruct and contractually require third parties processing Personal Data on behalf of Cisco, if any, to: (a) process it only for purposes consistent with Cisco's purpose(s) for processing; and (b) implement appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to safeguard the Personal Data.
Individual Rights
Cisco shall process Personal Data in a manner that respects individuals’ rights under applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws.
Accountability
Cisco shall implement appropriate governance, policies, processes, controls, and other measures necessary to enable it to demonstrate that its processing of Personal Data is in accordance with this Global Privacy Policy and applicable Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws.
Cisco as a Processor
In circumstances where Cisco processes Personal Data as a Processor on behalf of a Customer as an integral part of Cisco's provision of its products and services to Customers under the terms of a contractual agreement, Cisco will comply with the Data Security and Accountability Principles set out above. Cisco will also provide reasonable cooperation and, to the extent reasonably possible, assistance to the relevant Customer to facilitate the Customer's compliance with the other Privacy Principles as well as privacy by design and privacy by default.
3.4 Availability of this Policy
Cisco will make this Policy available to data subjects by publishing it on a public-facing Cisco website that is accessible to the data subjects, and in the case of the data subjects being Cisco employees, on a Cisco intranet site that is accessible to the employees.
