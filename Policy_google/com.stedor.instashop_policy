    of the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy, and your state that you are not less than 21 (twenty-one) years
    of age. Registration is free of charge. No entitlement exists for admission to the Service. The data required
    for registration provided by the User must be complete and accurate. The User is responsible for updating
    his/her own data that can be amended at any time from the respective interface of the Service. InstaShop has no
    responsibility over the use of the User account and expressly disclaims any liability therefrom. Should you
    suspect that any unauthorized party might be using your Account, you are obligated for your own security to
    notify InstaShop immediately by emailing us at
contact@instashop.ae
. By providing your mobile phone number to
    InstaShop pursuant to the use of the Service, you hereby affirmatively consent to our use of your mobile phone
    number for contacting you directly in order to perform the Services, including but not limited to occasionally
    send notifications, text messages with promotional offers, service updates and reach out to you to survey
    regarding the quality of our services.
2.2. ORDER PLACEMENT / CONTRACTUAL
    RELATIONSHIP
By placing an order through the
    application or the website, the User confirms the accuracy of all the information he/she provides. Orders are
    confirmed to the User within Service interface. No contractual relationship exists between User and InstaShop.

    schedule the order for a selected time, date, week or month as per availability of Service.
2.3. VARIETY LIMITATIONS
The range and prices of Groceries
    may differ depending on the delivery location.
2.4. VOLUME LIMITATIONS
User might be contacted by
    InstaShop to confirm the order in the following cases:
* If the total items in an order exceed 100 items or if an order contains 15 or more same items
* If the order placed requires more than one delivery personnel to be handled by due to volume
    limitations.
In all cases, InstaShop reserves
    the right to limit the delivery quantity for particular products or, if needed, not to deliver a particular
    product at all as per the availability of the Groceries.
2.5. AMENDING AND CANCELLING
    ORDERS
The User may not be able to amend
    the order once it has been confirmed as per the technical features provided by the Service. A confirmed order is

    per the technical specifications of the Service.
2.6. INCOMPLETE ORDER FULFILLMENT
    / SUBSTITUTION
The primary objective of InstaShop
    is to deliver all the products ordered in the right quantity and to a high quality standard. User acknowledges
    that the Groceries are subject to stock availability and to human errors. InstaShop reserves the right to amend
    your order in whole or in part, at any time and without liability or compensation remove any item that is out of
    stock, damaged, spoiled, or unavailable for any other reason, to successfully complete your order. It’s in
    our best intention to maintain the replaced item’s price the same as per the brand you ordered but in case
    of a higher valued replacement, the price may increase. We do our best to ensure that all items shown on our
    website are available to order. If, however any product you order is out of stock or unavailable we may send you
    a push notification enabling you to select a substitute. If an item is not delivered, despite being billed, the
    amount in question will be credited to the User at a reasonable time after InstaShop becomes aware of this. No
    subsequent delivery is obligatory to be made, and the customer is not entitled to claim any further
    compensation. If for any reason beyond our reasonable control, we are unable to supply a particular item, we
    will not be liable to the User. Please note that we will attempt to send the User push notification of
    substitute products in the event that selected products are unavailable, the User may reject these substitutes.
    Although we will always try to cater for your orders, an order of unusually large quantities of different or one
    product can only be fulfilled at the discretion of the Shop.
InstaShop reserves the right to
    forward a user order to another shop then the one initially selected from the user without informing the user in
    the event that the initial shop fails to fulfil the order. In this case the new shop the total value of the
    goods ordered should be the same or lower than the value as per the pricelist of the initial shop. The payment
    method will remain the same.

4. PRICES AND PAYMENT
InstaShop endeavors to provide you
    with accurate and up-to-date pricing, product availability and promotional information. Discrepancies are
    possible and you agree not to hold InstaShop liable in such instances.
4.1. PRICES
All prices are quoted in the
    country’s local currency where Instashop is operating. For the countries where VAT is applicable the
    prices displayed on the app/website will be VAT inclusive. Where goods may be charged by weight (fruit, meat,
    cheese, etc.), the basic price per unit applies. The quantity of such goods actually delivered, and therefore
    the price charged, may differ from the quantity originally ordered. For pre-packed and price-labelled fresh
    products, the applicable price is the one in force when the order is prepared. InstaShop reserve the right to
    change prices as to update them at any moment.
4.2. ENVIRONMENTAL FEE
According to Law 4819/2021,
    consumers in Greece are required to pay an environmental fee of nine cents (0,09€) per plastic bag, including
    VAT per piece of plastic carrying bag regardless of wall thickness, with the exception of biodegradable and
    compostable plastic carrying bags.

    Moreover, from 1.1.2022 according to Law 4736/2020, consumers are required to pay an environmental fee of five
    cents (0.05 €), including VAT, for each piece of disposable plastic product available as a package of ready-made
    drinks and food in mass catering and retail.

    In all cases, the responsibility for selling and charging the plastic bags as well as the plastic containers
    lies with our partners (Shops) that sell the products and not with Instashop.

    During the submission and delivery of an order, the environmental fees mentioned above are reflected in the
    order’s receipt and are returned, upon completion of the order, to our partners (Shops).
4.3. PAYMENT METHODS /
    CREDITWORTHINESS
You can choose from the following
    ways of paying on delivery, depending on the products, the means of dispatch and as per technical
    availability:
* Credit card reader on delivery
* Cash on delivery
* Online payment
* We accept payments online using Visa, MasterCard and AMEX (valid for UAE only) credit or debit card in the
    currency of the country where the User is located at the time of ordering.
* If you make a payment for our products or services on our website or application, the details you are asked to
    submit will be provided directly to our payment provider via a secured connection.
* The cardholder must retain a copy of transaction records and Merchant policies and rules.
The User can select which payment
    method is preferred. The payment methods available are displayed for selection when the order is finalized. If
    for any reason the online payment transaction is declined, InstaShop is entitled, at its soles discretion, to
    offer the User cash on delivery payment option or credit card reader on delivery where available.
In the event that you have paid
    for an order with Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or another wallet and such payment fails to process, you authorise
    InstaShop to charge the order in any authorised credit card you may have on our platform.
5. PRODUCT DECLARATION
5.1. PRODUCT INFORMATION
We take care to update the product
    information in the Service regularly. In rare cases, the information may deviate from the details printed on the
    product packaging. In such an instance, the information on the packaging takes precedence. Because recipes may
    change anytime, we recommend that you regularly consult the ingredients list and allergy-related information on
    the packaging.
6. GUARANTEE of DATA COMMUNICATION
Given the current state of the
    technology, no guarantee can be given that data communication via the internet will be error-free and/or
    available at all times. InstaShop therefore accepts no liability in respect of the constant, uninterrupted
    availability of the online shop, nor for technical and electronic faults during sales transaction, in particular
    for any delay in processing or accepting orders.
7. SPECIAL PRODUCT CONDITIONS
7.1. PREPAYED MOBILE PHONE
    CREDIT
InstaShop sells mobile phone
    credit of various providers as for example: Etisalat and DU. Mobile phone credit should be activated as soon as
    possible. The activation code is valid only once. No exchanges or refunds are permitted.
8. DISCOUNTS, PRIVILEGES & VOUCHERS
8.1. SPECIAL OFFERS
The User accepts that offers
    available from InstaShop often differ from those available from Shop sales channels.
8.2 INSTAPOINTS
InstaPoints is an innovative way
    of rewarding customers with points in the application or website that can be converted to credit in an upcoming
    grocery order.
The value of 1 InstaPoint is displayed within the application or website and may be modified without prior
    notice and may differ from region to region and from country to country.
Unless otherwise specified, all coupons or codes must be redeemed within one calendar month from the moment they
    are issued/communicated.
InstaPoints coupons cannot be exchanged for cash or any other alternatives and have no monetary value.
InstaPoints may be offered on an ad-hoc basis and will be added to the customer’s account to be used in an
    upcoming grocery order.
InstaPoints can only be redeemed through the application where they are supported and are applicable.
Each InstaPoints coupon can only be used once per user.
InstaPoints can be applied as a discount towards the purchase price of products available on our platform. However, it is important to note that InstaPoints cannot be used to cover any service fees, preparation fees, or delivery charges incurred during the transaction. These fees will remain payable by the user and are not subject to be paid through the redemption of InstaPoints.
If an order, where an InstaPoints coupon has been used, is cancelled for any reason the coupon(s) will be
    reimbursed to the user, either automatically or otherwise upon the user’s request.
If the applicable InstaPoints coupon exceeds the value of the items ordered, the execessive discount shall be
    forfeited.
InstaShop may reward its loyal users by adding InstaPoints to their account. However, InstaShop may also
    withdraw loyalty bonuses at any point and without warning or liability.
Any attempt to manipulate the system and use of coupons or codes by participation via any party, camouflaging
    identity by manipulating IP addresses, using identities other than their own or any other automated means
    (including systems which can be programmed to do so), will render the associated orders and use of InstaPoints
    invalid and may potentially lead to that account being deactivated or the parties responsible prosecuted within
    the framework of the applicable law.
8.3. PARTNERS (SHOPS) LOYALTY
    CARD
When making your purchases from
    shops that apply a customer reward system, through the App, you have the opportunity to enter your membership
    card number in the corresponding field when completing the order so as to ensure that the points corresponding
    to the purchases you made are credited to the account you have in the respective shop.
9. CUSTOMER SERVICE & COMPLAINTS
InstaShop Customer Service
    provides information regarding any questions, issues or complaints related to the InstaShop service. Users may
    contact InstaShop via e-mail (
contact@instashop.ae)
, drop
    a message through the app or call the customer service line (+97148795000). Missing items must be reported
    immediately on reception of the Groceries, otherwise Groceries are considered to have been accepted by User as
    being in perfect condition. Latent defects must be reported to InstaShop customer Service immediately after they
    come to light, although in these cases there are limitations of error acknowledgement.
10. TIPPING
Tipping is a way InstaShop users
    can reward the drivers and pickers (staff) that are involved in executing their orders via the InstaShop mobile
    applications or websites. Users tip the staff directly via the credit/debit card they have registered. Any tip
    paid by the customer via the InstaShop mobile applications or websites will be non-refundable. All tips paid by
    the customer will be paid in the local currency of the country from where the orders are placed.
Upon rating an order with
    InstaShop, the customer will have the option to make a discretionary payment of a tip to InstaShop in addition
    to the purchase price of the items in the order. InstaShop will subtract any transactional fees related to the
    online payment gateway and bank transfer cost and shall transfer the remaining amount to staff involved in the
    execution of each specific order at a monthly or bimonthly basis. Therefore Any charges levied by the bank or
    payment gateway will be covered by the staff. Tipping is “voluntary” and at the sole discretion of
    each user.
InstaShop may at its sole
    discretion decide the exact allocation of the tip between the various staff members that contributed to the
    execution of the orders.
It is the sole responsibility of
    the picker and driver to provide accurate bank details to InstaShop via the online verification/validation form.
    InstaShop will not be liable in case of inaccurate information provided or incorrect bank transactions.

    Moreover, from 1.1.2022 according to Law 4736/2020, consumers are required to pay an environmental fee of five
    cents (0.05 €), including VAT, for each piece of disposable plastic product available as a package of ready-made
    drinks and food in mass catering and retail.

    In all cases, the responsibility for selling and charging the plastic bags as well as the plastic containers
    lies with our partners (Shops) that sell the products and not with Instashop.

    During the submission and delivery of an order, the environmental fees mentioned above are reflected in the
    order’s receipt and are returned, upon completion of the order, to our partners (Shops).
4.3. PAYMENT METHODS /
    CREDITWORTHINESS
You can choose from the following
    ways of paying on delivery, depending on the products, the means of dispatch and as per technical
    availability:
* Credit card reader on delivery
* Cash on delivery
* Online payment
* We accept payments online using Visa, MasterCard and AMEX (valid for UAE only) credit or debit card in the
    currency of the country where the User is located at the time of ordering.
* If you make a payment for our products or services on our website or application, the details you are asked to
    submit will be provided directly to our payment provider via a secured connection.
* The cardholder must retain a copy of transaction records and Merchant policies and rules.
The User can select which payment
    method is preferred. The payment methods available are displayed for selection when the order is finalized. If
    for any reason the online payment transaction is declined, InstaShop is entitled, at its soles discretion, to
    offer the User cash on delivery payment option or credit card reader on delivery where available.
In the event that you have paid
    for an order with Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or another wallet and such payment fails to process, you authorise
    InstaShop to charge the order in any authorised credit card you may have on our platform.
5. PRODUCT DECLARATION
5.1. PRODUCT INFORMATION
We take care to update the product
    information in the Service regularly. In rare cases, the information may deviate from the details printed on the
    product packaging. In such an instance, the information on the packaging takes precedence. Because recipes may
    change anytime, we recommend that you regularly consult the ingredients list and allergy-related information on
    the packaging.
6. GUARANTEE of DATA COMMUNICATION
Given the current state of the
    technology, no guarantee can be given that data communication via the internet will be error-free and/or
    available at all times. InstaShop therefore accepts no liability in respect of the constant, uninterrupted
    availability of the online shop, nor for technical and electronic faults during sales transaction, in particular
    for any delay in processing or accepting orders.
7. SPECIAL PRODUCT CONDITIONS
7.1. PREPAYED MOBILE PHONE
    CREDIT
InstaShop sells mobile phone
    credit of various providers as for example: Etisalat and DU. Mobile phone credit should be activated as soon as
    possible. The activation code is valid only once. No exchanges or refunds are permitted.
8. DISCOUNTS, PRIVILEGES & VOUCHERS
8.1. SPECIAL OFFERS
The User accepts that offers
    available from InstaShop often differ from those available from Shop sales channels.
8.2 INSTAPOINTS
InstaPoints is an innovative way
    of rewarding customers with points in the application or website that can be converted to credit in an upcoming
    grocery order.
The value of 1 InstaPoint is displayed within the application or website and may be modified without prior
    notice and may differ from region to region and from country to country.
Unless otherwise specified, all coupons or codes must be redeemed within one calendar month from the moment they
    are issued/communicated.
InstaPoints coupons cannot be exchanged for cash or any other alternatives and have no monetary value.
InstaPoints may be offered on an ad-hoc basis and will be added to the customer’s account to be used in an
    upcoming grocery order.
InstaPoints can only be redeemed through the application where they are supported and are applicable.
Each InstaPoints coupon can only be used once per user.
InstaPoints can be applied as a discount towards the purchase price of products available on our platform. However, it is important to note that InstaPoints cannot be used to cover any service fees, preparation fees, or delivery charges incurred during the transaction. These fees will remain payable by the user and are not subject to be paid through the redemption of InstaPoints.
If an order, where an InstaPoints coupon has been used, is cancelled for any reason the coupon(s) will be
    reimbursed to the user, either automatically or otherwise upon the user’s request.
If the applicable InstaPoints coupon exceeds the value of the items ordered, the execessive discount shall be
    forfeited.
InstaShop may reward its loyal users by adding InstaPoints to their account. However, InstaShop may also
    withdraw loyalty bonuses at any point and without warning or liability.
Any attempt to manipulate the system and use of coupons or codes by participation via any party, camouflaging
    identity by manipulating IP addresses, using identities other than their own or any other automated means
    (including systems which can be programmed to do so), will render the associated orders and use of InstaPoints
    invalid and may potentially lead to that account being deactivated or the parties responsible prosecuted within
    the framework of the applicable law.
8.3. PARTNERS (SHOPS) LOYALTY
    CARD
When making your purchases from
    shops that apply a customer reward system, through the App, you have the opportunity to enter your membership
    card number in the corresponding field when completing the order so as to ensure that the points corresponding
    to the purchases you made are credited to the account you have in the respective shop.
9. CUSTOMER SERVICE & COMPLAINTS
InstaShop Customer Service
    provides information regarding any questions, issues or complaints related to the InstaShop service. Users may
    contact InstaShop via e-mail (
contact@instashop.ae)
, drop
    a message through the app or call the customer service line (+97148795000). Missing items must be reported
    immediately on reception of the Groceries, otherwise Groceries are considered to have been accepted by User as
    being in perfect condition. Latent defects must be reported to InstaShop customer Service immediately after they
    come to light, although in these cases there are limitations of error acknowledgement.
10. TIPPING
Tipping is a way InstaShop users
    can reward the drivers and pickers (staff) that are involved in executing their orders via the InstaShop mobile
    applications or websites. Users tip the staff directly via the credit/debit card they have registered. Any tip
    paid by the customer via the InstaShop mobile applications or websites will be non-refundable. All tips paid by
    the customer will be paid in the local currency of the country from where the orders are placed.
Upon rating an order with
    InstaShop, the customer will have the option to make a discretionary payment of a tip to InstaShop in addition
    to the purchase price of the items in the order. InstaShop will subtract any transactional fees related to the
    online payment gateway and bank transfer cost and shall transfer the remaining amount to staff involved in the
    execution of each specific order at a monthly or bimonthly basis. Therefore Any charges levied by the bank or
    payment gateway will be covered by the staff. Tipping is “voluntary” and at the sole discretion of
    each user.
InstaShop may at its sole
    discretion decide the exact allocation of the tip between the various staff members that contributed to the
    execution of the orders.
It is the sole responsibility of
    the picker and driver to provide accurate bank details to InstaShop via the online verification/validation form.
    InstaShop will not be liable in case of inaccurate information provided or incorrect bank transactions.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information you provide to us or allow others to provide to us
At various points in the InstaShop experience, you may provide us with information about yourself. For example, when you create an account with InstaShop, you provide us with personal information like your name, email address, and zip code. And if you place an order with InstaShop, we collect information including your address, phone number, the details of your order, payment data, and customer support data.
If you log into the InstaShop service through a third-party, we may receive some information about you through them. For example, if you choose to log into InstaShop with your Facebook account, we may receive information about your contacts. We may also offer social sharing tools (such as the Facebook Like button) that let you share actions on InstaShop with other sites and vice versa. You should check the privacy policies of these services and your settings there for more information.
Technical information about usage of InstaShop
When you use the InstaShop services, either through a browser or mobile app, we automatically receive some technical information about the hardware and software that is being used.

We employ some third-party services to help us understand the usage of InstaShop, and these third-parties may also deploy cookies on our site or collect information through our mobile applications.

WHAT WE SHARE
InstaShop is a platform that connects users with Personal Shoppers who shop for and deliver the goods that you want from retailers. In order to make this work, we need to share information about you and your order with the other parties who help enable the service. This includes, for example, the Personal Shopper(s) who pick and deliver your order.
We also share information under the following principles:
With your consent or at your direction We will share your information with entities outside of InstaShop when we have your consent to do so or it is done at your direction. For example:
If you enter loyalty card information from a particular retailer, we share that information with the retailer you chose along with your order so that information can update your loyalty card account.
If you share a recipe publicly on InstaShop, it is viewable by anyone along with your first name and last initial.
If you invite friends to use InstaShop through our referral program InstaFriend, we will share some information with the friends you invite like your name and phone number.
For external processing We sometimes employ third parties outside of InstaShop to process information on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy and using other appropriate security and confidentiality measures
For legal purposes We share your information when we believe that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or requests from law enforcement or regulatory authorities, (b) prevent, detect, or otherwise handle fraud, security, or technical issues, and (c) protect the safety, rights, or property of any person, the public, or InstaShop.
On a non-personal or aggregate basis, We share information with retailers and advertisers on both a non-personally identifying basis (including order and delivery details but not including credit card information) and an aggregate basis.
For business purposes We may share your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. We may also share your information between and among InstaShop, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
We do not share location data with third parties except for the purposes explicitly outlined in this Policy, such as logistics and delivery service optimization.
APPLICABLE ONLY TO USERS IN THE MENA REGION:
You agree that we may allow carefully selected third parties, including without limitation to marketing and advertising companies, our affiliates and associates, to contact you about services that may be of interest to you. They may contact you by telephone, SMS as well as by E-mail.
If you change your mind about being contacted by these companies in the future, please let us know by using the mentioned email address set out below and/or by amending your profile accordingly.
We may use the information that you provide to us if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with (and/or where we believe we are under a duty to comply with) any legal obligation, or in order to enforce our website Terms of Service and any other agreement, or to protect the rights of InstaShop. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and prevention.
We may share or need to transfer to or store data we have received from you with affiliates and subsidiaries of InstaShop ("
Affiliates
") which are located in countries or jurisdictions other than the UAE. The laws governing data protection in these countries or jurisdictions may differ from the laws in the UAE. We will comply with the laws applicable in the UAE and take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that similar and/or comparable standards for data protection are maintained by any Affiliates which are recipients of your information.
By your voluntary submission of your personal information to us, you are consenting to the disclosure, transfer and use of your personal information outside of the UAE for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
DELIVERY HERO GROUP COMPANIES
We are part of an international group of companies with legal entities in many parts of the world, including our group's headquarters located with Delivery Hero SE in Berlin, Germany. In order to utilize our resources efficiently and ensure that our business processes function properly, we utilize our group-wide shared technological support services that sometimes necessitate sharing personal data with our parent company, Delivery Hero SE, or with the locations of our global tech hubs. In certain situations, we might also share your data with other group companies, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control or ownership of Delivery Hero SE, for example, to assist with performing data analytics to understand your behavior and preferences and improve our services in terms of user experience, product development, pricing, promotions, and customer engagement. This process may involve customer segmentation based on the data we collect from you.
We process Customer ID, order and delivery data, and device information to achieve this.
The insights are typically aggregated (meaning processed fully anonymously, so you can never be identified as a person by anybody) or pseudonymized (meaning it will be very hard to identify you as a person).
Delivery Hero group companies are bound by strict intra-group data transfer agreements that ensure compliance with data protection requirements whenever personal data is shared with group companies.
Please note that these processes will not have a legal or similar significant effect on you. The only result of this process will be that you will receive suggestions about products or vendors that match your interests and preferences.
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS, CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP
In the event of a merger with, or acquisition by, another company, or group of undertakings, or change of control, we may need to disclose limited information to that company and their advisors who are under professional obligations to maintain the confidentiality of your personal data. This may occur in circumstances such as mutual due diligence assessments, data analysis, and regulatory disclosures.
In any event, we will ensure that we disclose only the minimum amount of information necessary to conduct the transaction while also carefully considering the feasibility of removing or anonymizing any data that could identify individuals.
How do we transfer your personal data to other countries?
We and the parties we share your personal data with may transfer personal data to countries other than the country in which you use our services. Where such transfers occur, we take appropriate measures to ensure that your data is always afforded adequate protection in the countries to which it is transferred.
If there are specific further requirements of the law of the country in which you use our services, we will abide by them as well. Specifically, as far as transfers to countries other than your country, we rely on a number of appropriate safeguards:
Adequacy decisions by the Data Protection Authority;
Standard contractual clauses mutually agreed in our contract with the data recipient (including any supplementary measures, if required).
Further appropriate safeguards
WHAT ARE YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS?
Under the data protection laws, you are entitled to the following rights:
Right to access
You have the right to access your personal data and obtain additional information on how we process it. You may also request a copy of your personal data.
Right to rectification
If you notice that your personal data is incorrect, you can always request that we correct it.
Right to erasure
You have the right to ask us to delete your personal data. Please note that even if you exercise this right, we may be required to retain some of your information if we process it as part of our legal obligations, or in pursuit of our own (or a third party's legitimate interests) such as the assertion of, or defense against legal claims, concluding customer care inquiries, preventing fraud or protecting ourselves or others against abusive behavior,
Right to restriction of processing
If you have requested the deletion of your personal data, but we are legally prevented from immediately deleting it, we will store your data in our archives and retain them for the sole purpose of meeting our legal obligations. However, you will not be able to use our services during this time, as this would require us to de-archive your personal data.
Right to data portability
You can ask us to provide you or another data controller with your personal data in a machine-readable format. However, please note that this right only applies to data that we process based on your consent and/or to data that we process for the fulfillment of a contractual obligation of ours.
Right to object
You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to any processing of your personal data, which is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can prove compelling grounds for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend against legal claims.
You also have the right to object at any time, without giving any explanations, to the process of your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing (including any associated profiling).
Right of complaint
You can raise a complaint about our processing with the data protection authority in the country of your habitual residence, place of work, or the place where you think a violation of data protection laws has occurred. In the case of cross-border data processing, you can also lodge a complaint with our Data Protection Officer.
Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing
You have the right to object to a fully automated decision (i.e. without any human intervention in the decision-making process) that has legal effects or significantly affects you.
To exercise your rights, we encourage you to reach out to our customer care team to assist you at this email
contact@instashop.ae
.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?
We retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to achieve the purposes we described above. The duration for which we retain your personal data is determined by factors such as the scope, nature and purposes of the personal data processing, and whether we have legitimate interests or legal obligations that require us to retain your personal data.
HOW DO WE USE ALGORITHMIC DECISION-MAKING?
Some of our processes may include the use of algorithmic decision making and machine learning. We consistently strive to implement methods that ensure al significant level of human oversight in the decision-making process, enabling us to modify or reverse decisions as needed.
In many cases, the algorithmic decision-making processes without human oversight will not have legal or similar significant effects on you. Where they do, we will ensure that you have the right not to be subject to the algorithmic decision-making processes, unless those processes are authorized by applicable law or are necessary for the entering into or performance of a contract. In these cases, you can always oppose the decision and request for a human evaluation by contacting us.

This policy may change from time to time and any revised Policy will be posted at this page, so we encourage you to review it regularly. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as a notice on our homepage or sending you a notification).
