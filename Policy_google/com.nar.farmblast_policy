About Us
ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“ironSource Mobile”) operates 3 main services:
Ad  Network – We have a network that connects app developers with  advertisers, and helps app developers to serve ads on their apps. App  developers means the company or individual that developed and operates  the mobile app that is integrated with or otherwise sends information to  ironSource Mobile. Advertiser is a company or an individual that  advertises its products or services within the app.
Mediation  Platform – A platform that helps app developers to manage all the ad  providers with which they have a direct relationship (e.g. ironSource  Mobile ad network, third party ad networks, additional online  advertising companies, etc.) that serve ads on their apps.
Marketing Platform – We help advertisers to create and optimize advertising campaigns.
We collect information in either of 2 ways:
Directly  – from your device through our SDK integrated by app developers in  their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component  that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information  directly from the end users of such app.
Indirectly  – through other ad networks with which we engage in order to serve you  with ads, or by receiving information from our advertisers.
We  collect information as described in this privacy policy for ironSource  Mobile’s own purposes, as a data controller under data protection law  where relevant, except as otherwise indicated herein.
Scope
This  privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with  respect to information it processes through its ad network, mediation  platform, and marketing platform. This privacy policy does not govern  the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for  advertisers.
ironSource  Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly,  throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the  language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes  we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. Accordingly,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”,  it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the  transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (AKA  the GDPR), and therefore it applies only to users (devices) who we deem  to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or  Switzerland.
Information We Collect
Information  collected directly from you through our SDK, and information provided  to us by a third party ad network (“Ad Network Information”) –
Identifiers:  Your Advertising ID, an additional unique identifier of available  solely from within the app of the app developer which cannot be used to  identify you on other apps, IP address, information about your browser  settings. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on  Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”) or ID For Vendor  (“IDFV”) on iOS devices. The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent  identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising  companies to recognize your device across non-affiliated apps, for  purposes such as frequency capping, attribution, fraud detection,  personalized advertising, and whitelisting. You can find additional  information about how to limit our use of your Advertising ID under “How  to Control Your Information”.
General  technical information about your device: The ironSource Mobile SDK  version, your time zone, the amount of free memory on your device, the  name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status,  limit ad tracking status, operating system name and version, timestamp,  the name of the manufacturer of the device, the language of the  operating system, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection  type (e.g. WiFi).
Interaction with our ads: An indication if you viewed or clicked on an ad.
Information  received (through our SDK) from app developers that are integrated with  our mediation platform (“Mediation Information”) – your age, gender,  in-app purchases, advance in the game, and such other information  provided by the app developer.
Information  received from advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a  third party in behalf of such advertiser) (“Advertiser Information”) –
Identifiers:  Your advertising ID, IP address, a unique identifier of your device  available solely with respect to the advertiser, information about your  browser settings.
Campaign  information: an indication that you installed the advertiser’s app  following a click on or a view of an ad served by us or otherwise;  information about actions you performed within an advertiser’s app  following such an install, such as in-app purchases, level in the game,  and the number of times you opened the app; and other information that  the advertiser decides to share with us.
How We Use the Information We Collect:
As  stated above, we perform 3 main services. For each such service, we use  the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general  description of how we use your information across our services:
Serving  Ads on App Developers’ Apps – We use the Ad Network Information  collected from your device to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More  specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use your Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting,  billing and attribution: We use your Ad Network Information to generate  reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers,  including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will  receive payment for our service.
Internal  Operations: We use your Ad Network Information for internal operations,  such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud  detection and prevention: We use your Ad Network Information for  detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.
Optimization  and frequency capping: We use your Ad Network Information for  optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of  times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of  ads you view in a specific app.
Personalized  advertising: Our corporate affiliates and advertisers may use your Ad  Network Information for personalized advertising (i.e. ads that are  based on your interest or profile).
Operating  our Mediation Platform – We use your Advertising ID, IP address, and  Mediation Information collected from your device to operate our  mediation platform. More specifically, we use such information for the  following purposes:
Reporting:  We generate reports for the app developers using our mediation platform  in order to allow them to better understand their audience in terms of  interaction with ads.
Segmentation:  We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they  configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to  use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments  of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with  personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content  of the ads served by different networks.
Sending  ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other  information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad  Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app  developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct  contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the  best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network  Information.
Operating  our Marketing Platform – We use the Advertiser Information received  from our advertisers to operate our marketing platform. More  specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Optimizing  advertising campaigns: We optimize campaigns for our advertisers based,  for example, on events that happen in their app or indications of  installs received from other apps.
Suppression:  We use device IDs of users of an advertiser’s app in order not to serve  advertising campaigns of such advertiser to such users, as they already  have the advertiser’s app.
Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in their advertising campaigns.
Compliance  with legal obligations – We may use your Ad Network Information,  Mediation Information, and Advertiser Information to comply with  applicable legal obligations.
The GDPR Angle:
We  act as a processor – When we process Ad Network Information, Mediation  Information and Advertiser Information on behalf of app developers, we  act as their processors. For any request to exercise your individual  rights related to such processing (including the rights of access,  rectification, erasure, portability, and the right to restriction and/or  object to processing), you should contact the relevant app developer.
We  also act as controllers and process personal data on the basis of  legitimate interest – When we process Ad Network Information for the  purposes of optimization and frequency capping (to ensure you are not  seeing the same ad too many times), fraud detection and prevention (to  ensure that our ads are not viewed by bots, and/or any other fraudulent  means), and internal operations, as detailed above (to ensure you  receive smooth and secured experience), on the basis of our legitimate  interest or the legitimate interests of our app developers, in order to  ensure a specific campaign is .
Personalized  Advertising in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and  Switzerland – At the moment, we do not serve personalized ads to users  who are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and  Switzerland. However, as a result of technical considerations, on  certain occasions, we may be included in consent pop-ups operated by app  developers and ad networks that are engaged with us. If we start  serving personalized advertising to users who are located in the  European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we, will ask  you for your consent (typically through consent pop-us managed by app  developers and ad networks with which we work).
Further  processing of Advertiser Information – When we process Advertiser  Information, we may further process Advertiser Information for  optimization of our network based on our legitimate interest.
Legal  necessity – We may process your Ad Network Information, your Mediation  Information, and your Advertiser Information for compliance with  applicable legal obligations.
Maximum Information Retention Period:
We  will retain your Ad Network Information, Mediation Information, and  Advertiser Information for the longer of: (i) a period of up to 2 years  from the date such information is first stored in our systems; or (ii) a  period of 3 months from the last appearance of your Advertising ID in  our systems.
How We Share Your Information:
We share your Ad Network Information with:
Other ad networks – for the purpose of receiving advertising campaigns from such ad networks.
Our  corporate affiliates – from which we receive services, such as IT,  security, storage, delivery of advertising campaigns, personalized  advertising, and other internal operations.
Advertisers – for the purposes of attribution and whitelisting/blacklisting, as stated above.
Service  providers – We share your Ad Network Information, Mediation  Information, and Advertiser Information with our service providers for  the purpose of receiving services such as fraud detection and  prevention, viewability measurement, reporting, and storage.
Viewability  measurement – Please note that certain versions of our SDK may include  MOAT, Inc.’s SDK for the purpose of verifying if our ads were actually  viewed. Please review MOAT, Inc.’s privacy policy to learn about their  privacy practices, as available at:

How to Control Your Information:
Personalized  Ads – We collect and transfer Ad Network Information to other entities  (including our corporate affiliates and non-affiliates such as  advertisers, other ad networks, and third parties acting on behalf of  these types of entities) that use the information described in this  Privacy Policy for serving you with personalized ads (i.e. ads that are  based on your interests or profile).

III. Tapjoy General Privacy Practices
1. How We Secure Your Information
We  have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures  designed to safeguard, and to help prevent unauthorized access to, your  information and to maintain data security. These safeguards take into  account the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and  store and the current state of technology. Although we take appropriate  measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information,  the Internet and the services are not 100% secure so we cannot assure  you that information we collect or store will be protected from all  unauthorized access.
2. International Users
If  you are located outside the United States and choose to use our  services, engage with ads served by Tapjoy, and/or provide information  to us, your information is provided to Tapjoy in the United States, and  may be and processed and stored in the United States and otherwise  outside of your country of residence, by Tapjoy and by third parties  with whom we share in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using the  services, you consent to the export of your information outside of your  country of residence.
3. Children
Tapjoy  does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from  children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly allow such persons  to use our services. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to  register for MyTapjoy or any other Tapjoy service or send any  information about yourself to us. In the event that we learn that we  have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without  verified parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as  possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or  about a child under 13, please contact us at

We  reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to  reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the  features of our services, or advances in technology. Please check this  page periodically for changes. Use of information we collect is subject  to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.  Please review the changes carefully. Your continued use of our services  following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you  consent to and accept those changes.
5. Links to Third Party Sites and Services
Our  services may contain links to third-party websites, including social  media services. Your use of these features may result in the collection,  processing or sharing of information about you, depending on the  feature.

6. Do Not Track Requests
Many  browsers and devices allow the user to limit tracking by enabling a  preference called “Do Not Track.” Tapjoy recognizes such preferences,  and responds to them when they are enabled in a device or browser by  providing generic advertising offers only, rather than using collected  data to provide targeted advertising offers.

OneSignal Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 2, 2018
OneSignal.,  a U.S. company located at 2194 Esperanca Avenue, Santa Clara, CA 95054  (“OneSignal” “we,” “us,” and “our”), provides this privacy policy  because we believe that consumers should have clear and comprehensive  ways to understand how information about them is collected and used –  both to provide our services and for third party advertising purposes.  We’ve tried to write this policy in a way that is easy for consumers to  understand at a “high level,” while still providing detail to allow  sophisticated users (and privacy advocates) to understand what data  models we’re engaged in, and more generally, how interest-based  advertising works.
We’ve  also provided a section about the choices that you have with respect to  “interest based advertising,”, and we encourage you to read that  section and exercise your “opt out” rights if you’re inclined to do  that. (But because interest based advertising leads to more relevant  (and thus, less annoying) advertising, we hope you won’t do that.)
Introduction and Background
OneSignal’s  provides SDKs to mobile app developers and websites, and data and  analytics services to other data partners and advertisers. These web and  mobile SDKs permit app developers and websites to send, manage,  optimize and customize push notifications to their users. All of these  services (further described in this privacy policy) are referred to  collectively as our “Services,” and all of these developers, website  operators, partners and advertisers are referred to collectively as our  “Clients.”
This  privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we may collect, use,  store, and disclose information about the end users (“End Users”) of  third-party mobile applications and websites that use our Services. We  also collect information on our corporate website(s), including any  website on which this Privacy Policy is posted. We separately describe  how we collect, use and share that website information (“OneSignal  Website Information”) in Section 4, below.
We  encourage consumers to learn about how information (including  information we collect) can be used to market to them, and how to  exercise their choices to permit or, if they prefer, to limit such  marketing. We describe some ways consumers can exercise that choice or  opt out of marketing in Section 6, below, titled Consumer Control &  Opt Out Options.
Our SDKs: Information We Collect and Services We Provide
We  refer to the information we collect from our SDKs as the ‘SDK  Information.” The SDK Information includes (or may include) the  following:
Information Collected About End Users by Our Web SDKs
Web  pages visited that have implemented the SDK , and information about  those visits (e.g., session duration, time-stamp, referring URLs)
What push notifications an End User has been sent
Information about End User’s transactions and interactions with apps and websites
IP address, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information
Email address which we may (in our discretion) hash or otherwise deidentify
Information  about an End User’s browser, such as, browser language type and version  of operating system (e.g., Android, iOS); network provider; language  setting; time zone
A  unique cookie identifier, which may uniquely identify an End User (such  as in de-identified or anonymous form). These cookies may be associated  with other Information, including with Data Segments, which we describe  in Section 3.
Information Collected About End Users by Our Mobile SDKs
When  permitted by the operating system, OneSignal may check to see if the  device has specific applications installed, based on a limited list, for  purposes that include attribution, relevancy of ads, and relevancy of  notifications related to those applications.
Purchases made within an app.
Information about End User’s transactions and interactions with apps and websites
Mobile  advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs  (“Mobile IDs”). These Mobile IDs may be associated with other  Information, including with Data Segments.
Precise  Location information, generally an End User’s lat/long data (i.e.,  GPS-level data) or WiFi information, which we may associate with Mobile  IDs, and which may be collected whether or not an app is in use.
Email address, which we may (in our discretion) hash or otherwise deidentify.
IP address as well as system configuration information
Information  associated with or related to devices, such as device type (e.g.,  mobile, tablet); type and version of operating system (e.g., Android,  iOS); network provider; mobile browser (e.g. Safari, Chrome, etc.);  language setting; time zone; and network status type (such as WiFi).
As noted above, we refer to all of the above collectively as the “SDK Information.”
How We Use the SDK Information
We use the SDK Information to provide a variety of Services to our Clients. This includes:
To  Provide Our App and Website Services. We use the SDK Information to  offer and support app and website features provided through the SDKs,  including those related to push notifications. This includes, for  instance, providing customer, technical and operational support for  these features, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other  criminal activity; resolving disputes and enforcing our EULA and other  rights we may have. It also includes analyzing, customizing, and  improving the features we offer Clients.
To  provide information and analytics to our Clients about the use of these  app and website features provided through the SDKs, or to help app  developers and website operators create or enhance user profiles.
To  create inferences about End Users categorized into “Data Segments” or  to help Clients do so. For instance, if SDK Information indicates that a  particular device is frequently seen at restaurants, we might  categorize a user for targeting of local restaurant offers. Or, if a  user is frequently seen at sports stadiums, we might categorize the user  as a “Sports Fan.”
To  develop and use “predictive models” – data models that try to predict  End Users’ potential future behavior and interests on a per-device basis  or across devices
To  analyze ad performance, for instance, by attributing End Users’ app  installations, web visits, or store visits to ad campaigns.
Sometimes,  the SDK Information may be used (by us or ad and data platforms we work  with) to resolve identities across multiple devices, such as to match  IP addresses or hashed emails to link an End User across (for instance)  browsers, mobile devices, tablets, set top boxes, or other devices.
Sometimes  the SDK Information may be combined (by us or ad and data platforms we  work with), to perform any of the above functions, or other advertising,  marketing or analytics services. Or, we may aggregate and create data  “models” to do this – creating algorithms in order to predict certain  trends and things that different End Users might have in common, for  instance.
We  may provide End Users’ email addresses (which we generally “hash” or  render non-human readable) to online data platforms that “match” this  information to online cookies or Mobile IDs in their system, and tie the  information (or associated IDs) to further interest-based or  demographic data about End Users. This may be done, for instance, to  target advertising or provide analytics to brands and other companies.
We,  or ad and data platforms we work with, may deploy online cookies to  track users across websites, or to associate users (and these cookies)  with Mobile IDs. We or they may do this to resolve user identifies  across platforms, and to better or more accurately target relevant ads  to users (such as to a brand’s customers). You can learn more about  cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in the  Section titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs.” We may also “append” or  combine certain SDK Information (such as hashed email addresses) to  other information provided by third party data providers, to learn more  about End Users or to provide advertising and analytics services.
How and Why We Share the SDK Information. To Provide Services to Websites and Apps Using the SDKs
We  share the SDK Information with service providers, contractors and other  companies to fulfill your orders, operate our business, communicate  with you and make available our Services and this Website. These service  providers may help us perform any of the activities set forth in  Section 2. For instance, we may share certain of the information we  collect or receive with companies that help us with billing and payment,  marketing, advertising and email marketing,
data  enhancement (e.g., to provide more relevant offers), website hosting,  technology and customer support, web and marketing analytics, anti-fraud  or security operations, and other operational, marketing or business  support.
We  likewise may share the SDK Information or Data Segments we create with  website operators and app developers (for instance, related to push  notifications they send) for their advertising, analytics, or other  purposes.
To Provide Services to Marketers, Advertisers and Platforms They Work With
We  also share SDK Information to provide or help us to provide advertising  and marketing services as we have described in Section 3, including as  follows:
With  advertisers and their marketing providers, so they may provide targeted  content and advertising to you on websites and mobile applications With  other third parties that target advertising. For those familiar with  the online ad ecosystem, these may include demand-side and supply-side  advertising platforms, data management platforms, advertising agency  trading desks, proximity solution providers, and other advertising  technology providers, so they may provide targeted content and  advertising to End Users and others on third-party websites, mobile  applications, and other advertising mediums (email, direct mail, display  media), and so that they may measure the effectiveness of this  marketing.
Similarly,  we may work with service providers who, to enhance consumer privacy,  use a non-human readable “hashed” version of Information such as an  email address when sending advertising offers by email or display  advertising (which may be linked to a cookie as described above).
Sometimes  we provide information (such as IP address, but excluding precise  lat/long coordinates) to third party platforms to help advertisers  identify common users across different devices or browsers – for  instance, to identify a
The  processes we’ve described above often involves cookies or similar  technologies, which may be associated with other information about you,  e.g., your interests, demographics or transactions. This is known  generally as “Interest-Based Advertising.” We encourage users who are  interested in controlling or learning about this type of “interest-based  advertising” to go to Section 6, titled “Consumer Control & Opt-Out  Options, or go to this this page operated by the online ad industry  trade association.
We may also share the SDK Information with third parties:
If an End User or Client requests or authorizes
If  the information is provided to: (1) comply in good faith with  applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental  requests, court orders, or subpoenas; (2) enforce our Terms of Use or  other agreements; or (3) protect our rights, property, or safety or the  rights, property, or safety of our users or any other person or entity
If  the disclosure is done as part of, including as part of due diligence  for, a purchase, transfer, or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the  event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another  party, any information we have may be one of the transferred assets) or  in the event of bankruptcy
Even when you no longer access the SDKs, we may continue to use and share your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
How we Use and Share Information Collected on the OneSignal Website(s)
Website Information We Collect
We  collect the following information from visitors to our websites (the  “OneSignal Website Information”, including the website on which this  Privacy Policy appears (“OneSignal Website(s)”):
Volunteered:  You may share information with us on the OneSignal Websites when you  request information from us, fill out a form on our website, or interact  with us in other ways. This information may include personal  information, such as your name, email address, and other contact  information.
Passively  Collected (e.g., Cookies and Unique IDs): We use automated mechanisms,  such as cookies, pixels, and other locally stored objects (such as  “IndexedDB)”) that we associate with unique identifiers in order to keep  track of visitor interactions with the OneSignal Websites. (You can  learn more about these technologies below in the Section titled  “Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs”)). We may use third party-services such  as Google Analytics, in which case those third parties gather  information such as your IP address, browser type, the webpage from  which you came to our website, and the times of your access to the  OneSignal Website. In addition, as you browse our website, advertising  cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what  you are interested in. Our display advertising partners may then help us  retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the  OneSignal Website. To “opt out” of having your information used to  tailor ads to you in this way by third party ad platforms that we may  work with or provide data to, please review the Section below titled  “Consumer Control and Opt Out Options” to learn how to opt-out of these  services and instead receive generic, non-tailored ads.
How We Use the OneSignal Website Information
In  addition to the uses described above, we use the OneSignal Website  Information (alone or in combination) to provide, market, and operate  the OneSignal Websites and Services. Among other things, by collecting  the OneSignal Website Information, we are able to
Maintain and offer access to the OneSignal Websites and Services and optimize how they’re offered to our Clients.
Send information about our products and services, including marketing communications.
Respond to your questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries.
Customize the content and advertising you see on the OneSignal Websites, across the Internet, and elsewhere.
How We Share the OneSignal Website Information
We may share the OneSignal Website Information as follows:
As  part of a business sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in  control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation,  or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event  (e.g., due diligence).
With our corporate affiliates.
With  third parties that help us to provide the OneSignal Websites or  Services, such as entities that help us make the OneSignal Websites or  Services available and functional (such as hosting services); entities  that help us make available or transmit any information we hold (such as  helping us send emails, process payments, and manage customer  information); and entities that help us (including our contractors,  agents, and affiliates) provide technical, customer, billing,  administrative, event planning, marketing or operational services to us  or our Clients.
When  required by law or in response to lawful process, such as a subpoena,  or to cooperate in good faith with a request from a government or law  enforcement agency or official.
If  we believe sharing the information may prevent physical, financial or  other harm, injury or loss; or we believe is necessary to protect our,  or any other person’s or entity’s, interests; or in connection with an  investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
We also may disclose your information under circumstances not mentioned here with your prior consent.
Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs
Cookies  and Pixel Tags. Cookies are small data files containing a string of  characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier. Cookies are  stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that  identify your device or browser. Our servers may send your device a  cookie when you visit the OneSignal Websites, and our Clients and  Partners may do likewise on our Websites, our Clients’ websites, and  elsewhere. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear  GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.  When you access web pages on which a pixel tag is deployed, the pixel  tag may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit OneSignal, our  Clients or Partners to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in  combination with cookies to anonymously track the activity on a website  by a particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies,  pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit. OneSignal, alone or  with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, among other things,  “remember” you (e.g., when you visit the OneSignal Websites or the  websites of our Clients or Partners), track trends, and collect  information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or  interact with advertising. We and partners we work with use cookies to  provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads  that better match your interests. We may sometimes use other locally  stored objects in ways similar to how we use cookies. Often, these  objects are deleted when you clear your browser cookie cache, but  because this may not always occur (depending on the browser you use), we  recommend that if you wish to opt out of notification features or third  party interestbased advertising you instead follow the steps we have  set forth in Section 6 titled “Consumer Control & Opt-Out Options.”
Mobile  Device Identifiers and SDKs. We may use or work with partners who use  mobile SDKs (including our own SDKs, which are described in more detail  in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers  (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to  how mobile devices and their users interact with our Services and those  using our Services. The SDK is computer code that app developers can  include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected,  and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology, for  instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through mobile  applications and browsers based on information associated with your  mobile device. If you would like to opt-out from having ads tailored to  you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in  the below Section titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
As  described in Section 4 our Clients or Partners may use the above  technologies (sometimes, in combination with each other or other data  such as IP addresses or hashed or de-identified data files) to  coordinate identifiers across platforms, browsers or devices, to more  efficiently analyze or target advertising.
Consumer Control & Opt-Out Options.
In  most cases, consumers have control over whether or not they would like  to receive relevant advertisements and marketing email from our Clients.
Opting Out of OneSignal Push Notifications
You  may in most cases opt out of receiving push notifications by going to  your device “Settings” and clicking on “Notifications,” and then  changing those settings for some or all of the apps on your device.  (Different device configurations, or updates to devices, may affect or  change how these settings work.)
Your choice to opt out of “Notifications” from the OneSignal platform will not affect ads placed by any other organization.
Opting  Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising You can opt out of many of the  platforms and service providers that facilitate online interest-based  advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer  education and opt-out page, at
http://www.aboutads.info/
.  This type of opt out is cookie based, which means that if you replace  or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to opt  out again. Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving  ads – it will just make the ads you see less customized to you.
Opting Out of “Cross-App” Advertising on Mobile Devices
You  can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for  certain types of interest-based (also called “cross-app”) mobile  behavioral advertising, by accessing the “settings” on your Apple or  Android mobile device, as follows:
Apple  Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of most app-based  tracking for interest-based advertising by setting Limit Ad Tracking to  ‘ON.’ You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy ->  Advertising and toggling Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON.’
Android  Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt out of most  app-based tracking for interest-based advertising by opening the Google  Settings app on your device, selecting Ads, and then selecting the  option to opt-out of interest-based ads.
Please  note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above  may change. Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described  above, you should check the settings for those devices.
Additional Choices
Advertisers  may also provide ways for you to opt out from or limit their collection  of information from and about you. Please refer to the privacy policies  for retailers, applications and websites to learn more about their  privacy practices.
You  may opt not to receive promotional emails from us by contacting us as  indicated below or by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any  promotional email you receive from us. Please note, however, that we may  still send you non-promotional emails about your relationship with us.
Data Access and Retention
Generally  speaking, we retain the SDK Information and Website Information for as  long as necessary to achieve our objectives as detailed in this Privacy  Policy, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and  enforce our agreements.
Data Security
We  have administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in place in our  physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and  communications networks that are designed to protect information  contained within our systems from loss, misuse, or alteration. No method  of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we  cannot guarantee absolute security of your Personal Information and  Non-Personal Information.
Third Party Websites and Apps
We  are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of  websites and applications that use our Services. Likewise, when you  access the OneSignal Website, you may be directed to other websites that  are also beyond our control. We encourage you to read the applicable  privacy policies and terms and conditions of such third parties and  websites, and the industry tools that we have referenced in this Privacy  Policy. This Privacy Policy, however, only applies to the OneSignal  Site and the Services.
Users From Outside the United States
The  Website and our Services are provided, supported and hosted in the  United States, and our operation of them is governed by United States  law. If you are using the Site from outside the United States, be aware  that your Information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the  United States and other countries where our facilities are located. The  data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as  comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Site you consent to  your information being transferred to our facilities and to the  facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in  this Policy.
Contacting Us
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@OneSignal.com.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
If  we make material changes to our privacy policy that may impact you, we  will prominently post notice of the change on our website for a period  of at least 30 days prior to the change becoming effective. We recommend  that you check the Privacy Policy frequently so that you are informed  of any changes.

About Us
ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“ironSource Mobile”) operates 3 main services:
Ad  Network – We have a network that connects app developers with  advertisers, and helps app developers to serve ads on their apps. App  developers means the company or individual that developed and operates  the mobile app that is integrated with or otherwise sends information to  ironSource Mobile. Advertiser is a company or an individual that  advertises its products or services within the app.
Mediation  Platform – A platform that helps app developers to manage all the ad  providers with which they have a direct relationship (e.g. ironSource  Mobile ad network, third party ad networks, additional online  advertising companies, etc.) that serve ads on their apps.
Marketing Platform – We help advertisers to create and optimize advertising campaigns.
We collect information in either of 2 ways:
Directly  – from your device through our SDK integrated by app developers in  their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component  that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information  directly from the end users of such app.
Indirectly  – through other ad networks with which we engage in order to serve you  with ads, or by receiving information from our advertisers.
We  collect information as described in this privacy policy for ironSource  Mobile’s own purposes, as a data controller under data protection law  where relevant, except as otherwise indicated herein.
Scope
This  privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with  respect to information it processes through its ad network, mediation  platform, and marketing platform. This privacy policy does not govern  the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for  advertisers.
ironSource  Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly,  throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the  language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes  we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. Accordingly,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”,  it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the  transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (AKA  the GDPR), and therefore it applies only to users (devices) who we deem  to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or  Switzerland.
Information We Collect
Information  collected directly from you through our SDK, and information provided  to us by a third party ad network (“Ad Network Information”) –
Identifiers:  Your Advertising ID, an additional unique identifier of available  solely from within the app of the app developer which cannot be used to  identify you on other apps, IP address, information about your browser  settings. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on  Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”) or ID For Vendor  (“IDFV”) on iOS devices. The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent  identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising  companies to recognize your device across non-affiliated apps, for  purposes such as frequency capping, attribution, fraud detection,  personalized advertising, and whitelisting. You can find additional  information about how to limit our use of your Advertising ID under “How  to Control Your Information”.
General  technical information about your device: The ironSource Mobile SDK  version, your time zone, the amount of free memory on your device, the  name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status,  limit ad tracking status, operating system name and version, timestamp,  the name of the manufacturer of the device, the language of the  operating system, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection  type (e.g. WiFi).
Interaction with our ads: An indication if you viewed or clicked on an ad.
Information  received (through our SDK) from app developers that are integrated with  our mediation platform (“Mediation Information”) – your age, gender,  in-app purchases, advance in the game, and such other information  provided by the app developer.
Information  received from advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a  third party in behalf of such advertiser) (“Advertiser Information”) –
Identifiers:  Your advertising ID, IP address, a unique identifier of your device  available solely with respect to the advertiser, information about your  browser settings.
Campaign  information: an indication that you installed the advertiser’s app  following a click on or a view of an ad served by us or otherwise;  information about actions you performed within an advertiser’s app  following such an install, such as in-app purchases, level in the game,  and the number of times you opened the app; and other information that  the advertiser decides to share with us.
How We Use the Information We Collect:
As  stated above, we perform 3 main services. For each such service, we use  the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general  description of how we use your information across our services:
Serving  Ads on App Developers’ Apps – We use the Ad Network Information  collected from your device to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More  specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use your Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting,  billing and attribution: We use your Ad Network Information to generate  reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers,  including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will  receive payment for our service.
Internal  Operations: We use your Ad Network Information for internal operations,  such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud  detection and prevention: We use your Ad Network Information for  detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.
Optimization  and frequency capping: We use your Ad Network Information for  optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of  times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of  ads you view in a specific app.
Personalized  advertising: Our corporate affiliates and advertisers may use your Ad  Network Information for personalized advertising (i.e. ads that are  based on your interest or profile).
Operating  our Mediation Platform – We use your Advertising ID, IP address, and  Mediation Information collected from your device to operate our  mediation platform. More specifically, we use such information for the  following purposes:
Reporting:  We generate reports for the app developers using our mediation platform  in order to allow them to better understand their audience in terms of  interaction with ads.
Segmentation:  We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they  configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to  use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments  of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with  personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content  of the ads served by different networks.
Sending  ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other  information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad  Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app  developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct  contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the  best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network  Information.
Operating  our Marketing Platform – We use the Advertiser Information received  from our advertisers to operate our marketing platform. More  specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Optimizing  advertising campaigns: We optimize campaigns for our advertisers based,  for example, on events that happen in their app or indications of  installs received from other apps.
Suppression:  We use device IDs of users of an advertiser’s app in order not to serve  advertising campaigns of such advertiser to such users, as they already  have the advertiser’s app.
Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in their advertising campaigns.
Compliance  with legal obligations – We may use your Ad Network Information,  Mediation Information, and Advertiser Information to comply with  applicable legal obligations.
The GDPR Angle:
We  act as a processor – When we process Ad Network Information, Mediation  Information and Advertiser Information on behalf of app developers, we  act as their processors. For any request to exercise your individual  rights related to such processing (including the rights of access,  rectification, erasure, portability, and the right to restriction and/or  object to processing), you should contact the relevant app developer.
We  also act as controllers and process personal data on the basis of  legitimate interest – When we process Ad Network Information for the  purposes of optimization and frequency capping (to ensure you are not  seeing the same ad too many times), fraud detection and prevention (to  ensure that our ads are not viewed by bots, and/or any other fraudulent  means), and internal operations, as detailed above (to ensure you  receive smooth and secured experience), on the basis of our legitimate  interest or the legitimate interests of our app developers, in order to  ensure a specific campaign is .
Personalized  Advertising in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and  Switzerland – At the moment, we do not serve personalized ads to users  who are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and  Switzerland. However, as a result of technical considerations, on  certain occasions, we may be included in consent pop-ups operated by app  developers and ad networks that are engaged with us. If we start  serving personalized advertising to users who are located in the  European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we, will ask  you for your consent (typically through consent pop-us managed by app  developers and ad networks with which we work).
Further  processing of Advertiser Information – When we process Advertiser  Information, we may further process Advertiser Information for  optimization of our network based on our legitimate interest.
Legal  necessity – We may process your Ad Network Information, your Mediation  Information, and your Advertiser Information for compliance with  applicable legal obligations.
Maximum Information Retention Period:
We  will retain your Ad Network Information, Mediation Information, and  Advertiser Information for the longer of: (i) a period of up to 2 years  from the date such information is first stored in our systems; or (ii) a  period of 3 months from the last appearance of your Advertising ID in  our systems.

Advertisers – for the purposes of attribution and whitelisting/blacklisting, as stated above.
Service  providers – We share your Ad Network Information, Mediation  Information, and Advertiser Information with our service providers for  the purpose of receiving services such as fraud detection and  prevention, viewability measurement, reporting, and storage.

How to Control Your Information:

III. Tapjoy General Privacy Practices
1. How We Secure Your Information
We  have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures  designed to safeguard, and to help prevent unauthorized access to, your  information and to maintain data security. These safeguards take into  account the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and  store and the current state of technology. Although we take appropriate  measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information,  the Internet and the services are not 100% secure so we cannot assure  you that information we collect or store will be protected from all  unauthorized access.
2. International Users
If  you are located outside the United States and choose to use our  services, engage with ads served by Tapjoy, and/or provide information  to us, your information is provided to Tapjoy in the United States, and  may be and processed and stored in the United States and otherwise  outside of your country of residence, by Tapjoy and by third parties  with whom we share in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using the  services, you consent to the export of your information outside of your  country of residence.
3. Children
Tapjoy  does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from  children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly allow such persons  to use our services. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to  register for MyTapjoy or any other Tapjoy service or send any  information about yourself to us. In the event that we learn that we  have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without  verified parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as  possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or  about a child under 13, please contact us at
privacy@tapjoy.com

4. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We  reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to  reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the  features of our services, or advances in technology. Please check this  page periodically for changes. Use of information we collect is subject  to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.  Please review the changes carefully. Your continued use of our services  following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you  consent to and accept those changes.
5. Links to Third Party Sites and Services
Our  services may contain links to third-party websites, including social  media services. Your use of these features may result in the collection,  processing or sharing of information about you, depending on the  feature.

6. Do Not Track Requests
Many  browsers and devices allow the user to limit tracking by enabling a  preference called “Do Not Track.” Tapjoy recognizes such preferences,  and responds to them when they are enabled in a device or browser by  providing generic advertising offers only, rather than using collected  data to provide targeted advertising offers.

Tapjoy Privacy Policy updated June 30, 2015.
One Signal
OneSignal Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 2, 2018
OneSignal.,  a U.S. company located at 2194 Esperanca Avenue, Santa Clara, CA 95054  (“OneSignal” “we,” “us,” and “our”), provides this privacy policy  because we believe that consumers should have clear and comprehensive  ways to understand how information about them is collected and used –  both to provide our services and for third party advertising purposes.  We’ve tried to write this policy in a way that is easy for consumers to  understand at a “high level,” while still providing detail to allow  sophisticated users (and privacy advocates) to understand what data  models we’re engaged in, and more generally, how interest-based  advertising works.
We’ve  also provided a section about the choices that you have with respect to  “interest based advertising,”, and we encourage you to read that  section and exercise your “opt out” rights if you’re inclined to do  that. (But because interest based advertising leads to more relevant  (and thus, less annoying) advertising, we hope you won’t do that.)
Introduction and Background
OneSignal’s  provides SDKs to mobile app developers and websites, and data and  analytics services to other data partners and advertisers. These web and  mobile SDKs permit app developers and websites to send, manage,  optimize and customize push notifications to their users. All of these  services (further described in this privacy policy) are referred to  collectively as our “Services,” and all of these developers, website  operators, partners and advertisers are referred to collectively as our  “Clients.”
This  privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we may collect, use,  store, and disclose information about the end users (“End Users”) of  third-party mobile applications and websites that use our Services. We  also collect information on our corporate website(s), including any  website on which this Privacy Policy is posted. We separately describe  how we collect, use and share that website information (“OneSignal  Website Information”) in Section 4, below.
We  encourage consumers to learn about how information (including  information we collect) can be used to market to them, and how to  exercise their choices to permit or, if they prefer, to limit such  marketing. We describe some ways consumers can exercise that choice or  opt out of marketing in Section 6, below, titled Consumer Control &  Opt Out Options.
Our SDKs: Information We Collect and Services We Provide
We  refer to the information we collect from our SDKs as the ‘SDK  Information.” The SDK Information includes (or may include) the  following:
Information Collected About End Users by Our Web SDKs
Web  pages visited that have implemented the SDK , and information about  those visits (e.g., session duration, time-stamp, referring URLs)
What push notifications an End User has been sent
Information about End User’s transactions and interactions with apps and websites
IP address, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information
Email address which we may (in our discretion) hash or otherwise deidentify
Information  about an End User’s browser, such as, browser language type and version  of operating system (e.g., Android, iOS); network provider; language  setting; time zone
A  unique cookie identifier, which may uniquely identify an End User (such  as in de-identified or anonymous form). These cookies may be associated  with other Information, including with Data Segments, which we describe  in Section 3.
Information Collected About End Users by Our Mobile SDKs
When  permitted by the operating system, OneSignal may check to see if the  device has specific applications installed, based on a limited list, for  purposes that include attribution, relevancy of ads, and relevancy of  notifications related to those applications.
Purchases made within an app.
Information about End User’s transactions and interactions with apps and websites
Mobile  advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs  (“Mobile IDs”). These Mobile IDs may be associated with other  Information, including with Data Segments.
Precise  Location information, generally an End User’s lat/long data (i.e.,  GPS-level data) or WiFi information, which we may associate with Mobile  IDs, and which may be collected whether or not an app is in use.
Email address, which we may (in our discretion) hash or otherwise deidentify.
IP address as well as system configuration information
Information  associated with or related to devices, such as device type (e.g.,  mobile, tablet); type and version of operating system (e.g., Android,  iOS); network provider; mobile browser (e.g. Safari, Chrome, etc.);  language setting; time zone; and network status type (such as WiFi).
As noted above, we refer to all of the above collectively as the “SDK Information.”
How We Use the SDK Information
We use the SDK Information to provide a variety of Services to our Clients. This includes:
To  Provide Our App and Website Services. We use the SDK Information to  offer and support app and website features provided through the SDKs,  including those related to push notifications. This includes, for  instance, providing customer, technical and operational support for  these features, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other  criminal activity; resolving disputes and enforcing our EULA and other  rights we may have. It also includes analyzing, customizing, and  improving the features we offer Clients.
To  provide information and analytics to our Clients about the use of these  app and website features provided through the SDKs, or to help app  developers and website operators create or enhance user profiles.
To  create inferences about End Users categorized into “Data Segments” or  to help Clients do so. For instance, if SDK Information indicates that a  particular device is frequently seen at restaurants, we might  categorize a user for targeting of local restaurant offers. Or, if a  user is frequently seen at sports stadiums, we might categorize the user  as a “Sports Fan.”
To  develop and use “predictive models” – data models that try to predict  End Users’ potential future behavior and interests on a per-device basis  or across devices
To  analyze ad performance, for instance, by attributing End Users’ app  installations, web visits, or store visits to ad campaigns.
Sometimes,  the SDK Information may be used (by us or ad and data platforms we work  with) to resolve identities across multiple devices, such as to match  IP addresses or hashed emails to link an End User across (for instance)  browsers, mobile devices, tablets, set top boxes, or other devices.
Sometimes  the SDK Information may be combined (by us or ad and data platforms we  work with), to perform any of the above functions, or other advertising,  marketing or analytics services. Or, we may aggregate and create data  “models” to do this – creating algorithms in order to predict certain  trends and things that different End Users might have in common, for  instance.
We  may provide End Users’ email addresses (which we generally “hash” or  render non-human readable) to online data platforms that “match” this  information to online cookies or Mobile IDs in their system, and tie the  information (or associated IDs) to further interest-based or  demographic data about End Users. This may be done, for instance, to  target advertising or provide analytics to brands and other companies.
We,  or ad and data platforms we work with, may deploy online cookies to  track users across websites, or to associate users (and these cookies)  with Mobile IDs. We or they may do this to resolve user identifies  across platforms, and to better or more accurately target relevant ads  to users (such as to a brand’s customers). You can learn more about  cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in the  Section titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs.” We may also “append” or  combine certain SDK Information (such as hashed email addresses) to  other information provided by third party data providers, to learn more  about End Users or to provide advertising and analytics services.
How and Why We Share the SDK Information. To Provide Services to Websites and Apps Using the SDKs
We  share the SDK Information with service providers, contractors and other  companies to fulfill your orders, operate our business, communicate  with you and make available our Services and this Website. These service  providers may help us perform any of the activities set forth in  Section 2. For instance, we may share certain of the information we  collect or receive with companies that help us with billing and payment,  marketing, advertising and email marketing,
data  enhancement (e.g., to provide more relevant offers), website hosting,  technology and customer support, web and marketing analytics, anti-fraud  or security operations, and other operational, marketing or business  support.
We  likewise may share the SDK Information or Data Segments we create with  website operators and app developers (for instance, related to push  notifications they send) for their advertising, analytics, or other  purposes.
To Provide Services to Marketers, Advertisers and Platforms They Work With
We  also share SDK Information to provide or help us to provide advertising  and marketing services as we have described in Section 3, including as  follows:
With  advertisers and their marketing providers, so they may provide targeted  content and advertising to you on websites and mobile applications With  other third parties that target advertising. For those familiar with  the online ad ecosystem, these may include demand-side and supply-side  advertising platforms, data management platforms, advertising agency  trading desks, proximity solution providers, and other advertising  technology providers, so they may provide targeted content and  advertising to End Users and others on third-party websites, mobile  applications, and other advertising mediums (email, direct mail, display  media), and so that they may measure the effectiveness of this  marketing.
Similarly,  we may work with service providers who, to enhance consumer privacy,  use a non-human readable “hashed” version of Information such as an  email address when sending advertising offers by email or display  advertising (which may be linked to a cookie as described above).
Sometimes  we provide information (such as IP address, but excluding precise  lat/long coordinates) to third party platforms to help advertisers  identify common users across different devices or browsers – for  instance, to identify a
The  processes we’ve described above often involves cookies or similar  technologies, which may be associated with other information about you,  e.g., your interests, demographics or transactions. This is known  generally as “Interest-Based Advertising.” We encourage users who are  interested in controlling or learning about this type of “interest-based  advertising” to go to Section 6, titled “Consumer Control & Opt-Out  Options, or go to this this page operated by the online ad industry  trade association.
We may also share the SDK Information with third parties:
If an End User or Client requests or authorizes
If  the information is provided to: (1) comply in good faith with  applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental  requests, court orders, or subpoenas; (2) enforce our Terms of Use or  other agreements; or (3) protect our rights, property, or safety or the  rights, property, or safety of our users or any other person or entity
If  the disclosure is done as part of, including as part of due diligence  for, a purchase, transfer, or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the  event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another  party, any information we have may be one of the transferred assets) or  in the event of bankruptcy
Even when you no longer access the SDKs, we may continue to use and share your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
How we Use and Share Information Collected on the OneSignal Website(s)
Website Information We Collect
We  collect the following information from visitors to our websites (the  “OneSignal Website Information”, including the website on which this  Privacy Policy appears (“OneSignal Website(s)”):
Volunteered:  You may share information with us on the OneSignal Websites when you  request information from us, fill out a form on our website, or interact  with us in other ways. This information may include personal  information, such as your name, email address, and other contact  information.
Passively  Collected (e.g., Cookies and Unique IDs): We use automated mechanisms,  such as cookies, pixels, and other locally stored objects (such as  “IndexedDB)”) that we associate with unique identifiers in order to keep  track of visitor interactions with the OneSignal Websites. (You can  learn more about these technologies below in the Section titled  “Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs”)). We may use third party-services such  as Google Analytics, in which case those third parties gather  information such as your IP address, browser type, the webpage from  which you came to our website, and the times of your access to the  OneSignal Website. In addition, as you browse our website, advertising  cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what  you are interested in. Our display advertising partners may then help us  retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the  OneSignal Website. To “opt out” of having your information used to  tailor ads to you in this way by third party ad platforms that we may  work with or provide data to, please review the Section below titled  “Consumer Control and Opt Out Options” to learn how to opt-out of these  services and instead receive generic, non-tailored ads.
How We Use the OneSignal Website Information
In  addition to the uses described above, we use the OneSignal Website  Information (alone or in combination) to provide, market, and operate  the OneSignal Websites and Services. Among other things, by collecting  the OneSignal Website Information, we are able to
Maintain and offer access to the OneSignal Websites and Services and optimize how they’re offered to our Clients.
Send information about our products and services, including marketing communications.
Respond to your questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries.
Customize the content and advertising you see on the OneSignal Websites, across the Internet, and elsewhere.
How We Share the OneSignal Website Information
We may share the OneSignal Website Information as follows:
As  part of a business sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in  control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation,  or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event  (e.g., due diligence).
With our corporate affiliates.
With  third parties that help us to provide the OneSignal Websites or  Services, such as entities that help us make the OneSignal Websites or  Services available and functional (such as hosting services); entities  that help us make available or transmit any information we hold (such as  helping us send emails, process payments, and manage customer  information); and entities that help us (including our contractors,  agents, and affiliates) provide technical, customer, billing,  administrative, event planning, marketing or operational services to us  or our Clients.
When  required by law or in response to lawful process, such as a subpoena,  or to cooperate in good faith with a request from a government or law  enforcement agency or official.
If  we believe sharing the information may prevent physical, financial or  other harm, injury or loss; or we believe is necessary to protect our,  or any other person’s or entity’s, interests; or in connection with an  investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
We also may disclose your information under circumstances not mentioned here with your prior consent.
Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs
Cookies  and Pixel Tags. Cookies are small data files containing a string of  characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier. Cookies are  stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that  identify your device or browser. Our servers may send your device a  cookie when you visit the OneSignal Websites, and our Clients and  Partners may do likewise on our Websites, our Clients’ websites, and  elsewhere. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear  GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.  When you access web pages on which a pixel tag is deployed, the pixel  tag may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit OneSignal, our  Clients or Partners to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in  combination with cookies to anonymously track the activity on a website  by a particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies,  pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit. OneSignal, alone or  with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, among other things,  “remember” you (e.g., when you visit the OneSignal Websites or the  websites of our Clients or Partners), track trends, and collect  information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or  interact with advertising. We and partners we work with use cookies to  provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads  that better match your interests. We may sometimes use other locally  stored objects in ways similar to how we use cookies. Often, these  objects are deleted when you clear your browser cookie cache, but  because this may not always occur (depending on the browser you use), we  recommend that if you wish to opt out of notification features or third  party interestbased advertising you instead follow the steps we have  set forth in Section 6 titled “Consumer Control & Opt-Out Options.”
Mobile  Device Identifiers and SDKs. We may use or work with partners who use  mobile SDKs (including our own SDKs, which are described in more detail  in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers  (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to  how mobile devices and their users interact with our Services and those  using our Services. The SDK is computer code that app developers can  include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected,  and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology, for  instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through mobile  applications and browsers based on information associated with your  mobile device. If you would like to opt-out from having ads tailored to  you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in  the below Section titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
As  described in Section 4 our Clients or Partners may use the above  technologies (sometimes, in combination with each other or other data  such as IP addresses or hashed or de-identified data files) to  coordinate identifiers across platforms, browsers or devices, to more  efficiently analyze or target advertising.
Consumer Control & Opt-Out Options.
In  most cases, consumers have control over whether or not they would like  to receive relevant advertisements and marketing email from our Clients.
Opting Out of OneSignal Push Notifications
You  may in most cases opt out of receiving push notifications by going to  your device “Settings” and clicking on “Notifications,” and then  changing those settings for some or all of the apps on your device.  (Different device configurations, or updates to devices, may affect or  change how these settings work.)
Your choice to opt out of “Notifications” from the OneSignal platform will not affect ads placed by any other organization.
Opting  Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising You can opt out of many of the  platforms and service providers that facilitate online interest-based  advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer  education and opt-out page, at
http://www.aboutads.info/
.  This type of opt out is cookie based, which means that if you replace  or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to opt  out again. Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving  ads – it will just make the ads you see less customized to you.
Opting Out of “Cross-App” Advertising on Mobile Devices
You  can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for  certain types of interest-based (also called “cross-app”) mobile  behavioral advertising, by accessing the “settings” on your Apple or  Android mobile device, as follows:
Apple  Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of most app-based  tracking for interest-based advertising by setting Limit Ad Tracking to  ‘ON.’ You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy ->  Advertising and toggling Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON.’
Android  Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt out of most  app-based tracking for interest-based advertising by opening the Google  Settings app on your device, selecting Ads, and then selecting the  option to opt-out of interest-based ads.
Please  note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above  may change. Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described  above, you should check the settings for those devices.
Additional Choices
Advertisers  may also provide ways for you to opt out from or limit their collection  of information from and about you. Please refer to the privacy policies  for retailers, applications and websites to learn more about their  privacy practices.
You  may opt not to receive promotional emails from us by contacting us as  indicated below or by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any  promotional email you receive from us. Please note, however, that we may  still send you non-promotional emails about your relationship with us.
Data Access and Retention
Generally  speaking, we retain the SDK Information and Website Information for as  long as necessary to achieve our objectives as detailed in this Privacy  Policy, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and  enforce our agreements.
Data Security
We  have administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in place in our  physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and  communications networks that are designed to protect information  contained within our systems from loss, misuse, or alteration. No method  of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we  cannot guarantee absolute security of your Personal Information and  Non-Personal Information.
Third Party Websites and Apps
We  are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of  websites and applications that use our Services. Likewise, when you  access the OneSignal Website, you may be directed to other websites that  are also beyond our control. We encourage you to read the applicable  privacy policies and terms and conditions of such third parties and  websites, and the industry tools that we have referenced in this Privacy  Policy. This Privacy Policy, however, only applies to the OneSignal  Site and the Services.

If you are using the Site from outside the United States, be aware  that your Information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the  United States and other countries where our facilities are located. The  data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as  comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Site you consent to  your information being transferred to our facilities and to the  facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in  this Policy.
