        politically incorrect content, abuse and malicious advertisements, etc. If you wish to interact with other
        players through pictures, voice or video (if applicable to game functions), after obtaining your authorization

        research, or statistical purposes) if permitted by applicable data protection laws, or we may get your

You understand and
        agree that some of our Services may require you to enable specific permission on your device for the collection
        and use of your personal data. While the fact that we obtain a specific permission does not necessarily mean

        your personal data when necessary and in accordance with the Privacy Policy. You can disable any permissions at
        any time on the device. Please however note that once you close any permission, it means you have cancelled your
        authorization and we will no longer collect and use relevant data based on the corresponding permission, nor
        will we be able to provide you with the corresponding services. However, your decision to close your permission
        does not affect the collection and use of your personal data previously obtained under your
        authorization.

III. How We Disclose Your Personal
          Data
At times Sunborn Game may make certain personal
        data available to other companies that are wholly or jointly controlled by us (hereinafter as
        "
Affiliates
") and other third parties that work with
        Sunborn Game in order to provide Services to you.
• Affiliates: Your personal data may be shared
        with Sunborn Game's Affiliates for the purpose of rendering our Services to you. If Affiliates wish to
        process your personal data for a different purpose, they must first seek your consent, unless another lawful
        basis exists.
• Service Providers and Partners: Some of our
        Services will be provided with the assistance of third parties. We sometimes use third parties to control the
        collection of your personal data. For example, we may share your
t
ransaction
c
ard information (such as card number, expiration
        date, CVV) with payment service providers such as PayPal when you choose to use PayPal for payment processing on
        the Services. Similarly, we may share your user ID with social media platforms and other parties we partner with
        (e.g., Apple) when you choose to use social accounts to log into the Services or use Apple Pay on the Services.
        We may also share some personal data with our partners in particular so as to deliver you a better service and
        improve your user experience. For example, we may share your email address with advertising service providers
        who assist with marketing activities, such as displaying targeted ads, managing campaigns, tracking success, and
        analyzing performance to enhance your experience with relevant content.
• Purchasers and third parties in connection with
        a business transaction: Where a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy liquidation or similar action takes place, we
        may transfer or disclose your personal data following completion of such transaction and/or during the
        assessment process pending transfer. If transferred in such a case, your information would remain subject to
        this Privacy Policy or a privacy policy that, at a minimum, protects your privacy to an equal degree as this
        Privacy Policy.
• Law enforcement, regulators and other parties
        for legal reasons: We may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law, or if we reasonably
        believe that such action is necessary (a) to comply with a subpoena or other legal proceedings, legal actions or
        government agency requests; (b) when we believe in good faith that a disclosure is necessary to comply with the
        law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (c) to protect and exercise our legal claims, rights and
        property; (d) to protect your rights, property or personal safety or that of others; (e) to investigate fraud
        and (f) to protect the security or integrity of our Services.
• The public, when posted in certain public
        spaces: Some of our Services allow you to connect and interact with others. Your profile information or
        information that you post in a public space, including personal data, will be accessible to other users or the
        general public by default when you create it. Such content will be accessible by the general public or the
        members of the Services depending on the Services used.
Without your consent, we will not disclose your
        personal data to other third parties other than the above mentioned.
IV. How Your Personal Data Is Transferred
          Globally
Sunborn Game is a global business and our Services
        are spread around the world. As a result, we collect and transfer personal data on a global basis. That means
        that we may transfer your personal data to locations outside of your country. For more information, please
        contact us using the details set out in “Contact Us” section.
Please note that different countries or regions
        offer different levels of data protection. This means that your personal data could be stored in a country that
        offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal data than the
        country or region in which you are located. However, in such cases, we will take measures to ensure that the
        personal data we collect is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, and that your
        personal data is adequately protected. For example, we might ask your permission to transfer your personal data
        across borders, and we will implement adequate security measures and sign the necessary data
        transmission/sharing agreements with the recipients of your personal data prior to the transfer taking place. We
        will also specifically ensure that we comply with laws that require us to store data locally within a specific
        country or region. Specifically, this Game’s servers are located in the US, and our group locations and
        third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your
        Personal data, we may process it in any of these countries. In this case, we will take appropriate
        organizational and technical measures to ensure that your personal data is properly protected.
V. How Long We Keep Your Personal
          Data
We will only store your personal data for as long
        as necessary to achieve the collection purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless we have an ongoing
        legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested, to perform a
        contract with you or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.
After the expiry of the retention periods, we will
        delete or anonymize your personal data, if this is technically not possible (for example, because your personal
        data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal data and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.
VI. How We Protect Your Personal
          Data
We will adopt safety protection measures in line
        with industry standards, including establishing reasonable system standards and security technologies to prevent
        your personal data from being accessed, used or modified without authorization, and to avoid data leakage or
        loss.
The Internet is not an absolutely safe
        environment. We recommend that you use complex passwords and pay attention to protecting your information
        security. Please take good care of your account number, password and other identity elements. When you use our
        Services, we will identify you by your account number, password and other identity elements. Once you disclose
        the above information, you may suffer losses that may be detrimental to you. If you find that your account
        number, password and/or other identity information may or have been leaked, please contact us immediately so
        that we can take corresponding measures in time to avoid or reduce related losses.
When communicating with a third party or
        purchasing goods and services through our Service, you will inevitably disclose your own information, such as
        contact information or email address, to the counterparty or potential counterparty. Please protect your
        information properly and provide it to others only when necessary.
The Internet environment is not one hundred
        percent secure, and we will try our best to protect the security of any information you send to us. Please
        understand that due to technical limitations and risk prevention limitations, even though we have tried our best
        to strengthen security measures, we can't always guarantee one hundred percent information security. You
        need to know that the system and communication network you use to access our Service may have problems due to
        circumstances beyond our control.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the
        security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to us
        is done at your own risk. If we learn of a security system breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so
        that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the
services
or providing personal data to us, you agree
        that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating
        to your use of the
services
. We may post a Policy via our
Service
if a security breach occurs. We may also
        send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you
        live, you may have a legal right to receive Policy of a security breach in writing.
VII. Your Rights Regarding Your Personal
          Data
Data protection laws may give you a number of
        legal rights in relation to the personal data that we hold about you. Not all data protection laws are the same
        so not all of these rights apply in all places. Also, some of these rights are subject to qualifications and
        limitations and exercising these rights may impact on the Services that we can provide to you. However, we will
        take appropriate technical measures to enable you to control how we use your personal data where we can do
        that.
Subject to the data protection laws in your
        country, your rights may include:
1.
The right to be informed
: Sunborn Game provides this Privacy Policy to
        keep you informed about how your personal data is handled, the purposes for processing it, the categories of
        personal data collected, the recipients of this data, and the duration for which the data will be stored.

The right of portability
: In some circumstances, you have the right to
        receive some personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or request that we
        transmit this information to a third party where this is technically feasible. Please note that this right only
        applies to personal data which you have provided to us;
6.
The right to withdraw your
          consent
: You have the
        right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data. Please note, however, that we may still

        so. For example, we may need to retain your personal data to comply with a legal obligation;
7.
The right to object to or restrict
          processing
: You have the
        right to object to, and the right to request that we restrict, our processing of your personal data in certain

8.
The Right to Avoid Automated
          Decision-Making
: You have
        the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which
        produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, except under certain circumstances
        (such as when you have given explicit consent or when necessary for the performance of a contract).
9.
The Right to
          Non-Discrimination:
Under CCPA, Sunborn Game will not
        discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. This means we will not deny you goods or
        services, charge you different prices, or provide a different level or quality of services unless such
        differences are reasonably related to the value of your personal data.
10.
The right to lodge a
          complaint
: You have the
        right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority if you think that any of your rights have been

        account as otherwise state above, you can exercise your rights by contacting us using the details set out in the
        “Contac Us” section.
You may have some additional data protection
        rights according to applicable data protection laws in different countries or regions, if you wish to make such
        a request of data protection rights, please contact us by using the contact details provided under the “Contact
        us” heading below. However, please note, for data security purposes, before responding to your request, we may
        ask you to verify your identity and provide further details about your request to ensure that you are the right
        person to access such data or request to have other data rights.
We respond to all requests we receive from
        individuals wishing to exercise their personal data protection rights in accordance with applicable data
        protection laws.
In principle, we do not charge a fee for
        responding to your reasonable request. However, for multiple and repetitive requests that exceed a reasonable
        limit, we may charge a reasonable fee to cover some of our costs, depending on the nature of the request. We are
        entitled to refuse requests in whole or in part, and we may refuse requests that are manifestly unfounded,
        unreasonably repetitive or that require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests that require
        the development of new systems). In addition, we may not respond to requests that directly concern significant
        issues of public interest or may cause serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of you or other
        individuals or entities.

六、
我们如何存储和保护您的个人信息
1. 信息的存储
1.1
    存储时限。除法律法规或监管部门另有规定外，我们仅在本政策所述目的所必需且最短的时限内存储您的个人信息。超出存储期限后，我们会对您的个人信息进行删除或匿名化处理。
如我们终止服务或运营，我们将及时停止继续收集您个人信息的活动，同时会遵守相关法律法规要求以逐一送达或公告的形式通知您，并在终止服务或运营后对您的个人信息进行删除或匿名化处理，但法律法规或监管部门另有规定的除外。
1.2
    存储地点。我们在中国境内运营中产生和收集的个人信息，存储在中国境内。未经您的同意，我们不会将您的个人信息转移至中国境外（为了本政策的目的，中国指的是中国大陆，不包含香港、澳门和台湾）。
1.3 存储方式。我们会采取适当的数据安全措施存储您的个人信息。
2. 个人信息的保护
我们努力为用户的个人信息安全提供保障，以防止信息的泄露、丢失、不当使用、未经授权访问和披露等。
2.1 数据安全保护措施
我们会采用符合业界标准的安全防护措施，包括建立合理的制度规范、安全技术来防止您的个人信息遭到未经授权的访问、使用、修改，避免数据的损坏或丢失。
我们的服务采取了多种加密技术，例如在某些服务中，我们将利用加密技术（例如SSL、TLS）对您的个人信息进行加密保存，并通过隔离技术进行隔离，以保护您的个人信息。在个人信息使用时，例如信息展示、信息关联计算，我们会采用多种数据脱敏技术增强信息在使用中的安全性。我们还会采用严格的数据访问权限控制和多重身份认证技术保护个人信息，避免数据被违规使用。
我们通过信息接触者保密协议、监控和审计机制来对数据进行全面安全控制，我们仅允许有必要知晓这些信息的暗冬网络员工、合作伙伴访问您的个人信息，并为此设置了严格的访问权限控制和监控机制。我们同时要求可能接触到您个人信息的所有人员履行相应的保密义务。我们还会举办安全和隐私保护培训课程，加强员工对个人信息保护政策和相关规程的认识。
我们也为安全事件建立了的应急响应团队，按照安全事件处置规范要求，针对不同安全事件启动安全应急预案，进行止损、分析、定位、制定补救措施。在不幸发生信息安全事件后，我们将按照法律法规的要求，以邮件、信函、电话、推送通知等方式及时向您告知：安全事件的基本情况和可能的影响、我们已采取或将要采取的处置措施、您可自主防范和降低风险的建议、对您的补救措施等。难以逐一告知信息主体时，我们会采取合理、有效的方式发布公告。同时，我们还将按照监管部门要求，主动上报信息安全事件的处置情况。
2.2 数据安全保护的局限性
互联网并非绝对安全的环境，我们建议您使用复杂密码，并注意保护您的信息安全。请您务必妥善保管好您的账号、密码及其他身份要素。您在使用暗冬网络服务时，我们会通过您的账号、密码及其他身份要素来识别您的身份。一旦您泄露了前述信息，您可能会蒙受损失，并可能对您产生不利。如您发现账号、密码及/或其他身份要素可能或已经泄露时，请您立即和我们取得联系，以便我们及时采取相应措施以避免或降低相关损失。
在通过暗冬网络服务与第三方进行沟通或购买商品及服务时，您不可避免的要向交易对方或潜在的交易对方披露自己的信息，如联络方式或者邮寄地址等。请您妥善保护自己的信息，仅在必要的情形下向他人提供。
互联网环境并非百分之百安全，我们将尽力保护您发送给我们的任何信息的安全性。请您理解，由于技术的限制以及风险防范的局限，即便我们已经尽量加强安全措施，也无法始终保证信息百分之百的安全。您需要了解，您接入暗冬网络服务所用的系统和通讯网络，有可能因我们可控范围外的情况而发生问题。如果我们的物理、技术或管理防护设施遭到破坏，导致信息被非授权访问、公开披露、篡改或毁坏，导致您的合法权益受损，我们将在中国法律法规规定的范围内承担相应的法律责任。

8.响应您的上述请求
为保障安全，您可能需要提供书面请求，或以其他方式证明您的身份。我们可能会先要求您验证自己的身份，然后再处理您的请求，我们将在您完成身份验证后的15个工作日内做出答复。对于您合理的请求，我们不收取费用，但对多次重复、超出合理限度的请求，我们将视情况收取一定成本费用。对于那些无端重复、需要过多技术手段（如需要开发新系统或从根本上改变现行惯例）、给他人合法权益带来风险或者不切实际的请求，我们可能会予以拒绝。
八、
未成年人个人信息保护
我们高度重视未成年人个人信息的保护问题。我们会积极按照国家防沉迷政策要求，通过启用防沉迷系统保护未成年人的合法权益。我们会通过实名身份等信息校验判断相关账号的实名信息是否为未成年人，进而决定是否将此账号纳入到防沉迷体系中。另外，我们会收集您的登录时间、游戏时长等信息，通过从系统层面自动干预和限制未成年人游戏时间、启用强制下线功能、设置消费限额等方式，引导未成年人合理游戏，帮助未成年人健康上网。
若您是未成年人的法定监护人，请您关注您所监护的未成年人是否是在取得您的授权同意之后提供个人信息及使用暗冬网络服务。
如果您对您所监护的未成年人的个人信息有疑问，请通过本政策中的联系方式与我们联系。
特别地，若您是14周岁以下的儿童，我们还专门制定了《暗冬网络儿童隐私保护政策》，儿童及其监护人在使用暗冬网络服务之前，应仔细阅读《暗冬网络儿童隐私保护政策》。只有在取得监护人对本政策以及《暗冬网络儿童隐私保护政策》的同意后，14周岁以下的儿童方可使用暗冬网络服务。
九、
本政策的更新
我们向您提供的功能和服务是不断更新和发展的，更新的功能或服务可能未在前述说明中，但会涉及收集您的个人信息。
    法律法规的变化也可能导致本政策的修订。
    我们可能会根据暗冬网络服务的更新情况及法律法规的相关要求，适时修改本政策的条款。当本政策的条款发生变更时，我们会在版本更新时以页面提示、弹窗、网站公告等适当方式向您提供变更后的版本，并在法律要求的情况下，征得您的同意。您如果不同意该等变更，可以选择停止使用暗冬网络服务。
我们可能在必需时（例如当我们由于系统维护而暂停某一单项服务、变更、终止提供某一单项服务时）向您发出与服务有关的通知。如您不希望继续接收我们推送的消息，您可要求我们停止推送，例如，根据短信退订指引要求我们停止发送推广短信，或在移动端设备中进行设置，不再接收我们推送的消息；但我们依法律规定或单项服务的服务协议约定发送消息的情形除外。

Last updated August 6, 2021
Introduction
AppsFlyer provides attribution and marketing analytics services (“
Services
“) that enable advertisers and developers (collectively, “
Customer(s)
“) to: (i) measure and analyze the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by understanding which marketing campaigns contributed to the download/installation of their mobile applications (“
Applications
“) or such other conversion metric (e.g. relaunch of Application); and (ii) measure and analyze certain events and actions within their Application or websites, such as in-app purchases made by End Users (as defined below). The Services also help our Customers identify and protect against fraudulent behavior related to their marketing campaigns.
This Services Privacy Policy describes AppsFlyer’s privacy practices in relation to the information collected from Customers and End Users and received by AppsFlyer when Customers use our Services. This Services Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through use of AppsFlyer’s publicly accessible website or marketing activities, which is described under our Privacy Policy. To view the Privacy Policy, please
click here
. Furthermore, AppsFlyer and its Customers have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by AppsFlyer and their use by Customers (“
Agreement(s)
“). Such Agreements may contain additional obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information. Nothing in this Services Privacy Policy derogates from such additional obligations.
For the purpose of this Services Privacy Policy: (i) any reference to “
End User(s)
” means end users who have interacted with, or viewed, Customer’s advertising and marketing materials, or use or have used Customer’s Applications, websites, products and services; and (ii) any reference to “
AppsFlyer
” “
we
” “
us
” or “
our
” shall mean AppsFlyer Ltd. and its affiliates.
End User Data Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer uses the Services, the following End User information may be received and processed by AppsFlyer (collectively, “
End User Data
”).
“
Technical Information
”: this refers to technical information related to an End User’s mobile device or computer, such as: browser type, device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.
“
Technical Identifiers
”: this refers to various unique identifiers that generally only identify a computer, device, browser or Application. For example, IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices); Google Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique identifiers.
“
Engagement Information
”: this refers to information relating to the Customer’s ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer’s website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyze within their Application or website (e.g. add to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).
While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information (“
PII
“), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such. Within the scope of the engagement between Customers and AppsFlyer, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by AppsFlyer. However, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII. This includes, for example, a Customer using an End User’s email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier. If a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.
Registration Information Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer registers to use the Services, we may collect certain information related to such Customer (“
Registration Information
” and together with the End User Data, “
Customer Data
”), including Customer name and Customer details, billing information and names and contact details of Customer employees and representatives who are using the Services (e.g. email, phone number and address). When a Customer uses the Services, AppsFlyer may also collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Customer is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g. browser type, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Customer (“
Log Data
”).
How Data is Collected
Customer Data may be collected through various methods, including:
When provided voluntarily (e.g. Customer’s Registration Information).
When the Customer integrates AppsFlyer’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Applications, websites and/or ads (“
Collection Technologies
”). For explanations on cookies and similar technologies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Customer in connection with the measurement and analysis of Customer’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with AppsFlyer (“
Partners
”).
How Data is Used by AppsFlyer
When AppsFlyer receives End User Data from a Customer, it uses such End User Data as follows:
to provide such Customer with the Services they have subscribed for. Such services may include, without limitation, attribution, analytics and ad fraud protection services. Please visit
https://www.appsflyer.com
for more information regarding the Services.
to establish: (i) matches between devices used by an End User; and (ii) to detect fraud (such matched data and fraud data, collectively, the, “
Platform Data
”) in order to ensure more accurate attribution measurement and ad fraud protection for Customers using the Services. Platform Data does not contain PII such as End User names, physical addresses, phone numbers or other similar personal data that can directly identify an individual.
With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, we use such information to authenticate login to the Services, to communicate with the Customer and to process any payments in connection with the Services. Additionally, we may use: (i) Registration Information to inform Customers of any updates to the Services, including new features and functionalities; and (ii) Log Data to understand how Customers are using the Services so that we may efficiently audit, maintain and improve the Services provided to Customers.
AppsFlyer may use information derived from the aggregation of End User Data and/or Log Data with other data for research and analytics purposes and improvement and marketing of the Services (“
Aggregated Data
”). Aggregated Data shall be anonymous and in no way reveal the identity of the Customer or any End User.
Sharing Data
AppsFlyer does not share or disclose Customer Data with any third party, except:
Upon our Customer’s request– (e.g. to Partners);
To our subsidiaries and global branches as necessary to help us support and maintain the Services provided to Customers;
To our service providers who help to support our Services – such as data hosting providers and payment processors; Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
When legally required (e.g. court orders or other lawful requests by public authorities), including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
To respond to, or prevent, fraud or to protect the safety of AppsFlyer, its Customers, End Users or the public;
As part of any merger or acquisition of AppsFlyer, in which case End User Data may be transferred to the surviving or acquiring entity.
Cross Border Data Transfers
AppsFlyer may need to transfer Customer Data to countries other than the country from which the Data originated. Any such transfer shall be done in compliance with all applicable laws. With regards to the collection, use and retention of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States, please be assured that AppsFlyer continues to comply with all applicable laws in respect of such transfers and any data transfers to the United States will be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses as set forth in our DPA with the relevant service provider.
Protecting Data and Retention
AppsFlyer implements appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction or damage of Customer Data. For more information on our security controls, please see
https://www.appsflyer.com/trust/security/
. If you have questions about the security of your personal information, or if you have reason to believe that the personal information that we hold about you is no longer secure, please contact us immediately as described in this Services Privacy Policy.
AppsFlyer will not retain: (i) End User Data for more than twenty-four months except where otherwise directed by Customers or required or allowed by law; and (ii) Registration Information, Log Data or Platform Data for more time than is needed to serve the legitimate business need for which it was collected.
Relationship, Lawful Basis and End User Choices
Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, when processing End User Data in connection with the provision of Services to a Customer, AppsFlyer is deemed a ‘data processor’ while its Customers are deemed ‘data controllers’.
Therefore, End Users should closely review the Privacy Policies of the Applications and websites they use in order to learn about the privacy practices of our Customers.
Where AppsFlyer may be deemed a data controller under the laws of certain jurisdictions (e.g. in connection with its processing of Log Data or Registration Information), AppsFlyer shall comply with all applicable laws related to its status as a data controller and shall only use the data as described in this Services Privacy Policy. With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, the lawful basis AppsFlyer relies on is its need to perform its obligations under the Agreement between AppsFlyer and Customer and on its legitimate interests to maintain, analyze and improve the Services. The laws of certain jurisdictions may provide End Users with various rights in connection with the processing of End User Data, including:
The right to withdraw any previously provided consent;
The right to access certain information about you that we process;
The right to have us correct or update any Personal Information;
The right to have certain Information erased;
The right to have us temporarily block our processing of certain Information;
The right to have Information exported into common machine-readable format;
The right to object to our processing of Information in cases of direct marketing, or when we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis to process your information; and
The right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority.
Where AppsFlyer is deemed a data processor, End Users should contact our Customers to pursue any such legal data subject rights. AppsFlyer will cooperate with its Customers to support and comply with any such data subject rights requests.
Where AppsFlyer is deemed a data controller, End Users may exercise their rights by contacting AppsFlyer at:
privacy@appsflyer.com
. We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe. Please note these rights may be limited in certain circumstances as provided by applicable law. In any event, AppsFlyer provides End Users with the ability to opt-out of being measured by the Services by emailing a request to

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce

Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring
:

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).
