Privacy Notice
Polar respects your privacy and strives to offer you a safe customer experience. With this Privacy Notice we want to tell you about what data we collect when you use our products and services, and how we use and handle this data. We’ll also tell you where to find out more about how your personal information is handled and what rights you have with respect to this information.
“Polar” refers to Polar Electro Oy and its subsidiaries. Therefore, when you use Polar’s services or products, your information may be used and handled by one or more of Polar’s companies.

Cookie Policy
Using Polar services in short
When you use Polar services, we may collect your personal data. That data is used only to offer you the service in question, nothing else.
Polar does not disclose, give or sell your data to anyone unless we are required to do so pursuant to a mandatory provision of law.
We may use some of the data in research and development work to improve our services, but for such purposes data is cleared from identifiers to the maximum amount possible.
Polar is a globally operating company with customers all over the world. For this reason, in most cases your data is transferred out of your home country. Your data is stored on Polar ecosystem servers which are located in the EU/EEA area. Your email address or your user ID may on rare occasions be transferred outside the EU/EEA to the servers of our service providers for automatic notification purposes or for error reporting purposes. Even in those cases, service providers do not have access to your data.
When data is transferred it is done only for the purpose of providing the service. Your data is not disclosed or given to any third parties; it is still under Polar’s control and under your ownership.
How we handle your personal information
When you create a user account for Polar services, we ask for some personal information (for example your name, email address, gender and age). We need this information in order to provide you with a personalized experience with our services. For example, we use your age info to give you a more accurate calculation of burnt calories. If you give us false information about your gender, age, height or weight, our algorithms will not calculate correct results for you, and we therefore trust that all the information you give us to be accurate.
We may collect some information about you when you buy products from our webstore, use Polar’s services, or contact our
Customer Care
. If you only subscribe to Polar’s newsletter, the only information we ask for is your email address. We only process your personal information for the purposes listed in this Privacy Notice and for the service-specific purposes on which you can find more information by clicking on the links provided. You can also contact our
Customer Care
for more information on the handing of personal information with regard to each service.
When you use Polar products or services, Polar collects information about you and may combine that information to any other personal information Polar has collected about you for the same purpose. If we have collected information about you for other purposes, we do not combine these. In addition, we may use your personal information to ensure the proper functioning and safety of Polar products, to verify your identity, and to investigate frauds and other misuse of the products. We may also process your information as part of our research and product development activities – we’re continuously developing new functionalities and improving existing ones.
If you use any of our fee-based services, we can save your payment card information with your permission to facilitate further payments. This information is saved in encrypted format in a third-party system. We select our service providers carefully and ensure that they meet the requirements for safe and reliable handling of information set for that sector. When processing payment information, we comply with applicable legislation and the terms and conditions set and monitored by payment service providers.
If you wish, you may also share information from Polar’s services to systems or services offered by a third party, such as Facebook or Strava. Polar is not responsible for any information transferred elsewhere or for the accuracy of the information outside Polar’s system. Each service provider’s information security and privacy practices are applied to such information.
Security
There are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via the internet or other technologies, and no system or technology is completely safe or "tamper"/"hacker" proof. Polar uses appropriate technical and organizational security measures (such as encryption) and precautions to collect and process data and to prevent unauthorized access to and improper use of your personal data. If Polar sites support online transactions, they will use industry standard security measures to protect the confidentiality and security of these transactions. We use industry standard security measures, such as SSL authentication, to ensure that your credit card information, as well as other personal data submitted as part of the buying process, is appropriately safe from third-party interception.
How we handle sensitive personal information
The majority of Polar’s services are based on data collected on our products. Some of the collected data (such as heart rate data) is such by nature that we must ask for your permission to collect or process it. This permission is requested separately for each service that processes data that requires specific permission. The sensitive personal data that is processed depends on the service you are using and the device you have as different services and devices have slightly different capabilities and track different metrics. For a list of different sensitive personal data types and metrics processed in Polar services see our
Sensitive personal information
page.
Handling of personal information and its transfer outside the EU
Polar’s services and products may be delivered using resources and servers located in various countries. The actual service data (your account details and the data coming from your Polar devices) is stored on servers located in the EU/EEA area; Ireland and Sweden, but in some monitoring and ancillary activities of the Polar ecosystem (for example, sending automatic messages) customer email address or ID may be transferred to a service provider server outside the EU.
Therefore, your information may be processed outside the country that the service you are using is based in, including countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), where the standard of protection of privacy does not necessarily meet the requirements set by the European Commission (such as the U.S.).
When you register for a service (for example, Polar Flow) which may require transfer of information to another country for processing, we request your permission for the transfer. If and when transferring information, we comply with all applicable laws to guarantee sufficient protection of your privacy. In general, when transferring your personal data outside of EU/EEA, we apply the terms of the  EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), U.K.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or those of the agreements based on European Commission’s standard contractual clauses.
When data is transferred, the transfer is carried out only for the purpose of providing the service. Your data will not be disclosed or given to any third parties; it is still under Polar’s control and under your ownership. You can see all Polar service providers and their locations
here
. For more information on the transfer of information and related security measures, see our
FAQ section
. You may also contact us using the contact information provided below.
In line with the principles mentioned above, your information may be transferred or access to it may be permitted to Polar’s subcontractors (such as the supplier of our Customer Care system) that carry out tasks related to Polar’s website, products and services. Our subcontractors are not authorized to use the personal information for any other purpose and Polar’s subcontractors’ services are always covered by a confidentiality clause.
Polar never discloses any of your personal information without a separate permission from you, unless it is necessary for handling your order, carrying out your request, or managing our interactive customer programs. Information may, however, be disclosed if necessary because of law, a court order, or a regulation or request issued by authorities.
For statistical purposes, Polar may deliver collected anonymized statistical data on its customers, sales, traffic types, exercise information, and similar website information to reputable third parties. These statistics do not contain identifiable personal information.
Storage and accuracy of information
We want to keep our database up-to-date and we regularly delete out-of-date and unnecessary personal information. We only store the information as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or required by law. You can find more information on the retention times in the service-specific sections. You may also contact us using the contact information provided below.
In most of Polar’s services, you can manage your personal information yourself. We recommend that you check the accuracy of your information occasionally and correct it when necessary. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide.
Your rights
You always have the right to access your personal information
. In most of the services, direct access is possible, and when necessary, our
Customer Care
can assist you and deliver a copy of the personal information we have of you. You have the right to know what information pertaining to you has been collected, what this information is used for, and the parties, if any, that it has been disclosed to. To verify your identity in order to carry out your request, we may have to ask for additional information.
Polar is allowed to handle your personal information when the handling is based on a legitimate interest. We use this legal basis in some cases for our research and development activities as we constantly want to develop and improve our services.
You have the right to object to the handling of your personal information for these purposes.
You can opt out from handling of your data for research and development purposes at Polar Flow or account.polar.com services, or by sending a request to our
Customer Care
.
You always have the right to prohibit direct marketing.
If you have given your consent to receive marketing messages from Polar, you can stop receiving them by following the "unsubscribe" instructions within each email communication. If you have created a user account, you can do this directly via our service. Polar will not provide or share any mailing lists to third parties for promotional purposes. Emails related to services (to confirm a purchase, etc.) generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the service you requested. Such emails also include notifications about changes to our Privacy Notice and Terms of Use.
You have the right to have any of your information corrected or deleted
either by doing it directly yourself in Polar services or account.polar.com or by sending a request to our
Customer Care
. If you want to have your information deleted, we will delete your user credentials and all information and data pertaining to you. This includes data in all Polar services that you have used (e.g. Polar Flow and support services). The deleted data is not retrievable. After we’ve deleted your information, you can only use the service by creating a new user account. Some of your data, such as purchase data, will be retained for a certain period due to requirements of mandatory provisions of law.
According to law,
you have the right to refuse profiling and automated decision-making.
We may do categorizing of data when, for example, targeting marketing messages to you with your consent. However, that type of profiling has no significant effects on you, so it does not qualify as profiling as defined e.g. in the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU 2016/679 (GDPR). We also do not make any automated decisions about you or your behavior.
You can also request that the handling of your information be restricted
, also when you have prohibited the handling of your information and the assessment of the legal basis for the handling of your information has not been completed.
In some of our services we request your consent. We request consent only in cases when it is necessary for offering the service.
You have the right to withdraw your consent
at any time. The consent can be withdrawn within the service. Note that for some services, the withdrawal of consent prevents us from offering the service to you.
You have the right to receive your information from Polar’s systems
in a machine-readable format when handling of your information is based on your consent or on execution of an agreement. You can download your information directly on account.polar.com.
The right to data portability only applies to the data provided by you, not the derived data that you see in Polar Flow service that has undergone manipulation with Polar algorithms. You can read more about downloading data from Privacy
FAQ
page.
You can also request the transfer of your information to a third party.
Polar is not responsible for the third party’s system’s ability to process the information in the format that is used for the transfer.
If you suspect misuse of the information,
you may submit a complaint to the data protection ombudsman
or a similar authority. Contact information for data protection ombudsmen in various countries is available on our Privacy
FAQ
page.
Cookies and third parties
Polar uses web and mobile tracking techniques and targeted advertising. When you access sites under the Polar.com domain, you will be asked to consent to cookies and other tracking methods. Should you provide us your consent these methods will be used to collect device and network information, track your use of our services and possibly provide targeted advertising to you in our other sites or through our advertising partners. The analytics data will also be used to improve our services. You can read more about Polar’s use of cookies in our
Cookie Policy
.
Polar uses tools provided by Google, Facebook (such as Pixel, Conversion API, Custom Audience API), LinkedIn and Criteo. Nevertheless, no Polar related personal data is shared with these service providers without your permission. Read more here:

Polar uses Google reCaptcha in our legitimate interest to prevent misuse of our services. Using reCaptcha is essential for Polar service security. reCaptcha’s application programming interface (API) sends hardware and software information, including device and application data, back to Google for analysis. Google in turn uses the data analysis to fight spam and abuse. Read more in the
Google privacy policy
.
Some internet browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature. When used, this feature sends a signal to the online service that the user does not wish to be tracked. Polar services do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals, but our site visitors always have the manual choice of not accepting any cookies during their visit.
Using customer data in marketing
When you subscribe to a newsletter or register to Polar services, you are asked for your consent to receive marketing messages from Polar. If you give your consent you will receive messages from Polar which can be for example newsletters, information about new products and services or targeted advertisements in social media. Furthermore, you may be added to a custom audience on Facebook or you may receive targeted NPS (Net Promoter Score) questionnaires that are related to marketing and other material. We may target some material to certain user groups based on, for example, preferred sport or used device. Some material is targeted to certain geographical areas.
You can withdraw your marketing consent at any time either from the marketing messages you’ve received from Polar or from Polar services. Withdrawal of consent will clear your name from all Polar marketing lists it may be on.
Polar doesn’t sell or give customer data to any third parties for marketing purposes.
Using customer data in research and development
Sports science research is at the core of everything we do at Polar. We have an in-house Research Center comprising experts from biosignal technology, physiology, sports training, health and data science, and we carry out innovative studies related to wearable technologies, sports training, physical activity and sleep.
Different types of research
For development purposes inhouse research is being done by Polar continuously to develop new technologies, products and services and to improve the existing ones. New algorithms are being developed and tested, and customer mass data is being used to, for example, find anomalies in the features or to find devices that may not work properly. These results are not shared outside the company or published. They only support the in-house development work.
Some of the research is performed in co-operation with third-party research partners. The aim of research collaboration is to produce a scientific publication of the results and the actual research work is done according to an agreed research protocol and ethical requirements imposed on the study. In these studies, no customer data is given to the third-party research partners, but instead all data is processed within Polar and by a Polar research team. If any customer personal data is used in the research, customers are asked a separate informed consent to use their personal data for the specific research project.
Marketing research aims at better understanding of user groups of Polar devices and services, how the devices are being used and what new they may want. Marketing research is being performed by using data from users who have given their consent for marketing. Marketing research results (trends in customer behavior, favorite sports, etc.) may also be used when creating content for social media, for example Polar blog posts. To offer our customers the state-of-the-art knowledge in form of devices and services, we need data from our customers. The customer data used for research and development purposes is cleared from identifiers to the maximum amount possible.
Error logs
To offer the best possible service in the event of a problem, we store error data on our devices (“Error log”). When you synchronize your device with Polar’s service, the Error log is copied onto our server and saved there for a period of two years at maximum.
The Error log is only used for error analysis and statistical purposes on the basis of our legitimate interest. It can be used for example when you contact our
Customer Care
about an error or crash on your device. The only personal identifier on the Error log is the device ID which is needed to link the log to the correct device.
Telemetry logs
Some Polar devices may collect telemetry data from the device. The legal basis for collecting telemetry data is our legitimate interest. Telemetry data includes data about the functions and status of the device such as battery life, statistical data about synchronization, statistics about USB connections, display, OHR usage etc. The only personal identifier in the telemetry log is the Device ID. The data collected in the telemetry log is used in Polar development to improve the performance of Polar devices and to get a better understanding on the average use of the devices. Like the error log, the telemetry log may be used during repair or other error situation management by Customer Care. The telemetry logs are transmitted to Polar servers during synchronization of data to the service. The Device ID is hashed (one way) so that there are no clear identifiers in the data that is being processed at Polar's end. The data is retained for 60 days before being automatically deleted. This data cannot be deleted on request, only via automation. If this feature is being applied in your device, you can choose to deny the transmission of telemetry logs by opting out from handling of your data for research and development purposes at Polar Flow or account.polar.com services.
Users under 13 years of age
Our policy is to request that customers under the age of 13 do not make purchases or engage in other legal acts on Polar websites without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. For example, a user account for a Polar service can only be created for a user under 13 years of age with permission from a guardian.
Third-party devices
There are some third-party devices that are compatible with Polar services. The calculations shown in Polar services depend on the data you synchronize from your device to Polar services. Hence, the third-party device you have affects the data types shown in Polar services and the accuracy of the displayed data. To enable and support cooperation and business with third-party device manufacturers, Polar may provide them with anonymized statistical data, such as the quantity of third-party devices used in Polar services or third-party device usage statistics.

Polar Flow and Flow App
Polar Flow is a free cloud-based fitness and training app and web service that helps you track your training, activity and sleep data as well as analyze your progress. It works together with your Polar product and acts as your automatic training diary: all your training, activity and sleep data syncs from your product to your Polar Flow account.
Before you can start using the service you must create a user account through a registration process. During the registration process we ask for your approval of the Terms of Use and consents to some mandatory processing activities. These processing activities are mandatory for a reason: they are necessary to provide you with the service. These consents are also asked in order to meet the requirements of laws of multiple jurisdictions related to protection of privacy. If you do not want to give one or more of the mandatory consents, unfortunately then we cannot offer you the service. With a few exceptions (sensors and some old devices), you have an option to use your device in stand-alone mode. Consents are not generic. By giving a specific consent you grant Polar a permission to handle your data exclusively for the specified purpose, nothing else.
Before registering for Polar Flow, you need to read the service’s Terms of Use and Polar’s Privacy Notice. You will be asked to approve the service’s Terms of Use. By approving the Terms of Use, you enter into agreement with Polar. We will also ask you to indicate that you have read Polar’s Privacy Notice.
We would like to keep you up to date on all our news, offers and updates, so we’ll also ask for consent for marketing messages. Refusal is always the default setting for this request. You can change your selections anytime from your account settings. Read more about how we use your data in marketing
here
.
We ask for your consent for the handling of your personal information. This information is the data you give during registration: email, name, age, height, sex, training background and location. This data is used to provide you with accurate personal calculations such as calories burnt and Training Benefit feedback. You do not need to give your real name, but the name you give is the one shown if you share your exercises or comment on any of our communities. We use your location information mainly to identify your language. Location information is also used to direct your Customer Care requests to the correct Customer Care location so that you will receive support with correct language. Your email address is your account name and we may use your email to identify you later if you contact our Customer Care. For this purpose, please use an email address that you have access to and that is operational (not an alias). We will also send all important notifications to that email. You can change your email address at any time, so you are not forever stuck with the email you provide to us during registration process.
We ask for your consent to handle sensitive personal data. In Polar’s case, sensitive data refers to heart rate data—information received from the device or sensor you use. The Polar Flow service relies on this data, and without it, the service cannot be provided. See all types sensitive data types and related metrics in our
Sensitive Personal Information
.
We also ask for your consent for the transfer of your data to a country other than your home country. Polar uses servers provided by third parties to produce the Polar Flow service, and these servers may be located either within the EU or outside of it. The actual user data is stored on servers located within the EU but information such as the system’s monitoring data or automatic email notification data is saved on service providers’ servers thay may be located outside the EU. That data might have your email or user ID data in it. You can read more about data transfer and related protective mechanisms
here
.
For persons under the age of 13, we request consent for the handling of data from a guardian.
During the registration process, you will receive a message to verify your email address and confirm that the account was created intentionally. You must verify your email address within 24 hours, or your data will be lost and you will need to start the account creation process again. Once you have verified your email address, you can finish creating your account and sign into it. If you later wish to change the email address registered to your account, you will also have 24 hours to verify your new email address; otherwise, the change will be reversed.
When you create a user account, your privacy settings are private by default and your information is not displayed to other users. If you wish, you may share information on Polar’s services to third-party systems, such as Facebook or Strava. Polar is not responsible for customer shared data once it is transferred out of Polar’s system, and we no longer have any influence on the data. You are responsible for managing the information you share or transfer out of the system so read third party privacy statements carefully.
As Polar strives to continuously develop its services, the exercise data you save in the Polar Flow service may be used to realize Polar’s
legitimate interests
in research and product development. Read more about data use in research and development
here
. The information may also be used for sending marketing messages if you have granted permission for this, either in connection with registration or at a later date. These marketing messages are usually targeted to a certain age or location group, certain sports group or users of some specific Polar product.
Currently, the information is stored in the Polar Flow service until you decide to delete your account. If you withdraw any of the mandatory consents, or you haven’t verified your email address linked to your account (either because you have created an account without verifying your email address, or you have changed email address before August 21, 2024) your account will be locked for 180 days and then transferred to a removal cycle where your account and all of your data will be permanently deleted after 30 days. If we make any changes to our data storage periods, we will notify you.
Polar Flow mobile app
To use the Polar Flow app, you must first create a Polar Flow account. You then use your Polar Flow username to log on to the Polar Flow app. All your training data is transferred directly to the Polar Flow service’s server and no information is stored in the Polar Flow app. Polar Flow’s Privacy Notice is applied to the handling of data.
If you create a Flow account using the Flow mobile app, the email verification process differs from when you create an account via a web browser. After completing the account creation, you will receive an email to verify your address and confirm that the account was created intentionally. The account must be verified within 30 days. If it is not verified within this time frame, it will be locked and cannot be used. After 210 days, the account will be deleted. During this 210-day period, you can verify your email or request a new verification email at any time.
Some settings that may impact your privacy when using the Polar Flow app are phone related. A good example is notifications: if you wish to enable them on your wrist-worn device, your phone’s settings need to allow this. Or, if you wish to get in-training voice guidance through Polar Flow app, you can get it with your headphones or phone speaker. Please study the settings on your phone and select ones that work best for you.

Support/Customer Care
Polar’s Customer Care helps you with any problems you may have with our products or services. Our Customer Care maintains two registers: Contact us form and Service. Information is saved to both of these via the Polar.com website. Customers fill the necessary information in the forms themselves and the information sent with this form is saved in a third-party customer service system. The third party in this case is a service provider only: it is Polar that uses the customer service system and the information in it. The data stored in Polar’s systems may be saved on servers located in Finland or on Polar’s service providers’ servers either within or outside the EU. Read more about the transfer of data and related protective mechanisms
here
. Polar’s Customer Care operates globally in various countries to ensure that we can offer support services in several countries and time zones.
The Contact us form
: the information recorded in this form is transferred to a third-party Customer Care system used by Polar. This system is available to all Polar’s Customer Care personnel. The data recorded in the system is stored on the service provider’s servers located in the EU. On this form, you are asked to provide your contact information (such as an email address and country) to enable us to respond to your query. Your information is handled confidentially, and the service provider does not have access to the actual data. The information is stored for 10 years unless the local legislation requires longer storage, or you request for the data to be deleted.
Service
: the information recorded on this form is used for connecting the device and its owner, delivering a serviced device or ordered spare part to the customer, invoicing and handling payments, sending address stickers for returns, sending automatic email messages with regard to the progress and completion of service, submitting additional requests related to service, and providing a cost estimate for service. Data from the Service form is transferred to Polar’s global Service system. Address information is also transferred to external postal services for the delivery of the products. The information is stored for 10 years unless the local legislation requires longer storage.
Sending your device to repair service
When you send your device to Polar for repair service, Polar repair service personnel may need to view the training history on the device in question. Sometimes this will require also looking at the training sessions recorded with the device in question on your Flow account. Our repair service personnel will not look at your personal details, only the training sessions that may be causing problems. All our personnel are well trained in privacy and they will treat your data with utmost consideration and respect.
If you send your device to repair service via Polar retailer, your personal information will only be used to carry out the repair service operation and to return your device to you.
Calling our Customer Care
Any calls to Polar’s Customer Care may be recorded in some of the countries. The number you are calling from is recorded in our Customer Care system and in the telephone system. The log information is stored for six months.
You can also contact Polar’s Customer Care through social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, and Google Play) and via a chat service (not available in all countries). These contact events are recorded in the Customer Care system.

Webstore and online payments
Polar’s webstore is a public retail service where you can buy a product either as a registered customer or as a guest. For webstore infrastructure, Polar follows the requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) program. To enable the delivery of the product, we save the address information you provide and your email address so that we can keep you up to date on the progress of the delivery. We will also contact you at your email address to ask for feedback on your customer experience. This helps us to improve our service. If you create a customer account in connection with placing an order, we store this data to assist with any further purchases.
The actual payment is made via a third-party payment system. Online payments are made directly by the customer using internet payment services provided by the payment system provider(s). Polar employees will not be involved at any point in accepting payments via this method. The only information saved in Polar’s system for the payment event is the payment method information and, for B2B products (Polar Club, Polar Team Pro), also the tokenized credit card number. With payments related to Polar Club and Polar Team Pro, we ask for your consent to store the credit card credentials.
Sometimes we may run promotions that entitle you to receive a free store gift when you make a purchase in our webstore. That store gift may, for example, be a free trial period to a digital service provided by our partner. In such cases, Polar does not share any of your personal information with our partners. Instead, we send you the necessary information by email, such as a code needed to redeem the store gift from our partners. Please note that our partners may request your personal information to provide their digital services. We strongly recommend reviewing their privacy policy before sharing any personal information. It is entirely your decision whether to redeem your store gift or provide your personal information to our partners.
Polar stores some information, such as the IP address used by you, in its system for some time on the basis of
legitimate interest
in order to ensure the security of the service. The legal basis for processing your personal data in Polar Webstore or in connection with other online payments is performance of a contract.
The purchase information is stored for 10 years unless the local legislation requires longer storage.
You can contact our
Customer Care
for further information on the webstore’s register.
Polar Retail and Distributor Webshops
Polar Retail and Distributor Webshops are platforms where Polar retailers and distributors can place their orders. To use the Polar Retail or Distributor Webshop, retailers and distributors will either receive account details from Polar or they can create one or several user accounts themselves. The only collected personal information is the retail or distributor contact person’s name and email address associated with each user account.
Each retailer and distributor can manage their own user accounts themselves in the Polar Retail or Distributor Webshop: this includes creating and disabling their user accounts. The legal basis for processing the above-mentioned personal data is performance of a contract.
Polar Club
Polar Club is a heart rate-based group fitness and exercise app that enables tracking and displaying club members' real-time performance data, such as heart rate, intensity and calories burned, during an exercise class. The participants’ workout summaries will automatically upload to Polar Flow where they can keep track of their progress and reach their goals. When a fitness club purchases Polar Club, it signs an agreement with Polar. Under this agreement, Polar acts as the data processor while the club is the data controller. The club is responsible for what information is saved in the system and how it is handled. The club is also responsible for the accuracy of the users’ information and data-related requests by individual users (such as requests to delete the information).
Information on the clubs that use the service is collected in the Polar Club register. A username is created for the administrator designated by the club (Club Admin). For this, the person’s email address is saved in the system.
Information on exercise classes is stored on the club’s iPad for a month. Other data saved on the device includes the participants’ training-related data and an electronic ID code to identify the individuals, which can be used to connect the username used in the registration to the Flow database. With this ID code, participants’ training data can be transferred to their personal Flow account. The club’s staff cannot identify users on the basis of these ID codes. The instructor’s ID data is also stored on the iPad. Participants’ actual Flow usernames are not stored on the iPad. All the user information stored under the Flow username is located in the
Flow service
, and the club does not have access to these accounts. The Polar Flow service’s data is saved on Polar’s service provider’s servers. These servers may be located either within the EU or outside it. Read more about data transfer and related protective mechanisms
here
.
Customers may participate in exercise classes via their existing Flow account, by creating an account in conjunction with signing up for the class, or by signing up as a Visitor.
Customers with a Flow account:
The customer can sign up for a Club exercise class using an existing Flow account. Alternatively, the user can create a Flow account in conjunction with signing up. No personal information provided in connection with the creation of the Flow account is stored on the iPad. The only information stored on the iPad is the participants’ electronic ID and exercise data. The exercise data of the customers who use their Flow account to sign up for the class is automatically transferred from the club’s iPad to the Polar Flow service using the ID code.
Customers who sign up as a Visitor:
Customers may also sign up for Club exercise classes as a Visitor, in which case the participants provide a name they want to have displayed on the screen during the class, such as a nickname or any other ID (e.g. a word or a string of characters). No personal information is collected or saved. Participants who signed up as Visitors may store their exercise data after the class by creating a Flow account or using an existing Flow account.
The Polar Club solution also offers clubs and their customers a channel for discussing the exercise classes and other similar matters within the club’s own community. The Community service can be found in Flow’s
Community -
Clubs
section. When participating in discussions in the service, the participants may share information related to them if they so wish. When necessary, the club is responsible for moderating the discussions.
The legal basis for processing personal data is performance of a contract. You can contact our
Customer Care
for further information on Polar Club’s register.
Polar Team Solutions
Polar Team Pro
Polar Team Pro is a player monitoring solution for professional sports teams. It combines GPS and motion monitoring data with heart rate information. With Polar Team Pro, the coach can monitor the team’s training session via an iPad (must be bought separately) without a base station or antenna. Training data can also be collected after training by syncing the Team Pro Sensors via Team Pro Dock. Monitoring of players’ performance offers valuable and accurate information to assist the coaching team in its analysis work.
When a team buys Polar Team Pro, it signs an agreement with Polar on the use of the service. Under this agreement, Polar acts as the data processor while the team is the data controller. The team is responsible for what information is saved in the system and how it is handled. The team is also responsible for the accuracy of the information and data-related requests by individual players (such as requests to delete the information).
Polar Team Pro collects data on the teams that use the service and their members. A username is created for the administrator designated by the team (Team Pro Admin). For this, the person’s email address is saved in the system. We will send a message to verify the email address and to confirm that the account was created intentionally. The account must be verified within 30 days in order to use Polar Team Pro. The administrator creates a team in the system by adding the team members’ information (such as the player number, name, and date of birth) in the Team Pro service. The data is saved on the server of Polar’s service provider. Training data is saved on the team’s iPad for two months at the most and transferred from there to the Team Pro service. Individual players’ personal Polar Flow accounts can be connected to the Team Pro service, where the coach can view them. The individual Polar Flow accounts are located in the Polar Flow service from where the data is saved on Polar’s service provider’s servers. These servers may be located either within the EU or outside it. Read more about data transfer and related protective mechanisms
here
.
For customer support purposes, the Polar Team Pro mobile app collects data to an error log that is solely stored in your iPad. If the app crashes or is unresponsive and unstable, you can choose to send the error log to Polar Customer Care. The error log is only used for error analysis and statistical purposes. The error log contains identifiers for the team (name, id), its members (players' name, number, id, role, email), and sensors (name, id). The error log is encrypted and can only be accessed with Polar's encryption key.
The legal basis for processing personal data is performance of a contract. You can contact our
Customer Care
for further information on the Polar Team Pro register.
Polar Team
The Polar Team app is a player monitoring solution that provides real-time heart rate data for indoor team sports with Polar heart rate sensors and an iPad (must be bought separately).
Polar does not collect or store any personal information via Polar Team. All data is stored on the iPad.
Polar Team Pro API
Polar Team Pro API is an interface that allows Team Pro data to be transferred to a third-party system. Team Pro admin user may connect Team Pro service with a third-party platform to allow data to be transferred between the services. This data may include players personal training data as well as data from team training sessions.
Polar GoFit
Polar GoFit is designed for students, teachers and school staff to enable them to view and measure the students’ heart rates and physical activity levels and to perform physical ability measurements in schools. The Polar GoFit service consists of the Polar GoFit application, Polar GoFit website (www.polargofit.com), and Polar’s heart rate and activity devices compatible with GoFit.
When a school purchases GoFit, it enters into an agreement with Polar or its representative. Under this agreement, Polar acts as the data processor while the school is the data controller. As the data controller, the school is responsible for what information is saved in the system and how it is handled. The school is also responsible for the accuracy of the students’ information and data-related requests by individual students (such as requests to delete the information). The school is also responsible for requesting permission from the student or, in case of a minor, their guardians before adding a student to the service.
Information on the teachers and students who use the service is saved in the GoFit register. A username is created for a contact teacher designated by the school (and for any additional teachers). For this, the person’s name and email address are saved in the system. The teacher adds the student's user profile information such as name, date of birth, height, weight, gender and class in the system after receiving permission from the guardians. All this data is needed for the system and the algorithms to work correctly. When using the system, Polar devices or sensors collect exercise data which is sent to the GoFit server. This data is used to calculate information such as burnt calories and activity. In some cases, the teacher has some choice on what data is visible for users. For example, calories can be hidden from the screen from both the GoFit application and web service, but they will be saved among other exercise data to the database. The teacher can also select whether to show a student's name or student ID on GoFit application. The student ID is decided by the school and can consist of numbers and letters. Students may also use their accounts independently to view their exercise data, for example.
GoFit training data is stored on the service provider’s servers. These servers are located either in the EU or the U.S. Read more about the transfer of data and related protective mechanisms
here
. When necessary and with permission from the student or, in case of a minor, their guardian, information may be shared to a third party within the school environment. When necessary, information may be shared to a third party for purposes agreed on separately.
The information is deleted from the GoFit system when the agreement between Polar and the school expires.
The legal basis for processing personal data is performance of a contract. You can contact our
Customer Care
for further information on the Polar GoFit register.
Polar API/Polar Open AccessLink
Polar Open AccessLink is Polar’s proprietary application programming interface (API) that provides a direct information sharing link between the Polar ecosystem and third-party data systems. With Polar Open AccessLink our customers may transfer data related to their personal info, training and physical activity from Polar devices and the Polar Flow system to a third-party system that appears on the list of available systems, such as other fitness and training apps. Polar customers may also transfer similar data from third-party systems to Polar devices and Polar Flow (this feature may not be available at the time this version of Privacy Notice becomes active).
For third party developers:
To third-party systems, Polar offers the Polar Open AccessLink interface and instructions that enable the third party to register its own application in the Polar system and to develop a feature for receiving data.
The developers use their
Polar Flow
usernames to log in to the Polar API/Polar Open AccessLink service. A new application is registered by providing information on the application and the company. Approval of Terms of Use is required. No personal information is collected in connection with registration; instead the application is linked to the Flow account used for the registration. Several applications can be linked to the same Flow account.
Users are responsible for linking the third-party services they want to use with their Polar Flow account. The information is retrieved by the third-party services or sent by Polar Electro when the user synchronizes data to the Polar Flow service or when user transmits sensor data to third party. Polar is not responsible for data once it is transferred out of Polar’s system and it no longer has any influence on the data. Users are responsible for managing the information they share or transfer out of the system.
You can contact our
Customer Care
for further information on the Polar Flow register.
Collaborators
Polar engages in commercial co-operation with Collaborators who create content for Polar’s social media channels. Polar maintains a registry of individuals who have expressed interest to become a Collaborator. Potential candidates are contacted to negotiate a Collaborator agreement. During the agreement process, Collaborators are also informed about the collection and processing of their personal information as part of the co-operation.
Polar collects certain personal information from candidates interested in becoming a Collaborator to assess their suitability and to contact them. This includes first and last name, age, city, country, email address, and a list of the social media channels the Collaborator candidate uses. The source of this information is the Collaborator candidate themselves. The information is stored for two years. Information is transferred outside the EU, specifically to U.S. The legal basis for processing Collaborator candidates’ personal information is consent. You can contact Polar’s Social Media team at
polar.community@polar.com
directly or
Polar Customer Care
for more information on the co-operation with Collaborators and the processing of candidate information.
Testing
Quality assurance and testing are ongoing activities aimed at ensuring the high quality and user experience of Polar products and services. Polar also conducts test projects in which Polar users are invited to participate. Polar maintains a registry called the Beta Tester Bank, which consists of users who have expressed their interest and willingness to participate in testing projects. When a suitable test project arises, a group of potential Beta testers is contacted and asked if they would like to participate in the project. If a Beta tester expresses interest in joining the test project, a test agreement is established with conditions, responsibilities, and possible compensation outlined for the project. During the creation of a test agreement, Beta testers are also informed about the collection and processing of their personal information within the test project.
The legal basis for processing personal information in the Beta Tester Bank is consent. The processed personal data includes the Beta tester's name, age, gender, and contact details, all of which are provided by the Beta tester themselves. Beta testers' age and gender may be used to select suitable participants for a test project, and their contact information is used to invite them when a suitable project becomes available. Beta testers' information is retained for a period of two years, with the possibility of extension for additional two-year periods if a Beta tester remains interested in testing and agrees to Polar retaining their data for another period. The Beta Tester Bank is stored in the European Union (EU).

We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices

Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.

GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf

Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads

Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

What is EU GDPR?
EU GDPR is an abbreviation of the words European Union General Data Protection Regulation. It refers to the data protection regulation of the European Union, which is enforced since May 2018. The purpose of the regulation is to harmonize the data protection practices of the EU countries and organizations operating in the EU and to improve data security for the citizens of the member states.
Why do I have to verify my email address? What happens if I don’t do that?
By verifying your email address, we make sure that no one else is using your email address behind your back and that it is really you who is using Polar services. User identification is also a requirement in data protection laws in many countries.
Once you receive the verification email, you have 12 hours to verify your email address. If you create a new account, but don’t verify your email address in the 12-hour time frame, you will need to start the account creation process again. Similarly, if you change your Polar account’s email address and you don’t verify your email address in the 12-hour time frame, the change will get reversed, and you will need to update your email address from start again. Both the account creation and the email change processes will only be finalized and confirmed once you have verified your email address.
If you don’t receive the verification email, please check your spam folder. If you still haven’t received the verification email, even after requesting a new one, please contact our Customer Care.
If you created your Polar account before August 20, 2024 (this the moment when we changed our email verification policy) and you haven’t verified your email address, your account is locked and then deleted after seven months. There is a six-month grace period during which you can still verify your email and stop the user account deletion process. If you don’t act, then there is the actual deletion period which takes one month, and altogether this process takes seven months.
Where can I find the contact information of the data protection authority in my country?
For EU countries, this information can be found on the website of the EU:
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm
.
What is a Polar account?
It’s the user account that you use to log in to Polar Flow. Your username is your email address, and you can only create one Polar account with the same email address.
In addition to Polar Flow, your Polar account also works with the Polar Newsletter subscription and Polar Club. This means that if you’ve subscribed to the Polar Newsletter or used Polar Club at some point, you’ve created a Polar account at that time.
Note that you cannot sign in to the Polar webstore with your Polar account. The Polar webstore account and Polar account are two different accounts.
How many registered Flow users are there?
Unfortunately, we cannot disclose this information as it is covered by corporate security.
What are Polar’s subsidiaries and subcontractors?
The Polar Group includes many different companies around the world, but mostly within the EU. With the help of the subsidiaries, Polar can, for example, work more comprehensively in different language areas. All of Polar’s subsidiaries work together with Polar for the benefit of the customers.
Polar also uses subcontractors to some extent, for example to produce services, service infrastructure etc. We only use trusted partners who are bound by confidentiality. See the list of our subcontractors
here
.
Why did I receive a newsletter about changes to the privacy notice despite the fact that I have not subscribed to it?
The message you received is not a newsletter. In some situations, Polar has a legal obligation to inform all users of changes to, for example, our Terms of Use or our Privacy Notice. These messages are sent to all users, not only those who have subscribed to our newsletter.
How can I cancel my newsletter subscription?
An option to cancel the newsletter subscription is provided at the end of all newsletters from Polar. You can also refuse marketing messages in the settings of the Polar Flow service or at
account.polar.com
. You can do this (or check whether this setting is already active) by logging into the Flow service. Click on your name to edit your profile. Select Settings – Privacy and check that Newsletter is not selected.
Are the previous versions of your Privacy Notice and Terms of Use available on your website?
You can compare the previous and current legal texts at:
https://www.polar.com/en/legal/privacy-notice (current Privacy Notice)
https://www.polar.com/en/legal/privacy-notice/previous (previous versions)
https://www.polar.com/en/legal/terms-of-use (current Terms of Use)
https://www.polar.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/previous (previous versions)
What are the consents that I need to give?
These consents are not only required in the data privacy standards of many countries, but they also help you understand how we use your data.
The consents are divided into two groups. Firstly, there are the mandatory consents which are separated into smaller entities because of legal reasons. You need to give these consents to be able to use Polar services. You can also withdraw them at any time, but you should be aware that this will prevent you from using Polar services, and after six months your account and all your data will be deleted permanently. We will notify you by email two weeks before the deletion, and you still have a chance to give the consents and cancel the deletion.
These are the mandatory consents:
Consent to use your personal information: email, age and location. This is information that you give us when creating a Polar account. We use it to provide you with accurate personal calculations such as burnt calories and Training Benefit feedback.
Consent to handle your sensitive personal data. Together with personal information sensitive personal data makes up the fuel that the algorithms need to provide you with individual calculations. In Polar’s case sensitive personal data refers to heart rate data, activity data and sleep data, in other words health data that our products and services collect from you.
Consent to transfer your data outside your home country. Polar is a global company that offers and supports services all over the world. Most of our customer data is hosted on servers located in the EU (e.g. Ireland and Sweden). However, some monitoring and remote work is done elsewhere. We use highly reputable and secure world class data storage platforms. All the partners involved in providing Polar services to our customers are chosen carefully.
Consent from the guardian of a young person (under 13 years of age). Customers who are under 13 years of age need consent from their guardian to use Polar services.
Secondly, there is one voluntary consent for marketing communication.
Consent to send marketing messages. We want to bring to your attention new features, system enhancements, updates and ways to get the most out of your Polar product, as well as inform you about new Polar products and exclusive offers to Polar customers. You can withdraw this consent at any time and this will have no impact on your Polar product and Polar account use.
As a user of Polar services and products, you may also receive important notices about them from time to time. These important notices related to the use of products and services are not marketing messages, but are essential information concerning our products and services and their use. For this reason, it is not possible to opt out of receiving them. We also inform all our customers – including those who have opted out of marketing messages – of any changes to our Terms of Use or Privacy Notice. We hope you read these messages, because they may contain important information that applies to you.
In addition to the consents described above, you can decide whether you want to contribute your data, used with a pseudonymous, to Polar’s research and development. Sports science research is at the core of everything we do. Our in-house Research Center comprises experts from biosignal technology, physiology, sports training, health, and data science. This team carries out innovative studies related to wearable technologies, sports training, physical activity, and sleep. Based on this in-house research, the company develops new technologies, products, and services, plus improves existing ones. Using pseudonymized user data, our research and development teams create algorithms and test features to find errors or anomalities in products and services. These results are not shared outside the company or published, and only support our in-house development work. Customer data is of outmost importance to this development work and consequently, we always handle it with care, respect and in a subtle manner. Data is always pseudonymized, without any identifiers. We also want to respect your privacy; therefore, you have a right to refuse Polar from using your data for research and development purposes. If you exercise this right, we will not include your data in our development work.
What happens if I do not give the consents to use my personal data?
If you withhold any of the mandatory consents, you won’t be able to use our services anymore, and your account and data will be deleted after six months. We will notify you by email two weeks before the deletion, and you still have a chance to give the consents and cancel the deletion.
If you want to withdraw any of the consents once you have given them, you can always do so on the Settings page in Polar Flow or at
account.polar.com
. However, please note that this will prevent you from using our services.
The consent to receive marketing messages and refusing from processing your data for Polar’s research and development purposes are voluntary, and they do not affect your use of our products or services.
Why do I have to tick so many boxes and give so many consents to be able to use Flow?
The consents and agreeing to the new Terms of Use are there for making sure that you, Polar customer, feel safe with your data. We do not ask you to agree to the Privacy Notice, we only want you to check the box to let us know you have read the Privacy Notice that explains what we do with your data.
I do not accept your terms of use or agree to your privacy notice and wish to use only some of the services. Is this possible?
Unfortunately, it is not possible to use Polar Flow without accepting the Terms of Use and acknowledging that you have read the Privacy Notice. Some of our devices can also be used without Polar Flow, but in that case, some of the features will not be available. You will also not be able to synchronize your data with our service or update the firmware version of your device.
What information do you have about me?
You can review your data directly in the Polar Flow service (
https://flow.polar.com
). Your account information and all data concerning your Polar products and use of the services come directly from you. We store the information you have provided (e.g. when creating your Polar account or editing your information) and data that we obtain from your registered Polar devices. When you synchronize a registered device with the Flow service, the data in the device is stored. You can also add and edit your information in the Flow service and the Flow mobile application. If you do not want to use the Flow service, you can ask our Customer Care to send your account information to you.
If you would like to review any other information we may have about you (such as your purchase history, Customer Care contact history, or service history), contact our Customer Care.
How can I remove all my data from your database and close my account?
You can delete your account yourself at
account.polar.com
. Log in with your username and password and click on “Close your account” on the left to access the Close account button. Click the button to proceed and the portal will guide you through the process. This procedure removes your Polar Flow account and data.
If you have also e.g. had your device repaired or serviced, made purchases in the Polar webstore, or been in contact with Customer Care, and you want to have all data related to these removed, please contact Polar Customer Care so that we can initiate the deletion process. Deleting everything happens in two parts.
The Polar Flow account removal is a process that takes one month from beginning to end. Two weeks after your deletion request you’ll get an automated notification reminding you that the final deletion is going to happen in two weeks. At that point you can still cancel the removal process. If you don’t do anything, your account and all your training data are then deleted permanently.
All your other data, such as your device’s service history, your purchase history and Customer Care contact data, will be deleted separately unless an applicable law requires us to retain it. Polar Customer Care will notify you when this data has been deleted.
Please note that the Polar Flow service and some of the features of your Polar product will be unavailable to you after we have deleted your account. You will not be able to synchronize your data with our service or update the firmware version of your device.
How do I review the data you have about me?
You can review your data directly in our web services at
https://flow.polar.com
or
https://account.polar.com
. To review any other information (such as your purchase history, Customer Care contact history, or service history), contact Customer Care.
How do I export my data out of Flow?
You can download your data at
https://account.polar.com
using the “Download your data” button. Please note that the export contains all of the Polar Flow data that was originally provided by you (for example, data given by you during the account registration process), and most of the data coming from the Polar devices or Polar apps you use. This export does not include any data that is derived from the data provided by you using Polar algorithms. Instead, it includes raw or pre-processed forms of data.
This data download functionality is not a mass loader for exercises even though all of your exercises are included. To download complete exercises, you need to log in to Flow and export your training sessions from there. For instructions, visit
https://support.polar.com/en/support/how_do_i_export_individual_training_sessions_from_polar_flow_web_service
.
If I request that my data is removed from Polar’s services, can you guarantee that it is removed from all places where it has been transferred from Polar’s services, including systems belonging to third parties?
Polar has detailed processes for deleting data in order to ensure that the data is deleted from all places where it may be stored. However, Polar does not have access to systems belonging to third parties where you yourself have shared your data (e.g. Strava), so you will have to contact them yourself to request that the data is removed.
How do you identify me when I contact Customer Care?
Polar’s main method for identifying user is the email address linked to the account. We don’t need to know your real identity; we just need to know that you are the one controlling the email address linked to the account. If you contact Polar Customer Care using the contact forms at Polar.com, we will also send a message to the email address linked to your account to make sure that the person asking for assistance is the person managing the account/email. If you send Customer Care a message using another email address than the one linked to your account, we will again send the confirmation message to the email linked to the account before accessing any of your data.
In some situations, we may need to do some further checking if there is a problem with the linked email. In those cases, we will ask information about the account that only person using that account can know and proceed only if we are absolutely sure that the person is who they claim to be.
You can change the linked email address to your account whenever you want at
https://account.polar.com
. You can do this in situations where you, for example, no longer have access to the original email. You just need to know the password to your Polar account. If you ask Customer Care to change your email address and you don’t know the password to the account, it is possible that Customer Care cannot identify you based on the information you give. In those cases, you will lose the account data.
I had a Polarpersonaltrainer.com account, but I can't find the service or my data. What happened?
The polarpersonaltrainer.com service was ramped down on 31 Dec 2019. All active users were sent several notifications about what was going to happen, recommending users to transfer their data to the Flow service. If you didn't transfer your data in time, unfortunately it is now deleted and cannot be restored.
Can you confirm that you do not sell my data, or have you ever sold my data to a third party?
Rest assured that we never have and never will sell any of our customer data to a third party.
Does Polar collect data about me and what is it used for?
We use your training data to offer you the service you have requested. In other words, to give you the training results and e.g. show you how active you are during the day. We don’t use it for anything else and we don’t look at individual customer data without a request from the user.
We may use anonymous data for statistics and pseudonymous data for research and development. The research and development use is purely to improve our services so that we can make our algorithms even more precise or develop new features. All that work cannot be done without data.
I would like to exercise my right to object to the handling of my personal information for research and development purposes. How do I do that?
You can object to handling of your data for research and development purposes by opting out from it at Polar Flow or account.polar.com services. You can also send a request to our
Customer Care
.
Please remember that the data we use for research and development purposes is pseudonymized and your personal identifiers are not used.
I would like to refuse automated decision making/to request handling personal information to be restricted. How do I do that?
This right is not absolute and can be exercised if these processes cause legal effects or significantly affect you. Polar doesn’t do the kind of automated decision making that would cause you any significant effects.
If you wish to restrict the handling of your personal data, please send a valid reason for it to our Customer Care.
I would like to exercise my right to refuse profiling. How do I do that?
This right is not absolute and can be used if these processes cause legal effects or significantly affect you. Polar does not do that type of profiling and therefore we cannot comply with requests such as this.
According to GDPR, the type of profiling that you as the data subject have right to object to is:
"The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her."
The profiling that Polar does is completely different. We primarily use data masses for research purposes. For marketing purposes, we may use the data for finding groups of customers with similar goals or fitness interests (etc.) to send them articles they might find interesting if they have given their consent for marketing messages. So there are no legal effects or similarly significant effects to our customers' lives in this type of profiling.
We have the "right to refuse profiling and automated decision-making" listed with other rights in our privacy statement because we want our customers to know their rights listed in the law. So you have the right to object and if we did the kind of profiling the law refers to we would stop it.
How will the invalidation of EU U.S. Privacy Shield affect data transfer out of EU/EEA?
In its July 2020 Schrems II judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) declared the European Commission’s Privacy Shield Decision invalid on account of invasive US surveillance programs, thereby making transfers of personal data on the basis of the Privacy Shield Decision illegal.
However, in July 2023 EU and U.S. agreed on a new data protection mechanism called EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Followed by a UK extension and a Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the frameworks facilitate trans-Atlantic commerce and enable transfer of personal data to organizations in the U.S. consistent with the EU, UK and Swiss laws.
What is the EU-U.S. Data Privacy framework?
The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is an agreement that facilitates cross-border transfers of personal data from the EU to U.S. Companies in the U.S. that participate in the Data Privacy Framework commit to handling personal data according to certain core privacy principles. Hence, U.S. ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data, a level that is comparable to EU's.
Where is my data stored? Can you tell me where your cloud service is located?
The information in your Polar account and all of your Polar Flow exercise and activity data is saved in the Polar Flow ecosystem. The actual service data is stored on servers located in Ireland and Sweden, but in some monitoring and ancillary activities of the Polar ecosystem (for example sending automatic messages), customer email address or ID may be transferred to a service provider server outside the EU. The term “transfer” also covers remote use of data, so it is possible that your data that is stored in the EU is also handled from outside the EU. If your data is stored or handled outside the EU, protection mechanisms approved by the EU, such as the EU’s model contractual clauses, are always applied.
Is it safe to transfer data outside Europe?
If Polar transfers data outside the EU and EEA, the transfer is protected with protection mechanisms approved by the EU. These are:
Adequacy decision; The EU considers the level of security of the country in question to be adequate and is satisfied that the data can be transferred securely (
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en
)
EU’s model contractual clauses (
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en
)
The actual physical data transfer is always encrypted and conducted over a secure connection.
What kind of data is transferred outside the EU/EEA?
Training data and personal data are primarily stored on servers located in the EU, and it is monitoring data and automated messages that are stored outside of the EU. If Polar transfers data outside the EU and EEA, the transfer is always protected using protection mechanisms approved by the EU. These are:
Adequacy decision; The EU considers the level of security of the country in question to be adequate and is satisfied that the data can be transferred securely (
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en
)
EU’s model contractual clauses (
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en
)
The actual physical data transfer is always encrypted and conducted over a secure connection.
Is my data encrypted when it is stored and transferred? Do you support the Perfect Forward Secrecy protocol?
Some of the data is encrypted when it is stored, but not all. All data is encrypted when it is transferred, for example when you synchronize data from your wrist device to the Flow mobile app or through FlowSync to the Flow service. Perfect Forward Secrecy is not supported at the moment, but we are planning to support it in the future.
Which devices can see my data if I have HR visible to other devices setting enabled?
If you have
HR visible to other devices
setting enabled in your sports profile, compatible devices using Bluetooth Smart wireless technology, e.g. gym equipment, can detect your heart rate. You can also use your watch during Polar Club classes to broadcast your heart rate to the Polar Club system.
The setting is enabled by default in a number of indoor sports, group sports and team sports profiles, see list of the sports profiles at:
https://support.polar.com/en/polar-flow-sport-profiles
.
You can enable or disable Bluetooth broadcasting from
sport profile settings
.
Does Polar track my location?
Polar does not track your location. Location data is, however, needed when using some of the features of Polar devices and services. For example, if you are doing a GPS-based training, then your route will be recorded within the training either through your wrist device or mobile device, depending on which tools you are using.
Your current location cannot be found out by Polar. There is no way to remotely connect to your device even if you should have the GPS on.
How is the data protected? What do you do to protect the data?
Polar protects the data by using technical, physical and administrative security measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to Polar systems. Polar uses, for example, encryption techniques, pseudonymization/anonymization, and other security technologies.
Who can process my data? Who has access to the users’ data? How many people have access to the users’ data? How is the data shared with third parties?
Only persons who need to process user data in their work (e.g. Customer Care) have access to user data. Our personnel is regularly trained in data protection and in processing customer data securely. We have strict policies and work instructions for handling customer data. All access to data is also logged, so if there would be any unauthorized access (not requested by the customer) it will be seen in the logs.
Processing is legally a broad term which also covers the storage of data, access to data (directly or remotely), data transfer etc. On a large scale, user data is also processed by third parties to which we refer in our Privacy Notice. These third parties include, for example, the bodies we use to produce the Flow platform and to store data. We also use subcontractors in our planning and development work, to some extent. We have strict confidentiality agreements with them, and they rarely have access to actual user data. In other words, we only share data with third parties for maintenance, monitoring and development purposes and do not allow them access to actual user data.
Is the password of my account encrypted, and what algorithms have been used?
For security reasons, we do not disclose what encryption methods we use, but passwords are encrypted with a strong method.
What does data protection mean?
Personal data protection is a basic right that protects your privacy. Personal information includes your name, email address, telephone number and all other information through which you can directly or indirectly be identified. Data protection includes methods and processes for keeping this data safe. Data protection must always be taken into account when handling personal information.
What do different protection techniques mean?
Protection techniques refer to software and methods used to protect data. For security reasons, Polar does not specify what software is used. Protection techniques also include methods for handling data, rules concerning who can handle data, ensuring safety and reliability when cooperating with a third party etc.
If I delete a student or school from Polar GoFit, is all data really deleted? What about backups?
When a student is deleted from Polar GoFit, all data pertaining to that student is deleted and cannot be restored. If a contact teacher deletes a school account, all data is deleted, with the exception of the contact teacher email address and school account information. Our automatic deletion process will delete all school/student data six months after the license expiration date, however, Polar can delete all data sooner upon request. If Polar deletes data by request of the school, we will always send you a confirmation email once the deletion is done. If the school deletes data themselves, no separate confirmation message about the deletion is sent by Polar.
Data cannot be deleted from backups, but all data on backups will eventually be deleted in accordance with the Polar backup retention time policy.
If I as a player link my Flow account to my team’s Team Pro account, will it affect my use of Polar Flow?
Your team members will see your training sessions. What is more, the training sessions you perform in Team Pro are also shown on your personal Flow account.
Who owns the data in Polar Club, Team Pro and GoFit?
The club/team/school controls their data in these systems. Users of these systems contact the club/team/school whenever they need something done with their data (for example, amend or delete something). The club/team/school is also responsible for acquiring the necessary consents for e.g. collecting data. Polar acts only as a processor and service provider while the club/team/school owns the data in the system. Also, the user of these systems has ownership to their data. In Club, if a user uses a Flow account to sign for a class, all data is saved to the Flow system where the user is the owner of the data and no data is saved in the Club system. In Team Pro, the Team usually owns all data, depending on the team/player contract.
Who can access the data in Polar Club, Team Pro and GoFit?
Only the club/team/school admin users can see the data in the system if there is any data to see. Polar will not access the data unless there is a written request from the club/team/school admin user.
For how long will the data be retained in Polar Club, Team Pro and GoFit?
The data is retained for as long as there is a valid license. When the license is expired or the term is ended for some other reason, the data is retained for additional 6 months before it will be deleted. The customer can request in writing for the data to be deleted sooner, and once that is done, a notification is sent to the admin user. In some Polar B2B services, customers can also delete most of the data themselves.
