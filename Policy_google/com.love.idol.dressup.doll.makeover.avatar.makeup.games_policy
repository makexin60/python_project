1. Information We Collect from You
We collect most of the information about you directly when you play our games or interact with third-party ads within our games or ads for other publishers' games. Generally, the information we collect pertains to the type of device you use, identifiers that help us recognize your device, how you play our games, and may include information you voluntarily provide when contacting us. We may also collect information from app store platforms, partners, and other third parties, such as details about your interests and in-app purchases (note that we never receive your payment or credit card information).
The information we collect about you through our Services falls into the following categories:
(a) Information You Voluntarily Provide
Certain parts of our Services may ask you to voluntarily provide personal information. For example, we may request certain details to process your inquiries, such as:
•	Your name, email address, or other details to address your queries.
•	Any information you submit to our support team via email.
The personal information we ask you to provide and the reasons for requesting such information will be explained at the point of collection.
(b) Information We Collect Automatically
When you use our Services, we may automatically collect certain information from you and/or your device, which may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws. This information includes:
•	Data and analytics regarding your use of our Services (e.g., in-game progress, levels completed, games played, session duration, preferences, in-game ads you may have viewed, referrals, or gaming preferences).
•	Your IP address and device identifiers, such as your Advertising ID or Device ID (for more details, see Advertising ID and Device ID below).
•	The type of device you use and its operating system.
•	Communications within the Services (e.g., in-game emoji signals exchanged with other players).
•	Broad geographic location based on your IP address (e.g., country or city-level location).
•	Precise geolocation information, where applicable. Please note that precise geolocation data is considered sensitive information. Declining to provide such data will only restrict specific features but will not affect your overall ability to use our Services. You can revoke access to geolocation information at any time.
•	Crash logs generated automatically when the program crashes. We may collect these logs and analyze them using specialized tools to identify the cause of the crash.
•	Diagnostic data collected during troubleshooting (e.g., system status, app information, and device performance) to identify the root cause of an issue and implement solutions.
•	Permission to access external storage, such as files and photos, required for certain features. However, we do not collect or use music files, audio files, videos, voice recordings, or similar data.
Advertising IDs
refer to Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) and Google’s Advertising ID (GAID). These are unique identifiers used for personalized advertising and are consistent across mobile apps, allowing cross-app tracking. On Apple devices, you can opt-out by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Android devices, you can opt-out by choosing “Opt-out of Personalized Ads.” Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers that are unique to your device.
Device Identifiers/Information
include details such as the device type, model, manufacturer, operating system, language, screen size, or processor, or a combination of such technical data. These identifiers help developers assess device compatibility with specific apps.
Some of this information may be collected via cookies, as explained further under the
Cookies
section.
(c) Information We Obtain from Third-Party Sources
•	Third-Party Social Networks:
Google Play Games Services, Apple Game Center, Facebook (“Third-Party Social Networks”). You may choose to connect to our Services through your social media account.

(See also Third-Party Social Networks below.)
•	Third-Party Service Providers:
We may obtain your personal information from third-party sources. For instance, if you install our game after clicking on an advertisement for the same game, we may receive certain personal information related to your activity.
•	Advertising Partners:
Occasionally, we may also obtain your personal information from other third-party sources. For example, if you click an advertisement that leads you to one of our Services (e.g., an ad for one of our games displayed in another publisher's game), we will receive information about which ad network and ad campaign led to the installation. (See also Advertising below.)
(d) No Collection of Special Categories of Information
We do not request or intend to collect any "special categories of information," such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data used to uniquely identify a natural person, health-related data, or data concerning a natural person’s sexual orientation or sexual activity. Please exercise caution when sharing such information about yourself (or others) in our forums or other communication channels.

3. How We Share Your Information
We may not be able to independently provide all the services required for the successful operation of our games. Therefore, we must share the collected information with third parties for purposes such as developing and providing our services, displaying advertisements, conducting analytics and research, and measuring the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and those of our partners.
We also reserve the right to disclose your information, including personally identifiable information, as required by law or in anonymized and aggregated forms, meaning you cannot be personally identified from the information. The following parties may receive such information:
•	Analytics Providers
We use third-party analytics providers to deliver services, perform analyses, and conduct research. The device data shared with these providers is encoded. Providers may assign a random ID to the data, ensuring it cannot be linked back to you. Aggregated data may also be used for benchmarking purposes.
•	Cloud Service Providers
Information we collect from you is stored on servers provided by third-party cloud service providers, such as iCloud or Google Cloud Platform.
•	Tracking and Anti-Fraud Providers
For certain games, we use tracking and anti-fraud providers to measure performance, optimize advertising campaigns, display ads, conduct analytics to improve our services, and prevent fraud. These providers may utilize APIs and SDKs within our games to collect and analyze data related to users and devices, such as impressions, clicks, installations, or other ad campaign performance metrics and post-install in-app events.
•	Third-Party Advertising Partners
We work with certain third-party advertising networks that assist us in serving ads to you, enabling us to provide games for free or at a low cost.
•	Third-Party Trackers for Advertising Partners
We permit our advertising partners to track impressions, clicks, installations, or other ad campaign performance metrics via their tracking providers. These partners may use their own third-party tracking providers.
•	Other Third-Party Service Providers
For our games, we use Unity software for development purposes. For information on Unity's data processing practices, please refer to the Unity Privacy Policy available in their privacy center. For certain games, we collaborate with third-party development studios. These studios do not have access to your personal information; they only have access to aggregated data that cannot be traced back to you.
In the future, we may contract with additional partners or modify our existing partnerships to support game-related services. These changes will be updated periodically or promptly in the event of significant changes to our data processing practices.

We reserve the right to disclose your information, including personally identifiable information, as required by law, legal processes, litigation, and/or public and government authorities within or outside your country of residence.

4. Advertisements
(a) General
We use advertisements to fund our services and offer our games for free. Our games are available for free or at a low cost, and to achieve this, we need to share the information we collect from you with our third-party advertising partners. As a safeguard to protect your privacy, we store personal information temporarily. The collected information helps us improve our website and games while allowing players to enjoy our games for free.
If you are a user from the European Economic Area (EEA), please note:
•	When you use our game, we rely on our legitimate interest to show you advertisements. The legal basis for showing advertisements to EEA users is our legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, which has been evaluated with our Data Protection Officer. Additionally, in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR, we have signed data processing agreements with external advertising technology providers. We also ensure that our external service providers commit to high levels of data protection through data protection agreements.
•	Before sharing any information with our advertising partners for personalized ads, we always seek your consent. When you click "Accept" on the relevant button while the game loads, we seek your consent. Personalized ads will only be shown to you once you click "Accept" in the pop-up window, agreeing to share your personal information for personalized advertising purposes. Our advertising partners use various technologies to serve personalized ads and process your personal information in different ways. Therefore, before consenting to personalized ads when the game loads, please review their data processing practices. You can view our current list of advertising partners and their privacy policy links. The legal basis for showing personalized ads to EEA users is the consent obtained under Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR. Furthermore, as required by Article 28 of the GDPR, we have signed data processing agreements with external advertising technology providers. We also ensure that our external service providers commit to high levels of data protection. The goal is to improve our games and provide players with more relevant advertisements. You can withdraw your consent at any time to stop sharing your personal information for personalized advertising. You can do this by going to the game settings and clicking on the "Terms and Privacy" button. In the "Withdraw Personalized Ads Consent" section of the privacy policy, you can manage your preferences by choosing which types of ads you wish to receive. When you decide to withdraw your consent or not provide consent, you may still see the same number of ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they will not be based on your preferences, interests, behavior, demographics, etc. Our advertising partners may still show you ads based on the content of the app you are using.
(b) In-game Ads (i.e., when you view ads within our games)
To display in-game ads, we may send your Ad ID and IP address to advertisers (or ad networks) to help them find suitable ads for our games and third-party assets. You can control and limit the use of your Ad ID in your device settings. We cannot control which specific ads appear in our games (this is controlled by the ad networks), but we blacklist certain categories of ads.
Ad networks use the Ad ID for various purposes (please refer to the privacy statements of the listed advertising partners), including:
•	Limiting the number of times you see the same ad;
•	Ensuring they interact with real users, not "bots";
•	Offering ads that may be relevant to you based on your interactions with other brands and ads using your Ad ID and general geographic region. Other brands purchase ad space through ad networks or ad exchanges to promote their products in our games. Ad networks or ad exchanges act as intermediaries between other game companies and us. They track ad clicks and potential app installations for the companies buying ads to charge them. They use the advertiser’s ID to measure ad views, clicks, and installations;
•	Tracking the games you’ve played to promote similar games. IP addresses are usually used by advertisers to approximate your geographic location, such as country, state, and sometimes city level.
(c) Viewing Our Ads on Third-Party Services
We also promote our games in other apps by requesting ad networks to target relevant audiences (identified using Ad IDs).
Ad networks use the Ad ID for various purposes (see the privacy statements of our listed advertising partners), including:
•	Measuring ad performance (viewing the aggregated number of views, clicks, and installations generated by ads shown in other publishers' games);
•	Informing players who haven't played the game for some time about new content. We provide these users' lists in the form of Ad IDs to ad networks, which then show ads about new content to these users;
•	Avoiding displaying ads in games players are currently playing. We send active player lists in the form of Ad IDs to ad networks, which then exclude these players from ads;
•	Marketing the game to a group of potential players.
(d) Who Can Show You Personalized Ads?
Please refer to the list of approved ad providers who can show you personalized ads and review their data processing practices, including the technologies they use for personalized advertising.
(e) How to Turn Off Personalized Ads
In addition to the specific tools provided to EEA users through the game, you can also use your device settings.
iOS
Open the "Settings" app on iOS, select the "Privacy" menu, and then choose the "Ads" sub-option. If you activate the "Limit Ad Tracking" option, we can only take limited actions, such as identifying unique users or combating fraud. You can reset the IDFA (by selecting "Reset Advertising ID") at any time from the same menu, which will create a new ID that will not be merged with previously collected data.
Android
Open the "Settings" app and select the "Google" menu item. Depending on your device, this option may not appear in the main menu, but you can find it using the search feature at the top of the settings menu. From there, choose the "Ads" sub-option and activate the "Opt-out of Ads Personalization" option to prevent the creation of profiles and display personalized ads. You can also reset the Ad ID (by selecting "Reset Advertising ID") at any time in the same menu, which will create a new ID that will not be merged with previously collected data.
5. Third-Party Social Networks
(a) Connecting to Third-Party Social Networks
Some of our games use third-party services such as Google Play Games, Apple Game Center, Facebook (“Third-Party Social Networks”). These games allow you to log into your third-party social network account by using the “Login” feature in our app. You can also share the content you create within the app on third-party social networks. Please note that third-party social networks are governed by their own privacy policies, terms, and end-user agreements. We are not responsible for the sharing practices or policies of these third parties and cannot control those practices or policies.
If you have any other questions, please contact us at dudugamestudio@gmail.com.
(b) Information We May Receive When You Connect to Third-Party Social Networks
The information we have access to varies by application and is influenced by the privacy settings you have established on these third-party social networks. You can control these settings and learn more about them through the relevant third-party social network. When you use the "Login" feature, depending on your permission, third-party social network, and your preferences, we may access and store part or all of the following information: (i) basic information from your public profile, such as your nickname and profile picture; (ii) login ID and/or player identifier string; (iii) your friend list; (iv) any other information detailed in the notifications during the “Login with...” process, which will be shown to you. We may share your name and game data (e.g., actions, game progress, and scores) in the applicable app with friends or contacts from third-party social networks who have used the “Login with...” or “Connect to” feature in the same app.
The application may also ask for your permission to post on these third-party social networks on your behalf (e.g., status updates). Please remember, we will only do so with your explicit consent, and we will store your ID and full name for user identification purposes. Other information will only be stored in the application on your device to facilitate communication between the app and third-party social networks.
(c) How You Share Your Information on Third-Party Social Networks
If you engage in game-related activities through third-party social networks, such as leaderboards and multiplayer games, you will share your information (e.g., scores, rankings, and achievements) with other players and the third-party social network.
6. COOKIES
A cookie is a file that contains a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent from a website to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use certain features of our services.
7. Children’s Privacy
We take the protection of minors' personal information very seriously. If you are under 18 years old, your guardian must carefully read this Privacy Policy and agree or authorize you to agree to use our products or services in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We do not knowingly collect or seek to collect personal data from children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly allow such individuals to use our services. If you are a child, please do not send us any personal data about yourself. If we become aware that we have collected personal data about children, we will delete that data as soon as possible. If a guardian or parent believes that we may have data from children under 13, they should contact us promptly at dudugamestudio@gmail.com so we can correct this.
