This enables us to improve our advertising and the Project and Services. Users have the option to opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by adjusting the privacy settings on their Android or iOS devices and selecting the appropriate options, such as "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android).
