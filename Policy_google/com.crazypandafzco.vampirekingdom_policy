End User License Agreement
End User License Agreement
This end user license agreement establishes the conditions under which any individual is given the right to use (i.e. granted license to use) computer games which such an interested individual is invited to familiarize himself with the terms of this license agreement and accept them upon: downloading or installing such games; creating an account in such games; gaining access to such games by other means (taking into account the continuous development of information technologies).
This end user license agreement is a public contract of accession. This means that its conditions are the same and unchanged for all users who wish to receive the right to use the games covered by it, and it is only possible to enter into this agreement by unconditional acceptance of its terms.
The games covered by this license agreement are programmed in such a way that they become available to the end user only after receiving consent from him to enter into this license agreement; therefore, successfully downloading or installing the game on his electronic device (personal stationary or mobile computer, smartphone or another similar device), creating an account in the game, or otherwise gaining access to its use, the end user automatically accepts all the terms of this license agreement and agrees to abide by them.
The terms of this license agreement fully comply with applicable laws and in no way infringe upon the end user’s rights. Nevertheless, we recommend that each interested party become fully acquainted with the terms of this license agreement before entering into it. Should there be any reason for the end user to not be satisfied with the terms of this license agreement, he is advised against entering into this agreement, which implies that he will not be able to use the game.

Subject of License Agreement
Administrator provides User with access to the Game throughout the territories that altogether make up planet Earth within the limits, on the terms and with restrictions set out in this License Agreement and its Appendices to allow User to participate in the gaming process made available via the Game’s standard functions (hereinafter Game Access), as well as with access to additional Features of the Game at additional charges and under additional terms defined individually in each separate case. The license under this License Agreement is non-exclusive and does not grant User the right to enter into any sublicensing agreements.
Game Access is free of charge. Game Features are commercial (paid).
There are Features (additional services) in the Game that can be purchased for additional charges; these simplify the gaming process for User by making additional in-game items, advantages and possibilities available, making up the range of extended functions of the Game.
Features are priced in specific in-game currency (hereinafter In-Game Currency) that is not actual money in the sense that this term carries under civil law, but constitutes a body of programmed code, audio and visuals, which is, in turn, an integral component of the Game that enables User to engage with its various functions. The relation between such In-Game Currency and the money paid by User for obtaining the right to use the additional volume(s) of nominal In-Game Currency is determined by Administrator and is displayed/indicated in the in-game shop, which, in turn, does not constitute an object or location of trade in the sense that this term carries under civil law but represent one of the Game’s electronic functions.
Intellectual Property
All materials (including, without limitation, designs, texts, graphics, images, videos, facts, applications, software, music, sound and other files, as well as their combinations and configurations) are products of Administrator’s intellectual activities and are protected from unauthorized use by law. All the rights associated with the Game and its components, as well as trademarks, are property of appropriate rights holders and are governed and protected by laws, conventions and international agreements in the field of intellectual property. Under this License Agreement, User has no right to use any of the trademarks, brand names, services marks, logos and other means of individualization, as well as web domain names that belong to Administrator, unless such User has Administrator’s expressly written authorized consent to do so.
User agrees that no materials associated with the Game may be altered, copied, distributed, reproduced, republished, downloaded, damaged, presented, posted, passed on or sold in any form and by any means, either in full or in part, and may not be in any other way used unless there is Administrator’s written consent to do so. This restriction does not apply to User-generated and User-owned content, as explained below, that can indeed be lawfully published. All other types of use of rights-reserved materials, including any secondary use or reuse and replication, require Administrator’s direct written permission, to be obtained in advance. Any reproduction or distribution of any Game materials in breach of terms of this License Agreement is strictly forbidden and may result in strict civil and/or criminal action.
User agrees that he does not acquire any property rights to any of these materials by choosing to use the Game or accessing any materials available from the Game, Game’s Virtual Space and websites that belong to Administrator, or to any materials derived from the original materials.
Entering into this License Agreement can under no circumstances be regarded as transfer and/or cession of any rights associated with the Game and/or its components, including, without limitation, Game characters, from Administrator to User. Moreover, managing and developing Game characters by User cannot be regarded as User’s authorship and/or co-authorship of such Game characters by User and Administrator.
User Content
User agrees that he publishes content as part of the Game’s Virtual Space at his sole discretion by using tools and technology provided by Administrator. User understands and agrees that he cannot distribute, sell, forward, or license this content and/or the Game application in any way, in any country or in any social network or another technological environment without a directly expressed written permission by Administrator. User renders Administrator as the Game’s Virtual Space operator to act as an agent on behalf of User should any rights dispute with any third person or party arise.
Any data, text, graphics, photographs and their combinations and configurations (hereinafter User Content) uploaded to the Game’s Virtual Space are subject to unlimited use by Administrator, in full or in part, for commercial, non-commercial and/or advertising purposes.
User acknowledges and agrees that any of his personal information within such content will at all times be processed by Administrator in accordance with its Privacy Policy.
User uploads all the texts, graphics and photographs, and the person who created such User Content accepts full responsibility for the contents and nature of such texts, graphics and photographs. This means that only Users, but not Administrator, bear responsibility for any files uploaded, published, or in any other way made public by Users.
User obliges not to upload User Content that is: (i) insulting, unlawful, discrediting, libelous, threatening, misleading, inacceptable, pornographic, annoying, promoting hatred, or in any other way conflicting with or breaking the law; (ii) fraudulent or fact-twisting; (iii) not User’s property and is not protected by any current intellectual property laws, commercial secret laws, or is in any other way in breach of one’s right to private life, property rights, or any other private individual’s rights; (iv) an advertising or an offer to engage in commercial activity, offer to come into possession of money, products or services; or (v) a parody, where a parody constitutes mocking or impersonating a third person, or an intrusion into any third person’s private life.
Administrator reserves the right, without obligation, to evaluate the extent to which any given User Content is in compliance with this License Agreement, and reserves the right to remove such content at its own discretion, suspend and/or terminate this License Agreement with a particular User deemed to be using any content that is in breach of this License Agreement, current legislation or regulation, any resolution or demand by the court, or an administrative or any other regulatory government body.
Administrator may choose to check or not check uploaded and circulating User Content, but by no means guarantees accuracy, quality, or integrity of any User Content posted via Game’s Virtual Space. When using said Game’s Virtual Space, User admits and accepts that he may come across material that he may find insulting and/or reprehensible. User accepts the fact that Administrator bears no responsibility for any User Content under any circumstances, including, without limitation, errors in User Content and any damage or loss incurred as a result of re-using such User Content.
On the basis of Clause 5.5 of this License Agreement, Administrator reserves the right to remove (temporarily or for good) any User Content from Game’s Virtual Space, with or without an appropriate User notification.
Terms Of Game Access And Providing Features To User
Provision of Game Access and Features to User under this License Agreement is executed upon the condition that User familiarizes himself with and confirms his acceptance of this License Agreement and its Appendices in the order indicated by Clause 2 of this License Agreement.
User obtains Game Access within limits and under restrictions set out in this License Agreement and its Appendices.
User pays for Features in the order prescribed by this License Agreement and its Appendices.
User pays for Features by means of expending money in ways outlined on Administrator’s Website, in the Social Network store, or in the Mobile Platform store (Google Play and/or App Store). The outstanding amount to be paid is defined within the limits as set out by the chosen method of payment. Any Feature is deemed paid for from the moment Administrator receives a confirmation of payment from the system that was used to perform the transaction.
Once credit of money towards payment for Administrator’s Features is confirmed, the User Account is in turn credited with In-Game Currency of the quantity correspondent with the money paid. In-Game Currency is a standard unit that is used in the Game to attribute value to various Features and functions that are available to User in the Game. In-Game Currency does not constitute a means of payment and cannot be used outside the Game in any way. In-Game Currency can be credited to the User Account without being paid for, but as a reward for completing certain actions in the Game by such User. Actions that entail an In-Game Currency reward vary across different Games (e.g., User reaching a new level, or completing a number of specific requirements/achievements).
After the appropriate quantity of In-Game Currency has been credited to the User Account, it can be then further used exclusively inside said Game, while the Features are considered fully provided to User independent of his own decision to use or not use this In-Game Currency inside the Game to pay for any in-game functions.
User accepts and agrees that Administrator does not engage in reverse conversion of In-Game Currency (or any other in-game valuables) to money in cash or noncash form, and does not compensate and/or reimburse any User expenses, including any expenses associated with processing payment of money to Administrator, and neither does it pay out any interest on money used, since In-Game Currency constitutes an additional Game function, and purchasing it with money funds is interpreted as purchasing a license to use this function. User has no right to purchase In-Game Currency or any in-game valuables from any third person or party, as well as sell and/or pass on In-Game Currency or in-game valuables to any other User free of charge, as Administrator grants no rights to sublicense the use of such Game functions.
User accepts and agrees with the fact that In-Game Currency can only be used to obtain additional functions inside the Game, and that any funds credited to the in-game account are not subject to reimbursement under any circumstances.
Information on additional in-game functions available via the Game, which can be obtained by means of reducing the In-Game Currency total associated with the User Account, is displayed as icons/pictograms/images and/or short descriptions of such in-game functions, as well as in the form of their attributed value to be charged in In-Game Currency, should User wish to obtain them. Any additional in-game function may only become available to User if his In-Game Currency total is sufficient at the time of purchase. User accepts and agrees with the fact that Administrator has the right to amend the order of selecting in-game functions and/or providing Features.
User agrees that, to log and archive User actions and activity inside the Game, including, without limitation, those associated with obtaining in-game valuables and other in-game functions, Administrator employs exclusively the accounting system of its own or of the third party’s that executes such logging and archiving under contract with Administrator.
Any publicly available or additional (paid) functions or Features in the Game are provided by the Game Administrator strictly. Should Administrator establish that User obtains any functions and/or paid Features inside the Game from any unauthorized third party or person acting without Administrator’s consent, Administrator reserves the right to suspend, restrict and/or terminate provision of such functions and/or Features to User, as well as remove any results or effects of using such functions and/or Features in the Game and terminate the License Agreement with involved User at once.
In case of a technical error, Game failure or shutdown, or intentional actions by User resulting in said User obtaining Features without appropriate payment for them—that is, no payment, incomplete payment, or no debit from the User Account towards obtaining these services,— Administrator has a right to withhold the value of such Features de facto obtained from any future money credit transaction by User.
User personally bears all the expenses associated with transactions of payment to Administrator of any money, including any commission or additional fees. User must save all the documents that constitute proof that he had indeed paid for Features for the whole period of using the Game and, upon Administrator’s request, be able to present such documents, as well as present any specific information about the circumstances under which those payments were executed by User.
Should User breach this License Agreement in any way, she may be denied any further provision of Game access by Administrator immediately, without any prior notification, or such access may be suspended or restricted partly or in full. The list of grounds for such suspension, restriction and/or termination of provision of Game access may be found in Appendix 1 to this License Agreement.
Obtaining any Features by User does not relieve him from having to comply with this License Agreement or from being subject to any disciplinary measures outlined by this License Agreement.
Administrator accepts no responsibility for potential unlawful actions by User associated with paying for Features in the Game.
Administrator reserves the right to suspend, restrict or terminate provision of standard game functions, Features or Game’s Virtual Space to User at its sole discretion, should there arise any basis to believe that User has been engaging in unlawful activity, until the situation is clarified/resolved.
In certain cases, Administrator reserves the right to forward certain User information to legal authorities, if said User acts in breach of this License Agreement.
If User has any complaints about the content of de facto provided Features, he must immediately inform Administrator by email via the special online form at https://crazypanda.ae/en/contacts/, specifying his identification details, the instances that brought up the complaint, the time and date of the incident, and the reasons behind the complaint.
In case the Feature was not provided or was provided inappropriately and/or incompletely, User has a right to file a complaint to Administrator. No compensation under the terms of this License Agreement may exceed the In-Game Currency value of the Feature or function in dispute that was not provided or was provided inappropriately.
User acknowledges and agrees with the fact that Administrator reserves the right to amend this License Agreement and its Appendices and the list of and prices attributed to Features at its sole discretion, publicly notifying of such amendments on the Website at a permanent URL address of https://crazypanda.ae/en/eula and/or by email and/or in the Game Client no later than 5 days in advance of the said amendments coming into effect. By continuing to engage in the gaming process, User expresses his agreement with the new amended terms and conditions.
User agrees that any elements (objects) of the Game may be added, altered and/or removed from the Game at Administrator’s sole discretion at any time without seeking any User consent to do so, including incidents of expired licenses for any Game elements (objects). Moreover, Administrator reserves the right to introduce alterations to the list of and prices attributed to Features at its sole discretion and amend the order of conversion of money credited by User in exchange for In-Game Currency by publishing all the altered information inside the Game.
User agrees that the Game is subject to regular updates and upgrades that take place automatically without any prior notifications to and/or consent from User, as well as that Administrator has the right to shut down and/or restrict the Game utility at any time without any prior notifications to User.
User agrees, understands and accepts that the Game bears no relation to gambling, does not constitute a money game, a competition, or a bet, and that obtaining Features is done solely at his own discretion and is by no means a necessary or obligatory condition of playing/using the Game and/or taking part in the gaming process.
Administrator operates the Game and its gaming processes solely at its own discretion. In order to collect statistical data and identify Game visitors, Administrator may track and store information on IP addresses that Users use to access the Game, as well as use cookies (technical information files) stored on Users’ local terminals/devices that are used to access the Internet and, subsequently, the Game.
Administrator reserves the right to request, collect and store Personal User Data in accordance with data protection laws, as well as use such Data according to the Privacy Policy, which can be viewed here https://crazypanda.ae/en/privacy-policy. User accepts and agrees that Privacy Policy is included in and constitutes an inherent part of this License Agreement.
Administrator reserves the right to store and process Personal User Data after this License Agreement is terminated with the aim of confirming the fact that this License Agreement was previously entered into by User and Administrator and that Administrator has duly executed this License Agreement during its effective period.
Administrator reserves the right to involve third persons or parties (agents, contractors, etc.) in provision of Features or executing settlements and payments between Administrator and User under this License Agreement without seeking prior User consent to do so. When choosing to execute any payment for any Features in the Game, User obliges to familiarize himself with and accept the terms of specific payment systems and agent operations.
User agrees that Administration is entitled to amending server game balance at its own discretion so as to seek better conditions and enhance users’ experience.
User agrees that he will exercise caution and awareness when storing and transmitting information about his Account to any other persons. The Administrator will consider any actions performed in the Game using User’s Account as the actions of the User himself, committed by him at his own will. Any responsibility for the consequences of such actions shall be borne by User. User acknowledges and agrees that by purchasing Features, he immediately and finally acquires the right to use additional gaming opportunities, which he can use at any time at his own discretion to influence the gameplay, and which necessarily create advantages for him compared to the usual game conditions. The User agrees that he will deliberately and prudently make any purchases of the Features and shall be fully responsible for this, therefore the Administrator will consider any purchases of the Features, including those made using the User Account, a willful action of the User that meets his desires. The User acknowledges and agrees that due to the exceptionally positive effect on him of the Features purchased by him for in-game currency or real money, and the possibility to use them at any time at his own discretion, such acquisition is irreversible, that is under no circumstances will the Administrator return the spent in-game currency or real money to User.
