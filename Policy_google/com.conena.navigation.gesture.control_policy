Privacy policy for "Gesture Control", "Gesture Control - Pro Key" and "Screen Off for Gesture Control"
Already by the fact that the apps intentionally do not request permission for Internet access, it is technically impossible that data is sent to the developer or third parties.
The Pro version communicates with the Google Play app on the device to validate the license status, but not directly with the Internet. In this case, only the license is validated, but no personal data is exchanged.
Gesture Control can also send "commands" to other apps, e.g. to open web pages or execute functions in other apps. As far as personal data could be exchanged in the process, this never happens automatically and only insofar as the user has actively configured this (e.g. entering the URL of a website).
Errors or other special events are logged in the local log system of the device. If the user wants to make these log entries available to the developer, he has to send them manually by e-mail.
Other data such as settings are stored locally and are lost when the app is uninstalled, unless they have been exported to local storage beforehand.
