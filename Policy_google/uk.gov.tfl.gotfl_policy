TfL Go is a travel app created by us to help Londoners better plan easy, accessible journeys on public transport and to help customers avoid the busiest times.
In January 2025 we introduced account functionality to the app, meaning you can now use the app to login to an existing Oyster and contactless account or register for a new one.
If you access your account via TfL Go, register for a new account via the app or access your account via the website, you should also refer to the privacy notices for
Oyster
and
Contactless payment
.
Personal information we process
If you use TfL Go and have given us permission, we will access your location data (e.g. latitude and longitude) to deliver some of the app features. The location data is provided by Apple's Location Services or Google's Location Services (depending on your device's operating system). For more information visit
Apple's page on Location Services & Privacy
and
Google's page on how it uses location information
.
If you use the TfL Journey Planner in the app, we will collect the "from" and "to" location (latitude and longitude) in your searches, including your current location if planning a journey from there. We also collect any journey planning preferences you select. This could include accessibility options (e.g. 'step-free' mode, preference for escalators or stairs, etc), choice of transport, fewest changes or least walking, time of arrival or departure.
Where you have given permission, the app displays your previous search history under the 'Where to?' function. You can change your permission at any point in the app settings. You can also select an option to clear this below any search history displayed or swipe left on individual queries to clear. Your full history can also be cleared within the app settings.
If you use the 'Bus Stops Near You'
feature in this app, we will collect the latitude and longitude of your current location.
You can also request to display a widget on your device's home or lock screen, to show the status of lines. This is set by you on your device, not from within the app, and TfL do not maintain a record of widgets set on individual devices.
In August 2022 a new feature was added to TfL Go. In the 'Where to?' search feature you can see content related to 'promoted places'. This is not targeted to you as an individual, instead all app users see the same content. The content may include links to plan a journey to a given place from your current location and tell you how far away you are, but this will only work if you have allowed TfL Go to access your location. Content may al
so include links to external websites for which we hold no responsibility. You should check the relevant third-party website for more information and to access their privacy statement.
If you access your Oyster and contactless account through TfL Go, or register for a new account, you should view the
Oyster
and
contactless
privacy notices for full details of what information we process in relation to accounts and card use on the network. In summary, this is information you provide to us during the set-up and login process or once you have registered a card to the account (e.g. name, address, email address, Oyster card number, marketing and contact preferences, journey history, transaction information, etc). To display account information to you in the app, we also capture some information about your device, such as a device identifier, type and details of the operating system and version of the app you are using.
The 'Journey planning', 'Bus Stops Near You', widgets and promoted places features described above are delivered via API calls. I
n addition, the app makes other API calls when various actions are taken by you - such as searching for stations, displaying crowding information and line status updates, sharing details about our stations, etc.
An API call involves a data exchange between your device and TfL's data systems, and results in collection of data. Data collected includes details of the request (e.g. latitude, longitude and preferences noted above, where applicable) and some data about the device making the request - including the device type and provider, IP address and location (including borough and country) associated with the IP address. We collect this information to provide information to you and respond to your actions in the app and investigate issues, but all API calls must be security assessed also. TfL use tools to protect and monitor the security of our external connections (including API calls).
If you have given consent, we will use analytics (a similar technology to cookies) to capture information about your use of the app (we call this "usage data"), including:
Device type, model and Operating system
Details of accessibility settings used on a device (e.g. whether screen readers, reduced motion, or voice control, etc, is active)
Unique ID - pseudonymised from the device ID / MAC address, but providing the ability to track usage on a specific device over time
Session information - number (count of visits), duration, time/date, location (mapped to a region, for example, London Borough)
When and where accessed (this is based on IP address and is not taken from device GPS data)
Screens viewed and interaction on screens, for example, zooming and panning on the map
App interaction - including stations tapped on and stations entered into the 'to' and 'from' fields in Journey Planner, interaction with 'promoted places' (including links clicked on and journeys planned)
Account interaction - including actions taken such as top-ups, travel cards held, ticket duration, card selection, etc
Behaviour flows (journeys through the app - for example, where someone exits)
Number, type of widget (i.e. size or format) and line installed
App crashes
We do not use this usage data to identify you, but it provides us with the ability to see usage on a specific device over time.
If you email us from the feedback section in this app, we will receive and process your emails.
Legal basis for using your information
Under data protection legislation, TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. In the case of TfL Go, there are a number of these legal grounds we rely on, which are:
We process your location, preference and device data and feedback emails to perform tasks in support of our statutory functions:
- To undertake activities to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver the Mayor's Transport Strategy
- To provide you with control over the use of your location data, we ask for your permission to access your location data when the app is first launched. If you haven't given your permission, we will ask again when you try to use a feature that requires access to your location data, such as tapping a station on the map and planning a journey. You can change your permission for this app via Location Services in your device settings at any time. Some users can also control the accuracy level of location data TfL Go is allowed to use. iOS users (iOS 14 and 14+) can do so by managing their preference for Precise Location when we ask for their permission to access location data and in their device settings. Android users can do so by managing their preference for Location Accuracy (Android 9 and 9+) or Mode (Android 8) in their device settings
Where you have created an account, we process your information for the 'performance of a contract'
To verify your identity when you log on to your account and to process data for online account security monitoring purposes, we process your information for the 'purposes of legitimate interests'
Where you have opted in to receive marketing messages from us during the account registration process, we process your information based on consent. You can change this at any time by logging on to your account on our website (you currently can't change this setting in the app)
We process your usage data based on consent. We ask for your consent to share your usage data with us when the app is first launched and will review this by asking again on occasion, where appropriate. You can withdraw or change your consent in the app settings at any time
If you are under 13, we ask you to get your parents or guardians to decide whether to give us consent to process your personal data. Your use of the app is also subject to Apple or Google's rules and policies (including age requirements). If there is anything you don't understand or aren't sure about in this notice or in Apple or Google's rules and policies, talk to a trusted adult (such as your parent or guardian) and ask them to help.
Obtaining and using your information
If you allow TfL Go to access your location data, we will use it to provide you with location-based features, such as to:
Show you where you are on the Tube map
Show you where you are and walking directions on the geographic map
Make it easier for you to use the Journey Planner. For example, we will use your current location as the "from" location and you can tap on a station to get the best routes from your current location
Show you bus stops nearby. For example, you can tap on 'Bus Stops Near You' on the home screen to show a list and map of bus stops near your current location. If you tap on a bus stop, it will show you the full stop view with all buses and where you are on the geographic map.
If you choose not to allow TfL Go to access your location data, you are still able to use the app but you won't see where you are on the maps and bus stops nearby. You will also need to enter your "from" and "to" location manually when using the Journey Planner.
If you turn off Precise Location in the iOS app, turn off Location Accuracy or select Mode options other than High Accuracy in the Android app, you can still use these features but it may impact the accuracy of location data.
If you use the Journey Planner in this app, we will collect your "from" and "to" location in your searches and any preferences you submit to process your search requests.
If you use the 'Bus Stops Near You' feature in this app, we will collect the latitude and longitude of your current location.
If you give consent to share your usage data with us, we will use your usage data to help us understand how this app is used and measure its performance. For example, to find out the most useful sections, spot bugs and identify things we can improve.
During your use of the app some information is stored directly on your device to support a variety of functions. It is stored in iOS User Defaults and Android's Encrypted Shared Preferences depending what type of device you use. This includes your journey planning preferences, detail about screens shown to you and when to support the logic of displaying screens (e.g. not displaying an announcement you have already seen), your recent search history (if you have opted to save this) and your most recent location (if location sharing is enabled). Where applicable this information will be routinely updated and will be removed from your device if you delete the app.
If you email us from the feedback section in this app, we will use your email to fix problems you reported and reply to your communications. We will also use your feedback to identify areas for improvement.
In July 2021 the app was updated to provide customers with near real-time information on how busy London Underground stations are throughout the day. This uses aggregated and depersonalised data from TfL's Wi-Fi network. Please see our
Wi-Fi data collection privacy notice
to find out how and why TfL collects Wi-Fi connection data from mobile devices.
Your Oyster and contactless account
The personal information we hold is provided by you when you access or create an Oyster and contactless account via the app and register your Oyster and contactless cards to it. Accounts can be created and accessed via TfL Go, and on our website. Depending on how you set up an account and attach an Oyster or contactless card to it, we will request only necessary information from you. For example, if you create an account via the app for your Oyster card we do not require a security question and answer, or security passcode number. But if you add a contactless card we will ask for additional information. If you set up the account via our website, or access your app account via our website, this additional information is also required.
When you access your journey history via this app, it is only possible to view the last eight weeks of travel for both Oyster and contactless cards. More journey history may be available if you login to your account via the website, alongside some other account related information not available in this app.
In May 2023 we introduced
multi-factor authentication (MFA)
to strengthen the existing security measures for online accounts. We request a mobile phone number which will be used each time you sign in to receive a text with a unique code to enter in the sign in screen. The phone number provided for MFA will only be used for the purposes of MFA, unless you have previously provided the number to TfL for a separate purpose (e.g. when liaising with Customer Services).
Some account related information is stored directly on your device (including in Apple's Keychain and Android's Encrypted Shared Preferences), to support the ability to remain logged in and display information to you, including the display order of your cards and whether any are hidden. This includes your name, address, email address, Oyster and contactless cards, card nicknames and journey history. This will be routinely updated and depending on the type of information and what device you use, it will be removed if you sign out, or when the app is uninstalled or reinstalled.
Cookies in the app
Some of the specific actions you need to take in your Oyster and contactless account when accessing via the app take you to an 'in-app web view'. These actions include: create account, signing in, forgot password, claim a refund, add a contactless card. This means you leave the app temporarily and access a webpage via an in-app web browser, resulting in interaction with cookies on the website.
If using the app with an Android device, you will interact with our
cookie consent management tool
to set your cookie preferences within in-app web views. When accessing the app via an Apple device, this 'in-app web view' has been set to only drop those cookies which are essential to ensure the web pages work properly. For more information on our approach to managing cookies on TfL websites see the
cookies privacy notice
.
If you follow a link to a web page from elsewhere in the app (i.e. not via an 'in-app web view'), it will open in the web browser on your device, not within the app itself. This means you will interact directly with our cookie consent management tool.
Length of time we keep your information
We will retain personal information in line with our data retention policies. This means that we will not hold information for longer than is necessary for the purposes we obtained it for.
Your most recent location data is held in your device's memory by the app for a very short period of time for you to use location-based features.
Your usage data is kept for 3 years.
You can withdraw your consent to process this within the app settings. Once consent is withdrawn, we will no longer collect this data.
Your feedback emails are kept for 7 years.
For more details on the length of time we keep your information in relation to your Oyster and contactless cards and account, see the
Oyster
and
contactless
privacy notices.
Keeping your information secure
We take the privacy of our customers very seriously, and a range of robust policies, processes and technical measures are in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, your personal information.
This includes ensuring that your payment card data is handled in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ('PCI DSS').
Anyone with access to personal information held in TfL's systems is required to complete TfL's privacy and data protection training on an annual basis.
In 2023 we introduced multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen the existing security measures for Oyster and contactless online accounts. MFA is an additional layer of security to the account sign in process, helping to confirm you are who you say you are each time you sign into your account. You may be prompted with a subsequent MFA request in certain circumstances.
Alongside the use of MFA, account sign-ins are subject to automated fraud and security monitoring to identify suspicious activity and further protect accounts and the information within them. This includes monitoring login activity at the point of sign in and over time (e.g. IP address, browser, geographic location determined by IP address, identity information, known compromised credentials, previous login behaviour, etc).
We also publish guidance on the steps you can also take to
protect your personal information
.
Automated processing and profiling
Under data protection legislation we must let you know when we use your personal information to make an automated decision (without human intervention) that significantly affects you.
If you use an Oyster or contactless card, or access your Oyster and contactless account via the app you may be subject to automated decisions. Full details are published in the
Oyster
and
contactless
privacy notices.
We use automated processes to support the security of your account and the information within it - such as presenting MFA requests to authenticate your identity and ongoing monitoring to identify suspicious activity such as fraud.
If you have difficulties accessing your account, you can contact Customer Services for support.
Sharing of your information
We share information only in limited circumstances.
If you use the Journey Planner in this app, we will share the latitude and longitude for the "from" and "to" location in your searches, and any preferences submitted, with our Journey Planner engine provider to process your search requests, this is required for the engine to return accurate directions.
If you give consent to share your usage data with us, we will use analytics to collect your usage data to understand how the app is used and measure its performance. Your usage data will be processed on our analytics service provider's platform.
We use the Google Places API in TfL Go to provide predictions for the search terms you enter into the Journey Planner and your search terms will be passed to Google with a session token ID. The session token ID is a random string which is only linked to one complete search and is not reused if you use the same device to carry out a new search. Google collect your search terms and may use this data to provide and improve Google products and services. For more information about how Google handles your personal information, please see
Google's privacy policy
.
In some circumstances we may disclose personal information in response to valid requests from the police. Before any such disclosure takes place, the police are required to demonstrate that the personal information concerned will assist them in the prevention or detection of a specific crime, or in the apprehension or prosecution of an offender. Each request from the police is dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful and in accordance with data protection legislation.
Overseas processing
TfL and its service providers may process your personal information in the UK and countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). Any such processing will be carried out in strict accordance with UK and EU data protection legislation and the appropriate contractual safeguards which TfL has put in place.
Your information rights
Under data protection legislation you are entitled to ask to see any personal information that we hold about you.
To request access to personal information held by TfL, please see our page on how to
access your data
.
To request to delete your Oyster and contactless account you can follow instructions from within the app to submit a request.
If you would like to withdraw your consent for TfL to process your usage data or manage how TfL processes your location data, you can do so in your app settings and your device's location services settings.
If you would like to unsubscribe from TfL emails, please use the link we include at the end of every email. You can also update your contact preferences within your online account, or by emailing
unsubscribe@tfl.gov.uk
at any time.
You also have a number of other information rights which include:
The right to question any information we have about you that you think is wrong or incomplete
The right to object to how we use your information or to ask us to delete or restrict how we use it
In some cases, the right to receive a copy of your information in a format that you can easily re-use
The right to complain to the regulator - the
Information Commissioner's Office
Our Privacy and Data Protection team considers and coordinates responses to requests and complaints from people whose personal data is processed by TfL and its subsidiary companies. You can contact the Data Protection Officer by email at
dpo@tfl.gov.uk
.
Data protection impact assessments
To ensure our processing of personal data in TfL Go is appropriate, we have completed data protection impact assessments (DPIAs). We carried out a few trials of the app with employees and customers to gain feedback and a DPIA was completed for these trials ahead of the launch of the app in 2020. We also completed a new DPIA before the app was launched publicly, and when we added account functionality. Assessments follow our formal TfL governance and project management processes.

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Vendors

Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

Privacy & cookies
We are committed to protecting your personal information when you use TfL services. In this section we explain how we ensure that your privacy is respected and protected.
If you need to contact the Privacy team or submit a request, please use the relevant form on our
Access Your Data
page or email
DPO@tfl.gov.uk
. There can sometimes be delays in receiving post.
Who we are and what we do
We sometimes need to collect your personal information so that we can provide you with the full range of our services, operate London's transport network effectively and carry out our statutory functions. Here, we outline our obligations and your rights under the data protection legislation, which regulates the use of personal information by all private and public sector organisations.
TfL is a statutory body created by the Greater London Authority (GLA) Act 1999. The GLA Act gives the Mayor of London a general duty to develop and apply policies to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within London. This is known as the 'General Transport Duty'. The Mayor delegates this duty to TfL to carry out on their behalf, together with the implementation of the Mayor's Transport Strategy.
Why we handle personal information
Under data protection legislation, TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. In most cases, our handling of your personal information will be necessary for the delivery of the Mayor's Transport Strategy and the statutory functions described above.
Depending on the TfL product or service you use or sign up for, there may be another legal basis that makes the handling of your personal information lawful. You should refer to the menu of privacy pages on this page for more information.

TfL services
If you are asked to provide information when applying for, or using, specific TfL services (eg the Zip Oyster photocard or Santander Cycles schemes) these pages outline how we use and protect this information.
Service messages and marketing
If you are currently receiving service messages or marketing communications from TfL and no longer wish to do so, please let us know by emailing
unsubscribe@tfl.gov.uk
.
If you are receiving marketing emails as a business contact, we rely on the 'legitimate interests' processing condition to contact you based on our previous engagement, or consent if you have signed up via our registration form. If you would like to unsubscribe from these messages, please email
CommercialMediaandPartnerships@tfl.gov.uk
.
Please note on some occasions there are some service messages that we are obliged to send, regardless of your contact preferences. For example, these include emails regarding purchases or other financial transactions you've made and important account updates where you have created an online account or downloaded an app.
Sharing personal information
We do not sell your personal information to anyone. We don't share your personal information with any third parties unless they are providing services to us under contract or disclosure is permitted by, or required by, law. Please refer to the menu of privacy pages on this page for more information.
Third-party sites
Our website contains links to sites owned and operated by third parties. They have their own privacy policies, and we urge you to review them before browsing those sites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third-party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.
Protecting your personal information
Your privacy is very important to TfL, and we take all necessary measures to ensure your personal information is properly protected and secured. This includes having appropriate technical and organisational arrangements to secure your information. TfL will never send an unsolicited message asking you to provide your password, financial details or other sensitive information by email or through a link.
Current and recent projects
Google Street View
TfL worked with Google to deliver Street View in Stations, which launched in December 2024. This provides TfL customers with additional journey planning support. More detail on this work, and its launch in Street View, can be found in the latest
press release
.
From November 2023 until September 2024, Google filmed at over thirty TfL stations. TfL customers were informed in advance, and on the day of filming, that filming would be taking place. During filming, images of TfL customers were captured by Google cameras as they photographed each station. Google used its blurring technology on the imagery, which is designed to automatically blur identifiable faces before publication of images on Google's Street View. Google has a process where additional blurring can be requested by users, or members of the public.
Google is the data controller and is therefore responsible for the collection of the images when filming, and the blurring of identifiable faces before footage is made public. However, our decision to allow Google to film on the network was subject to a data protection impact assessment.
Google Street View Data Protection Impact Assessment

The TfL Privacy and Data Protection team considers and coordinates responses to requests and complaints from people whose personal data is processed by TfL and its subsidiary companies. If you have any requests and complaints relating to the footage that Google collected during their filming please contact Google directly. For more information visit

E-scooter trial
TfL are currently working with London Councils and some London boroughs to deliver a rental e-scooter trial for London. The trial began on 7 June 2021 and was originally set to run for at least 12 months, with three e-scooter operators taking part. The trial has subsequently been extended and will now run until May 2026, with two e-scooter operators taking part. More details can be found on the
Electric scooter rental trial
.
Operators are sharing data with us throughout the trial period. This includes data relating to the location of vehicles, trips taken, user and usage information (including surveys), safety and incident reporting, environment and sustainability metrics, and education and outreach activities. Information shared with us is used to ensure we can safely manage the trial, and support research, monitoring and evaluation.
Some of the data shared with TfL will have originally been provided by e-scooter hirers during their use of an operator's services and when responding to surveys. To ensure our approach to the collection of this data is appropriate we have carried out privacy assessments and have taken steps to ensure any personal information collected is limited, for example ensuring data is aggregated and depersonalised where possible. TfL will not use any data shared with us to identify specific individuals.
Data collected will also be shared with London Councils and London boroughs, and TfL has a contract with a third-party service provider for the delivery of a data platform to store some of the data.
Under privacy and data protection legislation TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. Our 'legal basis' here is our statutory and public functions to undertake activities to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver the Mayor's Transport Strategy.
Data collected will not be held for longer than is necessary for the purposes we have obtained it for.
The TfL Privacy and Data Protection team considers and coordinate responses to requests and complaints from anyone whose personal data is processed by TfL. You can contact the Data Protection Officer by email at

Location Services allows Apple and third-party apps and websites to gather and use information based on the current location of your iPhone or Apple Watch to provide a variety of location-based services. For example, an app might use your location data and location search query to help you find nearby coffee shops or theaters, or your device may set its time zone automatically based on your current location.
To use features such as these, you must enable Location Services on your iPhone and give your permission to each app or website before it can receive location data from Location Services. Apps may request limited access to your location data (only when you are using the app or approximate location) or full access (even when you are not using the app or precise location).
For safety purposes, however, your iPhone’s location information may be used when an emergency call is placed to aid response efforts regardless of whether you enable Location Services.
Location Services uses device sensors, including GPS and Bluetooth (where those are available), along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations to determine your device’s location.
Your Apple Watch may use the location of your paired iPhone if it is nearby.
If Location Services is on, your iPhone will periodically send the geo-tagged locations of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers (where supported by a device) in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to be used for augmenting this crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations.
By enabling Location Services, location-based system services such as these will also be enabled:
Routing and Traffic: While you are in transit (for example, walking or driving), your iPhone will periodically send GPS data, travel speed and direction, and barometric pressure information in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to be used for augmenting crowd-sourced road traffic, roadway, pedestrian walkway, and atmospheric correction databases. Additionally, when you open an app near a point of interest (for example, a business or park) your iPhone will send location data in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple which Apple may aggregate and use to let users know if that point of interest is open and how busy it is.
Significant Locations: Your iPhone and iCloud-connected devices will keep track of places you have recently been, as well as how often and when you visited them, in order to learn places that are significant to you. This data is end-to-end encrypted and cannot be read by Apple. It is used to provide you with personalized services, such as predictive traffic routing, and to build better Memories in Photos.
Suggestions & Search: The location of your iPhone will be sent to Apple to provide more relevant recommendations. If you turn off Location Services for location-based suggestions, your precise location will not be sent to Apple. To deliver relevant search suggestions and news, Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.
Alerts & Shortcuts Automations: Your iPhone and Apple Watch will use your location in order to provide you with geographically relevant alerts, such as a reminder to call someone when you get to a specific place, when to leave for your next appointment, or an app or shortcut recommendation based on where you currently are.
Share My Location: You can choose to share your current location with others, on a temporary or ongoing basis, from within certain apps such as Messages and Find My.
HomeKit: Your iPhone will use your location to control accessories when you arrive at or leave a specific location, such as turning on your lights when you get home.
System Customization: Your iPhone will customize system appearance, behaviors, and settings using your current location, for example by automatically enabling Optimized Battery Charging when you are at home. This customization data does not leave your device.
Apple Pay Merchant Identification: Your iPhone will use your current location to help provide more accurate merchant names when you use your physical Apple Card.
Emergency Calls & SOS: When an emergency call is placed, in addition to location already provided to emergency services, your iPhone or Apple Watch will make supplementary data available through the Enhanced Emergency Data service. This may include street address information if your current location is near the Home or Work address in your personal contact card (My Card). If you have not uninstalled the Messages app, triggering Emergency SOS will also send location to your emergency contacts at the end of the call.
The crowd-sourced location data gathered by Apple does not personally identify you.
By enabling Location Services for your devices, you agree and consent to the transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of your location data and location search queries by Apple and its partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based and road traffic-based products and services.
You can disable Location Services at any time. To do so, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services, and either tap to turn off global Location Services or turn off the individual location switch of each location-aware app or feature by setting it to Never. To disable Location Services for all websites, set the Location Services setting for Safari Websites to Never. You can also disable location-based System Services by tapping System Services, then tapping to turn off each location-based System Service. Apps or websites may still use other information, such as the IP address of your internet connection, to attempt to approximate your location, regardless of the state of the Location Services switch.
If you allow third-party apps or websites to use your current location, you are subject to their terms and privacy policy and practices. You should review the terms, privacy policies, and practices of such apps and websites to understand how they use your location and other information.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at
www.apple.com/privacy
.

Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

Wi-Fi connection data collection began in London Underground stations on 8 July 2019 and in some Elizabeth line stations on 24 May 2022.
Wi-Fi connection data can provide us with a far better understanding of how customers move through stations. It is not used to identify specific individuals or monitor browsing activity.
TfL has partnered with Virgin Media to bring free Wi-Fi access to 97% of London Underground stations, and some Elizabeth line stations, giving customers internet access.
Find out more about station Wi-Fi
.
As well as London Underground stations, we also
collect Wi-Fi connection data in the following tube stations where Elizabeth line trains stop: Paddington, Bond Street, Tottenham Court Road, Farringdon, Liverpool Street, Whitechapel, Stratford and Ealing Broadway. We also collect
Wi-Fi connection data
from the following Elizabeth line stations that aren't served by London Underground: Canary Wharf, Custom House (not DLR platforms) and Woolwich.
Signs have been put up at stations explaining the Wi-Fi data collection that is taking place and how to opt-out.
In summary, we are collecting the location of devices on our network, identifying them by a pseudonymised version of their MAC address.
We are trying to understand patterns of movement across our network and how customers as a whole use it, not how specific individuals use it.
We are not collecting data on browsing activity, cookies, phone numbers or whether the Wi-Fi service is used.
However, if you would like to opt-out, you can do this by turning off Wi-Fi on your device, turning your device off or putting your device into airplane mode while at our stations.
What Wi-Fi connection data is
When a device such as a smartphone or tablet has Wi-Fi enabled, the device will continually search for a Wi-Fi network to connect to. When searching for a Wi-Fi network, the device sends out a probing request which contains an identifying number specific to that device known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address. This is what we mean by 'Wi-Fi connection data'.
How we collect it
If the device finds a Wi-Fi network that is known to the device, it will automatically connect to that network. If the device finds unknown networks, it will list these in your device settings so you can decide whether to connect to one of them.
When you are near one of our station Wi-Fi access points (installed on TfL privately-owned property) and you have Wi-Fi enabled, your device will send a probing request to connect. This will be received by our Wi-Fi network, even if your device does not subsequently connect.
This data collection is carried out independently by TfL, not via Virgin Media.
How we make sure we can't identify people
We will not be able to identify any individuals from the data collected. We have designed the process to identify patterns and to avoid identifying individuals. We are trying to understand how customers as a whole use the network, not how specific individuals use it.
All data collected is automatically depersonalised, using a one-way pseudonymisation process to ensure TfL is unable to identify any individual. This happens immediately after the data is first collected.
TfL has no plans to match the Wi-Fi connection data to any other data held about individuals (eg Oyster and Contactless data). There is no way to systematically do this if we wanted to.
Pseudonymisation is the process of distinguishing individuals in a dataset by using a unique identifier that does not reveal their 'real world' identity. This is a way of protecting people's privacy in accordance with the
Information Commissioner's Anonymisation Code of Practice
.
How we process it and how to prevent processing
Un-authenticated devices
If your device has not signed up to use the free Wi-Fi provided on the London Underground network and the Elizabeth line stations noted above, it's an 'un-authenticated device'.
When your device sends a probing request, it will contain a MAC address. Most modern devices send out a randomly generated MAC address to prevent unknown routers identifying the device.
We immediately remove MAC addresses associated with un-authenticated devices from any probing requests received. This data therefore contains no unique identifier and is anonymous. We will also not process these probing requests for the purposes described below.
Preventing processing
If you would like to stop your device from sending out probing requests, you can turn off Wi-Fi on your device, turn your device off or put the device into airplane mode while at our stations. You also have the right to object to this processing - see the 'Your information rights' section for further information.
Authenticated devices
If the device has been signed up for free Wi-Fi on the London Underground network and the Elizabeth line stations noted above, the device will disclose its genuine MAC address. This is known as an authenticated device.
The following processing only relates to authenticated devices.
We process authenticated device MAC address connections (along with the date and time the device authenticated with the Wi-Fi network and the location of each router the device connected to). This helps us to better understand how customers move through and between stations - we look at how long it took for a device to travel between stations, the routes the device took and waiting times at busy periods.
As a customer enters a station (if their device has Wi-Fi enabled), the device will attempt to connect to the Wi-Fi network. This is recorded in our Wi-Fi data control system. We carry out a process of hashing once a MAC address is collected. Hashing is the process of generating a new value from a string of text (in this instance the MAC address).
We carry out two rounds of hashing to make sure we never hold the original MAC address. One hash is with a single value (pepper), and the second is with another unique random value (salt) for each MAC address. This pseudonymisation process provides continuity to the data without needing to record the MAC address which could identify an individual device. This means that we have to preserve our hashing key to maintain continuity of the pseudonymised data.
We do not collect any other data generated by your device. This includes web browsing data and data from website cookies.
Preventing processing
You can turn off Wi-Fi on your device, turn your device off or put the device into airplane mode while at our stations. You also have the right to object to this processing - see the 'Your information rights' section for further information.
Why TfL is doing this
In 2016, TfL carried out a pilot collection of depersonalised Wi-Fi connection data from devices using the station Wi-Fi at 54 Tube stations in central London. We found that:
Wi-Fi data can help to understand the paths people take in stations, the platforms and lines they use, the routes they take when they have many options and the interchanges they make
Aggregated data can show which sections of the network are crowded, at what times and how this changes in response to events and network alterations
Data can be used with analytical tools and services to improve the way we run and plan our network, and provide customers with more detailed information
Find out more about the pilot and our findings
.
We want to use technology to provide better information to our customers. Wi-Fi connection data can give us a better understanding of crowding, collective travel patterns and changes over time to understand how regular and less regular customers use our stations. From this, we can improve services and information for customers.
We are able to give customers better information to help them plan their journeys and avoid congestion. For example, we use aggregated Wi-Fi connection data to show the relative 'busy-ness' of London Underground stations, in near real time. We make this available on our website and in the TfL Go mobile app
We are able to manage disruptions and events more effectively, deploy staff to best meet customer needs and ensure a safe environment
We are able to make better transport planning decisions - for example about timetables, station designs and major station upgrades
By understanding how many customers we have and how they move around stations (eg the total number of unique devices passing through a zone of a station) we are able to maximise revenue from the companies which advertise on our poster sites and digital advertising screens and those who rent retail units on our property. This money can be invested in improving our services
Oyster and Contactless Payment Card ticketing data helps us understand where customers enter and exit the network (as well as any intermediate validations). But it does not tell us the platforms and lines they are using, the stations they interchange at or how they navigate around our stations. The nature of the network means that people can take many different options for their journeys.
TfL has previously used paper surveys - but these are expensive, only provide a snapshot of travel patterns on the day of survey and are unable to provide a continuous flow of information. Depersonalised Wi-Fi connection data provides more accurate real time information for improving our services.
Benefits already provided
Using aggregate Wi-Fi connection data, we have gained further understanding of patterns of movements across the network - not how specific individuals travel, but customers as a whole.  We have identified the approximate time it takes to move through our stations and board trains at different times of the day
Aggregated and depersonalised Wi-Fi connection data has been used to understand how busy London Underground stations are throughout the day. This data has been added to the TfL Go app (and on our website) to provide customers with near real-time information on how busy specific Tube stations are at any point of the day. Please see our
TfL Go privacy page
for more information on the TfL Go app. This crowding data has been made available via our
open data feed
Aggregate footfall information of how people move across the network can also help to improve our advertising business. It helps us to position and sell possible locations for future advertising opportunities and ensure we efficiently use our existing advertising assets. This means we can raise additional revenue to reinvest in the transport network. To do this, TfL shares aggregate data with our advertising partner, Global. Data shared with Global consists only of estimated numbers of people (eg walking past an advert at different times of the day), never of data related to individual journeys
Legal basis for using this information
Under privacy and data protection legislation, TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. In the case of Wi-Fi connection data, our 'legal ground' for processing this data is:
Our statutory and public functions
to undertake activities to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver the Mayor's Transport Strategy
Data protection impact assessments
To ensure our approach to the collection of Wi-Fi connection data is appropriate, we completed two data protection impact assessments. We carried out an assessment for the pilot and a new assessment before we began collecting depersonalised Wi-Fi data from all stations with free Wi-Fi. Both assessments followed our formal TfL governance and project management processes. We will continue to keep the latest data protection impact assessment under review, preparing revised versions where necessary.

PDF 328KB
Length of time we keep Wi-Fi connection data
TfL will retain any data collected in line with our data retention policies. This means that we will not hold information for longer than is necessary for the purposes we obtained it for. Depersonalised Wi-Fi connection data will be held for two years. When this retention period is over, only aggregated data will be held. Aggregation enables us to understand patterns and movements over time and ensures that individual depersonalised data does not need to be held for more than two years.
Keeping information secure
We take the privacy of our customers very seriously. A range of policies, processes and technical measures are in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, Wi-Fi connection data. Anyone with access to this data must complete TfL's privacy and data protection training every year.
Each MAC address is automatically depersonalised (pseudonymised) and encrypted to prevent the identification of the original MAC address and associated device. At no time does TfL store a device's original MAC address.
The data collected is stored in a restricted area of a secure location. All access is governed through industry standard authentication methods. Access is limited to a restricted group of users - ie only those whose access to the data is necessary for their role.
Our encryption keys are held securely in an industry standard computer program for secrets and key management , and we use an industry standard one-way hashing algorithm. All data is encrypted at rest and when in transit.
We also publish guidance on
steps you can take to protect your personal information
.
Sharing information
Individual depersonalised device Wi-Fi connection data is accessible only to a controlled group of TfL employees. Aggregated data developed by combining depersonalised data from many devices may be shared with other TfL departments and external bodies. Aggregated data will include counts of numbers of devices, rather than data containing pseudonymised MAC addresses.
We understand that there may be scenarios where the data could be useful to the police and other law enforcement bodies. As with current processes for other data held, when we get a request to disclose data, we require the police to demonstrate that the data concerned will help them to prevent or detect crime and/or prosecute offenders.
Requests will be dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis to ensure that any disclosure is lawful. We would only be able to disclose pseudonymised data, as we do not hold the original MAC address.
Some TfL services operate at Network Rail stations alongside various other Train Operating Companies' services. We do not share any Wi-Fi connection data with Network Rail or any Train Operating Companies.
Your information rights
Please also refer to the guidance above on how to choose not to provide your device's Wi-Fi connection data. If you would like to raise an objection to this processing, contact the Data Protection Officer by email at
dpo@tfl.gov.uk
.
In order to realise some of the benefits of collecting this data, it is important that patterns of travel are understood over time. This means that we have to preserve our hashing key to maintain continuity of the pseudonymised data. It would therefore technically be possible to align the same MAC address to the same pseudonym. However, the only way TfL can determine a specific pseudonym is for the MAC address to be provided to us, as we do not retain the MAC address itself.
The rights under Articles 15 to 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) do not apply if TfL is not in a position to identify a specific individual, unless the individual provides additional information to enable identification. Only providing a MAC address does not establish a definite link between that individual and the pseudonymised journey information.
Even if we could associate a particular journey with a pseudonymised MAC address, we cannot assume the same individual was in possession of the same device on all other journeys. It would not be practical or proportionate to establish who was carrying the phone at each point in time.
This means that we are unable to provide data in response to any requests to access the Wi-Fi data generated by your device.
The TfL Privacy and Data Protection team consider and coordinate responses to any requests that relate to an individual's rights under the GDPR and complaints from people whose personal data is processed by TfL and its subsidiary companies. You can contact the Data Protection Officer by email at
dpo@tfl.gov.uk

We and our 918 advertising partners process your personal data using technology such as cookies in order to serve advertising, analyse our traffic and deliver customised experiences for you. You have a choice in who uses your data and for what purposes.
Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest. View our list of partners to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.
The Consent Signal (TC String) is stored in the Local Storage with a maximum retention period of 13 months, after which a renewed consent decision is required. Find out more about how your personal data is processed and set your preferences below.
You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Vendors
528
Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Vendors

Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

What cookies are
When we provide services to you online, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device (eg computer, tablet or mobile phone). These include small files known as cookies, and other similar technologies (such as web beacons, local storage and digital fingerprinting). These all have a very similar function of understanding people's behaviour while using websites and mobile applications. They can sometimes be used to provide information about your device or its approximate location through the unique IP address associated with it.
We will refer to these cookies and similar technologies as “cookies” for the rest of this notice.
Cookies are used to improve services for you by, for example:
Enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
Recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
Remembering your previously searched journeys on our journey planner so you can complete the same search quicker and easier
Storing bus routes, roads and tube lines that you have chosen to add to your favourites on your device so the TfL website will be personalised on your device when you next return
Measuring how many people are using our online services, so they can be made easier to use and check there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast
Analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with our site so we can make it better
Cookies can also be used to show you adverts relevant to you and your interests. There is more detail below on how advertising cookies work on TfL websites.

Your cookie settings currently apply to the following domains: account.tfl.gov.uk, accounts.tfl.gov.uk, art.tfl.gov.uk, blog.tfl.gov.uk, buskers.tfl.gov.uk, charities.tfl.gov.uk, chat.tfl.gov.uk, contactless.tfl.gov.uk, cycle-skillsonline.tfl.gov.uk, lettings.tfl.gov.uk, londonblog.tfl.gov.uk, lrsbookings.tfl.gov.uk, madeby.tfl.gov.uk, notlostenquiry.com/tfl, oyster.tfl.gov.uk, photocard.tfl.gov.uk, placesforlondon.co.uk, santander.tfl.gov.uk, schoolparty.tfl.gov.uk, stars.tfl.gov.uk, streetcare.tfl.gov.uk, techforum.tfl.gov.uk, tfl.on.icomera.com, tfl.gov.uk.

Cookie declaration last updated on 3/3/25 by
Cookiebot
:
From May 2019, TfL has been implementing a cookie consent management tool across our websites. We are using a third party software solution, called Cookiebot. This tool allows you to set your cookie settings and amend them whenever you wish. Due to the number of different services offered across all our website domains, it will take some time for your cookie settings to be applied to all the cookies listed below and on every TfL site. This page will be continuously updated, as the tool is rolled out, to explain what sites your cookie settings have been applied to. See further detail on Cookiebot below .
In accordance with privacy legislation, TfL will prompt you to check your cookie settings from time to time.  If we make any major changes to our use of cookies our website will show you the consent management tool again.  Even if we don’t make any substantial changes you will be prompted to review your settings every 12 months to ensure your consent remains valid and up to date.
You can visit the
AboutCookies
website, for more information about cookies and how to manage them.
Some web browsers have a ‘Do not Track’ setting. If you’ve turned on the ‘Do not Track’ setting in your browser the cookie consent management tool will appear each time you link to a different TfL sub-domain eg from tfl.gov.uk to oyster.tfl.gov.uk.

What they do:
These cookies collect information about your browsing habits to make advertising content on the TfL website and other websites more relevant to you and your interests
The TfL websites will be scanned once a month to ensure the above cookie lists are kept up to date. Any new cookies will be categorised and blocked in accordance with your previously given cookie consent.
Third-party cookies
Embedded content
Sometimes, we embed images or videos from websites such as YouTube. As a result, when you visit a page featuring such content, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. We do not control these cookies and cannot prevent these sites or domains from collecting information on your use of this content.
You should check the relevant third-party website for more information about them and how to opt out. If you are not logged in to their services, they will not know who you are but may still gather anonymous usage information (eg number of views, plays, loads, etc).
Read more about
YouTube's privacy policy for embedded content.
Social networking and sharing tools
On some pages, we also feature embedded 'Share' buttons or widgets that enable you to share content with friends through a number of popular social networking sites (eg Twitter; Facebook 'Like', etc).
These sites may set cookies which can identify you as an individual when you are also logged in to their services. This means they may be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet, including on TfL sites. We do not control these cookies and you should check the relevant third-party website to see how your information is used and how to opt out.
Google Analytics
To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you view, you can
download and install a browser add-on
created by Google Analytics for this purpose
Web beacons
Some of our pages contain electronic images known as web beacons (or clear gifs), which allow us to count the number of visitors to these pages. Web beacons are usually only used to track the effectiveness of a particular advertisement, link or campaign. Some of these web beacons may be placed by third-party advertisers. You can visit the
AllAboutCookies website
to find out more about web beacons.
Phased implementation of Cookiebot
Cookiebot cannot be implemented on all TfL website domains at the same time, but your cookie settings will be automatically replicated on each site as the tool is implemented there. This page will be continuously updated to explain what sites your cookie settings have been applied to.  Until the introduction of Cookiebot the majority of TfL sites have displayed a banner (at appropriate intervals) or other related information, to provide details of cookies. This banner will continue to be displayed on sites until Cookiebot implementation is completed.
The above lists contain details of cookies that are used by websites that have not yet had the Cookiebot tool implemented, and whilst we continue the roll out some further sub-domain cookies are yet to be categorised, these unclassified cookies are listed below. We are in the process of classifying these.
The description of each cookie indicates which domain it originates from. Cookies that originate from a TfL sub-domain will only be placed on your device if you visit one of those sub-domains. To block these cookies you should update your browser settings.
You can set your web browser (eg Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc) to disable all cookies; allow only ‘trusted’ sites to set them; or accept cookies from websites only for the duration of your visit. If you choose to change your browser settings, you may find that certain functions and features will not work as intended.
Unclassified cookies are cookies that we are in the process of classifying, together with the providers of individual cookies.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.

We and our 918 advertising partners process your personal data using technology such as cookies in order to serve advertising, analyse our traffic and deliver customised experiences for you. You have a choice in who uses your data and for what purposes.
Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest. View our list of partners to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.
The Consent Signal (TC String) is stored in the Local Storage with a maximum retention period of 13 months, after which a renewed consent decision is required. Find out more about how your personal data is processed and set your preferences below.
You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Vendors
528
Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Vendors

Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.
Vendors

Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

Annex: The Data Protection Principles (General Data Protection Regulation Article 5)
Purpose
1. The objective of this policy is to ensure that:
(a) Personal Data is Processed by TfL in compliance with the requirements of data protection legislation and other relevant information governance legislation; and
(b) TfL Personnel are aware of their obligations when Processing Personal Data on behalf of TfL.
Definitions
2. Cyber Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT): a business unit within the Technology and Data department of Customers, Communication and Technology.
3. Data Controller: the organisation (alone, jointly or in common with other organisations) which determines the manner and purposes for which Personal Data is to be processed.
4. Data Processor: processes data on behalf of the Data Controller (other than an employee).
5. Data Protection Legislation: General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 and, any other legislation in force from time to time in the United Kingdom relating to privacy and/or the processing of personal data. Data protection legislation governs the way in which Data Controllers such as TfL can process an individual's Personal Data. It also gives individuals certain rights regarding the information that is held about them and obliges TfL to respond to any requests from an individual to access their own Personal Data.
6. Data Protection Officer: A statutory requirement of the GDPR is the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO). TfL and its subsidiaries will appoint a single DPO, reporting to a member of the Executive Committee and will ensure that the DPO is able to operate independently and is provided adequate resources to meet their GDPR obligations.
7. Data Protection Principles: a set of statutory requirements, which all Data Controllers are obliged to adhere to. The Principles balance the legitimate need for organisations such as TfL to process Personal Data against the need to protect the privacy rights of the Data Subject.
8. Data Subject: an individual who is the subject of Personal Data.
9. Information Commissioner: the regulator appointed by the Crown to promote public access to official information and protect personal information. Compliance with the Data Protection Legislation is enforced by the Information Commissioner.
10. Internal Audit: a department within the Risk and Assurance function of General Counsel.
11. Personal Data: any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified by that information, in particular by reference to an identifier, including name, identification number, location data or online identifier. Personal Data includes expressions of opinion and indications of intention, as well as factual information, and may include pseudonymised data where it is possible to attribute the pseudonym to a particular individual.
12. Personal Data Breach: the loss, destruction, damage, theft, inappropriate use or unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data.
13. Personal Information Custodians: senior managers, who are responsible for the Processing of Personal Data within their assigned area of control.
14. Privacy and Data Protection Team: a business unit within the Information Governance department of General Counsel.
15. Privacy Risk: that part of TfL's overall risk portfolio which relates to the, integrity, availability and confidentiality of Personal Data.
16. Processing/Processed: includes collecting, recording, storing, retrieving, transmitting, amending or altering, disclosing, deleting, archiving and destroying Personal Data.
17. TfL Personnel: includes all TfL employees as well as all temporary staff, contractors, consultants and any third parties with whom special arrangements (such as Data Processor, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements) have been made.
18. Transport for London (TfL): the statutory corporation and its operating subsidiaries.
Organisational scope

Annex: The Data Protection Principles (General Data Protection Regulation Article 5)
1. Personal data should be
a) processed fairly and lawfully and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.
TfL will use Personal Data fairly and identify a lawful basis for processing. In any circumstance in which individuals provide TfL with their Personal Data for the first time, or if it is processed for a new purpose, they will be informed of:
the identity and contact details of the Data Controller and Data Protection Officer;
the purposes and lawful basis for the processing;
any the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data;
the period for which the personal data will be stored;
the rights of the individual regarding the processing of their personal data including the rights to access and data portability, rectification and erasure, restriction of processing and the right to object to processing.
the consequences of not providing the personal data required under statute or for contractual purposes; and
the existence of, and rights relating to, automated decision making including profiling.
b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes
TfL will only process Personal Data for the purpose(s) which the Data Subject was previously informed of and it will not be used for any other purpose that is incompatible with the original purpose(s). Subject to appropriate safeguards being agreed with the Privacy and Data Protection team, further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes
c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimisation')
TfL will ensure that only the minimum Personal Data necessary for the purpose is processed and will not collect or hold Personal Data solely on the basis that it might be useful in the future. There should always be a legitimate business reason for the Processing of Personal Data linked to a specific ongoing purpose.
d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
Data will be inaccurate where it is incorrect or misleading as to any matters of fact.
There must be processes in place to maintain the quality of data capture at the point data is first collected or obtained by TfL, and to accurately amend, update or correct Personal Data.
e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed
Business areas must implement appropriate retention periods and ensure that Personal Data is securely destroyed once the purpose(s) for processing the Personal Data has come to an end; and there is no legal requirement or valid business/operational reason for its continued retention.
Personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures agreed with the Privacy and Data Protection Team.
f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures
TfL's standard contractual clauses on data protection must be used in any circumstances where Processing of Personal Data on behalf of TfL is carried out by a service provider or other third party.
The Privacy and Data Protection Team must be consulted in the early stages of any project or proposed change to a business process that has any significant implications for the Processing of Personal Data.
Personal Data will be managed in accordance with TfL's Information Security Policy.
TfL Personnel must report any actual or suspected incident, which either has or is likely to, result in the loss, theft, unauthorised disclosure, accidental destruction or other compromise of Personal Data directly to CSIRT and the Privacy and Data Protection Team in accordance with the Data Breach Procedures.
TfL will comply with the restrictions in data protection legislation on the transfer of Personal Data outside the UK and the European Economic Area (which consists of the member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein). The Privacy and Data Protection Team must be consulted in advance of any such transfers being undertaken or agreed.

We and our 918 advertising partners process your personal data using technology such as cookies in order to serve advertising, analyse our traffic and deliver customised experiences for you. You have a choice in who uses your data and for what purposes.
Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest. View our list of partners to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.
The Consent Signal (TC String) is stored in the Local Storage with a maximum retention period of 13 months, after which a renewed consent decision is required. Find out more about how your personal data is processed and set your preferences below.
You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Vendors

Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Vendors

Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Vendors

Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.
Vendors

Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.
Match and combine data from other data sources
Information about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Link different devices
In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).
Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.
Use precise geolocation data
With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
Actively scan device characteristics for identification
With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

This page explains how we protect your privacy when using our web services. It describes the information we collect and the procedures we have in place to safeguard your privacy.
Personal information we collect about
you
How we use your personal information
Protecting your information
Cookies
Changes to this privacy statement
This privacy statement applies to data collected by the websites of TfL and its subsidiary companies, including:
Docklands Light Railway
London River Services
London Transport Museum
London Underground
Rail for London
Victoria Coach Station
Personal information we collect about
you
You can browse our websites without disclosing any
information about yourself.
By entering your details in any fields requested,
such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number, or
date of birth, you enable TfL and its subsidiaries to provide you with the
service(s) you select, the information that you have asked for, or to resolve a query or complaint you have made.
In all cases, we will only request information we
need to provide you with the service(s) you have requested.
How we use your personal information
When we collect information from you, we will tell
you if we would like to send you information about our products and services or
transport-related issues.
We will give you the opportunity to opt out.
If we wish to share your data with third parties
for marketing purposes, we will tell you about this and only do so if we get
your consent.
We will give you the opportunity to opt in.
We may disclose your personal data to our
subsidiaries, train operating companies which accept Oyster for travel on their
services and our service providers.
These service providers may include train companies
providing services on the DLR and London Overground, bus companies and those
that administer the Congestion Charge and provide ticketing and information
services.
TfL may also share your personal information with
the police and other law enforcement agencies for the purposes of crime
prevention or detection.
If we disclose your information, we ask the
organisation to demonstrate that the data will assist in the prevention or
detection of crime, or that TfL is legally obliged to disclose it.
This is done on a strictly case-by-case basis and
through a tightly controlled process to ensure we comply with data
protection legislation.
Protecting your information
We use up-to-date industry procedures to protect
your personal information.
We also protect the security of your data using
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.
We have appropriate security measures in place to
protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have
collected from you via our websites.
The internet, however, is not generally a secure
medium of communication and we cannot guarantee the security of any information
you input on this website or send to us via the internet.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of text that a website
transfers to your computer's hard disk so it can remember who you are. Cookies
are generally used to monitor how a website is used and improve your online
experience. They do not give us access to the rest of your computer and are
not used to identify you personally.

cookies
we set, what they are
used for and how to manage and delete them.
Changes to this privacy statement
It's likely that we'll need to update this statement from time to time, so check back here regularly to find out more.
Your continued use of the site will mean that you accept those revisions.
