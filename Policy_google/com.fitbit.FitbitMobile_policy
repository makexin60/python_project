Who We Are and How To Contact Us
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you use our Services, we collect the following types of information, some of which may be considered Consumer Health Data as defined in certain U.S. state laws such as the Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370.
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender, height, weight, and in some cases your mobile telephone number. This is the only information you have to provide to create an account with us. You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and community username.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services.
You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking accounts, or using the contact list on your mobile device. We do not store your contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends.
If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message.
PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION
Some Fitbit devices support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information. You can remove the token from your account using your account settings. We do not store your transaction history.
If you purchase Fitbit merchandise on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. We do not store this payment information. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order. Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms.
LIVE COACHING SERVICES
Our live coaching services are a platform for you to communicate with a live health, fitness, or wellness coach (“Live Coaching Services”). Coaches may be provided by third parties, such as your employer or insurance company, or by our third-party coaching service providers. If you use our Live Coaching Services, we collect information about such use, including the plan, goals, and actions you record with your coach, your calendar events, communications with your coach, notes your coach records about you, and other information submitted by you or your coach.
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES
DEVICE INFORMATION
Your device collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, and location. The data collected varies depending on which device you use. Learn more about the features of
our various devices
and how you can use
MobileTrack
. When your device syncs with our applications or software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device to our servers.
GEOLOCATION INFORMATION
The Services include features that use precise geolocation data, including GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location. You can always remove our access using your Fitbit device or mobile device settings. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
USAGE INFORMATION
When you access or use our Services, we receive certain usage or network activity information. This includes information about your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, create or log into your account, pair your device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Fitbit device.
We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access the Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Fitbit or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES
If you choose to connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access to your exercise or activity data from another service. You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service.
We may partner with third parties, such as employers and insurance companies that offer Fitbit Services to their employees and customers. In such cases, those companies may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION
We use the information we collect with your consent or to provide the Services you request, including for the following purposes.
PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES
Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our
Terms of Service
contract with you. For example, we need to use your information to provide you with your Fitbit dashboard tracking your exercise, activity, and other trends; to enable the community features of the Services; and to give you customer support.
For the Services’ community features, we may use your information to help you find and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their contact list, we show that user that you are a user of the Services.
If you use the Live Coaching Services, we use your information to connect you with coaches, allow you to communicate with them through our Services, and help you achieve your goals to lead a healthier, more active life. For example, the goals that you provide allow you to develop a personal plan and set of actions in consultation with your coach.
IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES
We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; and develop new features and Services, which may include generative artificial intelligence models.
When you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to provide and improve features of the Services such as recording where a workout took place or mapping an activity.
We also use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content as part of providing the services you request. Here are some examples:
Information like your height, weight, gender, and age allows us to improve the accuracy of your daily exercise and activity statistics like the number of calories you burned and the distance you traveled.
Based on your sleep data, we may make inferences about your sleeping patterns and provide you with customized insights to help you improve your sleep.
We may personalize exercise and activity goals for you based on the goals you previously set and your historical exercise or activity data.
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU
We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your notification preferences in account settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email.
PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY
We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the Services, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies.
HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED
We never sell the personal information of our users. We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described below.
WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE
You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use our community features like the forums, 7-day leaderboard, and other social tools. For certain information, we provide you with privacy preferences in account settings and other tools to control how your information is visible to other users of the Services.
You may also direct us to share your information in other ways, for example, when you give a third-party application access to your account, or give your employer access to information when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings
.
FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING
We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us, based on our instructions, and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research, and surveys.
FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM
We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person.
Please note: Our policy is to notify you of legal process seeking access to your information, such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person.
We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services.
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity.
FOR JOINT PROCESSING OF PROFILE INFORMATION
From June 6, 2023, Fitbit users have the opportunity to move their accounts to Google. This means that some Fitbit users will be part of the Google service while others may remain part of the Fitbit service. As a result, to ensure our users can still view their friends lists (including where your friends move their service to Google), Fitbit and Google will share with each other limited profile information about their Fitbit users, notably the user’s name, photo, and friends list. For more information see the
JOINT PROCESSING FOR PROFILE INFORMATION
section below.
YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We give you
account settings
and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live. If you live in certain jurisdictions, you may have legal rights with respect to your information, which your
account settings
and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below.
Accessing and Exporting Data.
By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard with your daily exercise and activity statistics. Using your account settings, you can also download information in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, foods, and sleep. Learn more
here
.
Editing and Deleting Data.
By logging into your account and using your account settings, you can change and delete your personal information. For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your account if you wish. Learn more
here
.
If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Fitbit device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in the
How Information Is Shared
section.
Objecting to Data Use.
We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us; and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account. You can also use the Fitbit application to unpair your device from your account at any time.
DATA RETENTION
We keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends on the Services, we delete the list after it is used for adding contacts as friends. We keep other information, like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the Services. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the
How We Use Information
and
How Information Is Shared
sections.
ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS
We work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services. This includes helping us understand how users interact with the Services, serving advertisements on our behalf across the internet, and measuring the performance of those advertisements. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and other websites and applications. To learn more and about your privacy choices, please read our Cookie Use statement.
OUR POLICIES FOR CHILDREN
We appreciate the importance of taking additional measures to protect children’s privacy.
Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate
Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts
which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account.
Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at
data-protection-office@fitbit.com
.
INFORMATION SECURITY
We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt many of our Services. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact
Customer Support
.
OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS
We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy. Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. For a list of the locations where we have offices, please contact us.
We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data to third countries around the world. These include the following:
1. Adequacy Decisions
European Commission’s
, the
United Kingdom’s
and
Switzerland’s
Adequacy Decisions.

Annex I to the DPF Principles
.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and

you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Information Google collects
What types of data are collected when I use Fitbit’s devices and services?
Google’s
Privacy Policy
applies to Fitbit’s devices and services and explains what information we collect; why we collect it; and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.
Categories of data collected
In addition to the data described in the
Privacy Policy
, when you use Fitbit devices and services, we save:
Setup information that is required to register, such as height, weight, and sex to calculate your stride length and to estimate distance, basal metabolic rate, and calorie burn. You may also choose to provide other types of setup information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and community username.
Health and wellness data like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, your manual entry in the Fitbit app, and/or services you connected to your Fitbit experience, like third party apps (e.g., Strava). The data collected varies depending on which device you use.
Learn more
.
Precise geolocation data for select features, including location from GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. This type of data is collected if you grant access to your location. You can always remove access using your Fitbit device or mobile device settings. The Fitbit service may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
Learn more
.
Usage, network activity information and diagnostics data when you access or use Fitbit. This includes information about your interaction with Fitbit, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, log into Fitbit, pair your Fitbit device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Fitbit device. Data about the devices and computers you use to access Fitbit are also collected, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Fitbit or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.
More about data from your Fitbit devices and services
Additional details about how specific Fitbit devices and services collect data vary by device or service and how you configure your device or service, as described
here
.
Optional features and data
Fitbit services include optional features (e.g., menstrual health, glucose tracking, irregular rhythm notifications, ECG, snore & noise detection) that you can turn on and turn off at any time. Before you turn an optional feature on, you’re informed about data it collects and processes and how that data is used.
For example, if you decide to enable glucose tracking, we will collect, store, and process the blood glucose levels you manually log in the Fitbit app or import from a connected app or device to help you track your blood glucose levels over time or against any target range you set. You can turn this feature off, and download or delete your glucose data, at any time in Fitbit settings.
Additionally, for our regulated medical device software, to meet regulatory requirements, we may compile, analyze, and share your aggregate and de-identified data with regulatory bodies. None of the data used for these purposes will include your name, email, or any other information that directly identifies you.
What types of data does Fitbit receive from and share with third parties?
If you choose to connect your Fitbit account with another third party app, we may receive information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Strava, Fitbit may receive information like your profile, activity, location, heart rate, weight. You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service.
You may also choose to share certain data from your Fitbit account with third party apps through Health Connect on Android. You can stop sharing information to other services through Health Connect in your Fitbit app settings or directly in Health Connect settings.
We may also partner with third party entities, such as employers and insurance companies, that offer Fitbit devices and services to their employees and customers via a Fitbit Care program. In such cases, those entities may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services.
Learn more about Fitbit Care
.
What type of payment information does Fitbit collect?
If you choose to activate Fitbit Pay, we will collect certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit, or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information. You can remove the token from your account using your account settings. We do not store your transaction history.
What types of data does Fitbit collect from children?
We offer Google accounts for children under the age of 13, or applicable age in your country, and allow these children to sign in to Fitbit using their own Google Account. The
Privacy Notice for Google Accounts Created with Family Link
and the
Google Privacy Policy
describe our privacy practices when your child uses Fitbit with their Google Account.
Remember that when your child is signed in to Fitbit with their Google Account, the information we collect, including activity related health and wellness data (e.g., like their steps taken and active minutes, and sleep duration) will be stored with their Google Account.
Information you provide us
When you create an account for your child, we’ll ask for personal information about them, like their height and sex. This information is used to calculate metrics like activity stats. You or your child may choose to share certain additional information (like location, birthday) with us.
Information we collect from your child’s use of our services
Your child’s Fitbit device collects data to track their activity during the day, including their steps, sleep, and active minutes. When their Fitbit devices sync with a Fitbit app, data on your child’s Fitbit device will be transferred to our servers, and attached to their Google Account. Fitbit does not collect location tracking data from your child.
When your child logs into the Fitbit app with their Google Account, we automatically collect and store information about account connectivity such as IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, and app and mobile device information (including cookie and application identifiers).
How we use the information we collect
We use your child’s information:  to provide, maintain, and improve Fitbit services; to authenticate users’ identities; to track activities and exercise; to measure performance and understand how our services are used; and to help improve the safety and reliability of our services.
We also use your child’s information to help them connect with other, guardian-approved Fitbit users. Once a guardian accepts a friend request for your child, your child’s personal info and statistics will be shared based on the child’s privacy settings.
Information your child can share
Your child’s display name, avatar, about me information, and the date they joined Fitbit are shared when establishing a friend connection. Average daily step count is also shared with friends. Other personal info and statistics are only shared with approved connections based on the child’s privacy settings.
Information Google shares
Information we collect may be shared outside of Google in limited circumstances. We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of Fitbit unless one of the following applies:
With consent
We will share personal information outside of Google with consent (as applicable).
For external processing
We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and subject to other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
For legal reasons
We may disclose information to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Fitbit service or the physical safety of any person.
How you can access or delete your child’s Fitbit data
You can view some of your child’s Fitbit data by viewing their profile. Note that this process will only allow you to view some of your child’s information. If your child has a Google Account, you can access, update, remove, export, and restrict the processing of your child’s information by signing into their Google Account and going to
Fitbit Data and Privacy
settings.  If you do not remember your child’s password, you can reset it through the Family Link app or
Family Link settings on the web
.
You can delete your child’s Fitbit data by navigating to your
Google Account
, and clicking on your child’s profile under Programs and Family. Your child will have the ability to delete their Fitbit data by going to their
Fitbit Data and Privacy
settings in their Google Account.
How Google uses data to improve services
How is data used across my Fitbit devices and services?
Google’s
Privacy Policy
applies to Fitbit devices and services and explains what information we collect; why we collect it; and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. In addition, read the
commitments
we made to global regulators to understand the safeguards Google applies in handling your Fitbit information.
At Fitbit, our products and services use data from your paired devices and services to help you reach your health and fitness goals. This means providing Google services and experiences related to health and wellness, improving and personalizing them and developing new ones, and keeping you informed of relevant Google products, services, and updates.
Some examples of how we use data to make features and services that help you live healthier
:
Provide and maintain Fitbit services
:  We need to use your information to provide you with your Fitbit dashboard, which tracks your exercise, activity, and other trends. For community features, we may use your information to help you find and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with you.
Supporting useful features
:  You can enable Google Assistant to access your Fitbit sleep and activity data, and Assistant can then use this data to answer your sleep- or activity-related questions across your devices that have personal results turned on.
Personalize features
:  We may use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content: e.g., based on your sleep data, we can make inferences about your sleeping patterns and provide you with customized insights to help you improve your sleep. Or, when you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to record where a workout took place or to map an activity.
Improve existing features
:  We aggregate data to improve our algorithms or use it to troubleshoot and improve the performance, safety, and reliability of our Fitbit devices and services.
Keeping you informed of Google products, services, and updates
:  We use your information when needed to send you notifications related to your Fitbit devices and services, and some of our promotions will be personalized to you based on your use of Fitbit devices and services. For example, we will let you know when new features are available for your device, when devices are on sale, or when new devices are available for pre-order. But we’ll always respect your choice about whether you want to receive promotional emails from Google by going to your Fitbit app settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in the email.
Promote safety and security
:  We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of Fitbit services, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies.
How can I better understand the limits on Google’s use of data from my Fitbit devices and services?
Privacy is still at the core of the Fitbit experience and Fitbit’s commitment to privacy continues for Google Account users on Fitbit.
Your Fitbit health and wellness data won’t be used for Google Ads, and it will continue to be kept separate from Google Ads data.
I’m thinking of moving from my existing Fitbit Account to a Google Account.  How do I learn more?
If you move to Google, your Fitbit data will be associated with your Google Account.  Google will handle this data as described in the
Google Privacy Policy
and these FAQs.  You will also be subject to the
Google Terms of Service
, as supplemented by
these Fitbit Additional Terms of Service
.
If you’re based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, unless stated otherwise in any additional terms, Google services (including the Fitbit services if you migrate) are provided by Google Ireland Limited, a company incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland (Registered Number: 368047), and located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
If you’re based in the United Kingdom, unless stated otherwise in any additional terms, Google services (including the Fitbit services if you migrate) are provided by Google LLC, a company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA, and located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
If you don’t move your Fitbit Account to a Google Account, you’ll remain subject to existing terms and privacy policies of Fitbit LLC.
How can I help Fitbit build better products and advance health research?
Fitbit and Google are committed to helping everyone, everywhere, be healthier. As part of this mission, we want to understand how the human body works, how to accurately measure health, and how to encourage people to lead healthier lives.
You can choose to be an important part of this mission by participating in research, and the first step begins during your registration or your Google migration. If you agree to participate, Fitbit and Google will collect and use your data to research and develop new health and wellness products and services. Data that is used for research is de-identified, meaning it will not include information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email, or other information that directly identifies you). This data may include your:
Health and wellness data, such as steps, heart rate, and sleep data
Data from a device that you connect to Fitbit
The choice to opt into or out of research is up to you. You can opt into and out of research at any time. You can review your consent, update your consent status, download or delete your data in your Google Account settings. If you revoke your consent, your data will not be used to research and develop new products and services or to support health research.
You may also have the opportunity to enroll in optional research studies in the Fitbit app. Before enrolling, you will have the opportunity to review and agree to an informed consent document to make an informed decision about participation in the study.
Your data may also be used to generate findings that could be included in publications (such as science journals or Fitbit blog articles) to contribute to general knowledge about health and science. We do not share data that could identify any particular individual without your consent.
Sharing your information
When you use Fitbit’s devices and services, your data may be shared with third parties as explained in the
Google Privacy Policy
(and in more detail below).  We also explain in this section how information is shared across your Fitbit devices and services and among members of your Fitbit family.
What data is shared when I use social features?
The social element of Fitbit known as Fitbit Community includes a number of social features. These include:  users’ ability to make friend connections and join closed groups; private messaging features; users’ ability to post in closed groups and to comment on or react to other posts in groups they are members of; and 7-day step leaderboards in closed groups.
Learn more about Fitbit’s social features
. In addition, Fitbit users can contribute to community forums at
community.fitbit.com
.
How we use the information we collect
As part of Fitbit Community, we use your information to help you find and connect with other Fitbit users and to allow other users to find and connect with you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you as a friend. When another user has your email in their contact list or in their friend network on a connected service, we show that user that you are a user of the Fitbit service.
Information you can share
Your display name, profile photo and the date you joined Fitbit are shared when joining a closed group. Similarly, your display name, profile photo, about me info, and the date you joined Fitbit are shared when establishing a friend connection. Average daily step count is also shared with friends and group leaderboards, unless changed in privacy settings. For certain other information (e.g., birthday, sex and weight), we provide you with privacy preferences in account settings and other tools to control how your information is visible to other users of Fitbit. You may also direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use our community features like the
community forums
.
What data is shared when I enable connections with other apps?
You have the option to share your information in other ways; for example, when you give a third-party application access to your account, or give your employer access to information when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. Each connection is optional, and you can manage what you share in account settings. You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings. Keep in mind that their use of your information is determined by their privacy policies and terms.
Will I be able to communicate with friends who use a Google Account to log into Fitbit, if I haven’t yet migrated to a Google Account?
We’re giving existing Fitbit users the option to move their Fitbit experience to a Google Account, and new Fitbit users are required to register with a Google Account. Some existing Fitbit users haven’t decided to move their Fitbit experience to a Google Account yet, and continue to use a Fitbit Account.
Because of this, to make sure all Fitbit users can still see their friends lists if they use their Fitbit experience with a Google Account or a Fitbit Account, Fitbit and Google share limited profile information about their Fitbit users (users’ name, photo and friends list). This is called “Joint Processing”. Fitbit users with a Google Account won’t see messages, posts, comments, taunts, and cheers from friends or people in their closed group with a Fitbit Account until they move their Fitbit experience to a Google Account.
(1) Fitbit International Limited and Google Ireland Limited (for users in the EEA or Switzerland) and (2) Fitbit International Limited and Google LLC (for users in the UK) are joint controllers for this Joint Processing and Fitbit and Google remain responsible for their respective obligations under data protection law.
You can contact Google and our data protection office
if you have additional questions or want to exercise your rights in respect of Joint Processing, including your right of objection.
Exporting, deleting, and protecting your information
How can I access and download my data?
By logging into the Fitbit app, you can access much of your personal information, including your daily exercise and activity statistics and other health and wellness data. You can also log into your
Fitbit Dashboard
to see some of the same information.
By accessing your
Fitbit Data and Privacy
settings in your
Google Account
, you can export your data in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, food, sleep and more.
Learn more
.
How can I delete data associated with my use of Fitbit devices and services?
You can update name and birthday used in Fitbit by updating your
Google Account personal info
. Other personal data in Fitbit such as sex, height, weight and display name can be updated in the Fitbit app or through
Fitbit Settings
. If you change your sex, height, weight, and display name, your previous entries are not kept.
You can delete selected health and wellness data history through your
Fitbit Data and Privacy
settings or leave Fitbit by deleting the Fitbit service.
What retention periods apply to my data?
Your Fitbit health and wellness data, like exercise, activity, sleep, stress data, are kept until you choose to delete the data or leave Fitbit because Fitbit uses this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of Fitbit. Your Fitbit profile information, like sex, is also kept for as long as you stay with Fitbit. Other information about you and your use of Fitbit is kept for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm.
In some cases, when you add information for a Fitbit feature, data is deleted after it is no longer needed for the feature. For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends, the list is deleted after it is used for adding contacts as friends.
How do I unsubscribe from marketing emails?
Fitbit uses your information when needed to send you notifications about Fitbit and to respond to you when you contact us.
With your permission, Fitbit also uses your information to promote new features or products that might interest you. You can control marketing communications and most Fitbit notifications by using your
notification preferences
or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email.
How can I leave the Fitbit?
You can leave Fitbit at any time through your
Fitbit Data and Privacy
settings. Leaving the Fitbit service will permanently delete associated Fitbit data from your Google Account but will not affect other Google services.
How can I delete my Google Account?
You can delete your Google Account at any time through the
Data & Privacy section of your Google Account
. Deleting the Google Account used for Fitbit will also delete your Fitbit data.
Learn more about deleting your Google Account
.
How can I delete data in my Fitbit devices?

Last update: September 16, 2024
Note
: If you use your Fitbit devices and services with a Google Account, then your data will be handled as described in the
Google Privacy Policy

Who We Are and How To Contact Us
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you use our Services, we collect the following types of information, some of which may be considered Consumer Health Data as defined in certain U.S. state laws such as the Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370.
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender, height, weight, and in some cases your mobile telephone number. This is the only information you have to provide to create an account with us. You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and community username.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services.
You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking accounts, or using the contact list on your mobile device. We do not store your contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends.
If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message.
PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION
Some Fitbit devices support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information. You can remove the token from your account using your account settings. We do not store your transaction history.
If you purchase Fitbit merchandise on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. We do not store this payment information. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order.

Our live coaching services are a platform for you to communicate with a live health, fitness, or wellness coach (“Live Coaching Services”). Coaches may be provided by third parties, such as your employer or insurance company, or by our third-party coaching service providers. If you use our Live Coaching Services, we collect information about such use, including the plan, goals, and actions you record with your coach, your calendar events, communications with your coach, notes your coach records about you, and other information submitted by you or your coach.
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES
DEVICE INFORMATION
Your device collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, and location. The data collected varies depending on which device you use. Learn more about the features of
our various devices
and how you can use
MobileTrack
. When your device syncs with our applications or software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device to our servers.
GEOLOCATION INFORMATION
The Services include features that use precise geolocation data, including GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location. You can always remove our access using your Fitbit device or mobile device settings. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
USAGE INFORMATION
When you access or use our Services, we receive certain usage or network activity information. This includes information about your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, create or log into your account, pair your device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Fitbit device.
We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access the Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Fitbit or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES
If you choose to connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access to your exercise or activity data from another service. You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service.
We may partner with third parties, such as employers and insurance companies that offer Fitbit Services to their employees and customers. In such cases, those companies may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION
We use the information we collect with your consent or to provide the Services you request, including for the following purposes.
PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES
Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our
Terms of Service
contract with you. For example, we need to use your information to provide you with your Fitbit dashboard tracking your exercise, activity, and other trends; to enable the community features of the Services; and to give you customer support.
For the Services’ community features, we may use your information to help you find and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their contact list, we show that user that you are a user of the Services.
If you use the Live Coaching Services, we use your information to connect you with coaches, allow you to communicate with them through our Services, and help you achieve your goals to lead a healthier, more active life. For example, the goals that you provide allow you to develop a personal plan and set of actions in consultation with your coach.
IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES
We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; and develop new features and Services, which may include generative artificial intelligence models.
When you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to provide and improve features of the Services such as recording where a workout took place or mapping an activity.
We also use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content as part of providing the services you request. Here are some examples:
Information like your height, weight, gender, and age allows us to improve the accuracy of your daily exercise and activity statistics like the number of calories you burned and the distance you traveled.
Based on your sleep data, we may make inferences about your sleeping patterns and provide you with customized insights to help you improve your sleep.
We may personalize exercise and activity goals for you based on the goals you previously set and your historical exercise or activity data.
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU
We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your notification preferences in account settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email.
PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY
We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the Services, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies.
HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED
We never sell the personal information of our users. We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described below.
WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE
You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use our community features like the forums, 7-day leaderboard, and other social tools. For certain information, we provide you with privacy preferences in account settings and other tools to control how your information is visible to other users of the Services.
You may also direct us to share your information in other ways, for example, when you give a third-party application access to your account, or give your employer access to information when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings
.
FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING
We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us, based on our instructions, and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research, and surveys.
FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM
We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person.
Please note: Our policy is to notify you of legal process seeking access to your information, such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person.
We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services.
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity.
FOR JOINT PROCESSING OF PROFILE INFORMATION
From June 6, 2023, Fitbit users have the opportunity to move their accounts to Google. This means that some Fitbit users will be part of the Google service while others may remain part of the Fitbit service. As a result, to ensure our users can still view their friends lists (including where your friends move their service to Google), Fitbit and Google will share with each other limited profile information about their Fitbit users, notably the user’s name, photo, and friends list. For more information see the
JOINT PROCESSING FOR PROFILE INFORMATION
section below.
YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We give you
account settings
and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live. If you live in certain jurisdictions, you may have legal rights with respect to your information, which your
account settings
and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below.
Accessing and Exporting Data.
By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard with your daily exercise and activity statistics. Using your account settings, you can also download information in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, foods, and sleep. Learn more
here
.
Editing and Deleting Data.
By logging into your account and using your account settings, you can change and delete your personal information. For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your account if you wish. Learn more
here
.
If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Fitbit device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in the
How Information Is Shared
section.
Objecting to Data Use.
We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us; and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account. You can also use the Fitbit application to unpair your device from your account at any time.
DATA RETENTION
We keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends on the Services, we delete the list after it is used for adding contacts as friends. We keep other information, like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the Services. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the
How We Use Information
and
How Information Is Shared
sections.
ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS
We work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services. This includes helping us understand how users interact with the Services, serving advertisements on our behalf across the internet, and measuring the performance of those advertisements. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and other websites and applications. To learn more and about your privacy choices, please read our Cookie Use statement.
OUR POLICIES FOR CHILDREN
We appreciate the importance of taking additional measures to protect children’s privacy.
Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate
Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts
which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account.
Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at
data-protection-office@fitbit.com
.
INFORMATION SECURITY
We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt many of our Services. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact
Customer Support
.
OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS
We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy.

Fitbit Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts
Last Update: February 2, 2024
Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children's Account”). This Privacy Policy for Children's Accounts explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from your child's use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. This policy applies only to Children's Accounts set up specifically for children under 13 or any higher minimum age in your jurisdiction for use with qualifying devices. You can find additional information about how Fitbit collects, uses, and shares information in the
Fitbit Privacy Policy
.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US
When you create an account for your child, we'll ask for personal information about them, like their name, date of birth, gender, height, and weight. You or your child may choose to share certain additional information with us.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOUR CHILD'S USE OF OUR SERVICES
Your child's Fitbit device collects data to track their activity during the day. This includes their steps, sleep, active minutes, and more. When their devices sync with a Fitbit app, data on their device is transferred to our servers. Fitbit does not collect location tracking data from your child.
When your child accesses his or her account through the Fitbit app, we automatically collect and store information about account connectivity such as IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, and app and mobile device information (including cookie and application identifiers)
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We use the information in the following ways: to provide, personalize, and improve our services, authenticate users' identities, to track activities and exercise, and to provide customer support. We also use the data we collect for internal purposes such as troubleshooting, protecting against errors, data analysis and testing, to develop new features and services, and to promote the safety and security of Fitbit.
We also use the information we collect to help children connect with other, guardian-approved Fitbit users which are displayed within the family account.
HOW YOUR CHILD'S INFORMATION IS SHARED
WITH YOUR CHILD'S FITBIT CONNECTIONS
Your child's username, name, activity, and picture are shared with approved connections in the family account.
Information we collect may be shared outside of Fitbit in limited circumstances. We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of Fitbit unless one of the following applies:
FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING
We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and subject to other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
OWNERSHIP CHANGES
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give you notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity.
FOR LEGAL REASONS
We may disclose information to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person.
HOW TO ACCESS AND DELETE YOUR CHILD'S PERSONAL INFORMATION
As a parent, you have control of any child's account within your family account. Once you have signed in to your Fitbit account, verified your email address, and created a family account you can create an account for your child. You can view your child's complete account at any time through your family account.
If at any time you wish to stop further collection or use of your child's information, you can delete your child's account by either (1) contacting
Customer Support
, or (2) deleting your child from the family account and confirming your intent to delete the account in the email we send you.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR CHILD TURNS 13
When your child turns 13 (or any higher minimum age required for the creation of a Fitbit account without parental consent in your country), he or she will be eligible to independently manage his or her account. If your child chooses to manage his or her Fitbit account, you will no longer have access to, or be able to exercise control over it through your Fitbit account.
HOW TO CONTACT US
If you have questions, suggestions, or concerns about this policy, or about our use of your child's information, please contact us at data-protection-office@fitbit.com or at our mailing address below.
