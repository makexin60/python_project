Data Erasure.
In certain jurisdictions, you can request that your personal
            information be deleted. Please note that if you request the erasure
            of your personal information:
We may retain your personal information as necessary for our
                legitimate business interests, such as prevention of money
                laundering, fraud detection and prevention, and enhancing
                safety. For example, if we suspend a DWWA account for fraud or
                safety reasons, we may retain information from that DWWA Account
                to prevent that Member from opening a new DWWA Account in the
                future.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent
                necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example,
                Payments may keep information for tax, legal reporting and
                auditing obligations.
Because we take measures to protect data from accidental or
                malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal
                information may not be removed from our backup systems for a
                limited period of time.
To request your account to be deleted please click on the "Submit
            Request" button. You will then receive an email for you to confirm
            that you would like your account deleted. Once you have confirmed
            deletion we will review your account and delete the applicable data
            (the only exceptions are records that we need to keep for legal
            obligations). We will respond to you within 30 days to confirm your
            account has been deleted and or what records we have had to keep for
            legal obligations.
