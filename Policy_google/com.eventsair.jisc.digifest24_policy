Política de Privacidade - Português
Introduction
Pearson, its Affiliates, and its agents (
“Pearson”
) are committed to data security and the fair and transparent processing of personal data. This privacy policy describes how Pearson treats the information you provide to us or that we otherwise collect. This Privacy Policy also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
“You”
refers to the person or entity using the Service. The
“Service”
is the digital credentialing and certification functionality, associated insights and connection to relevant career, education and training opportunities provided through any website or application offered by Pearson.
“Personal Data”
includes the data we collect directly from you as well as personal data from Issuers (defined below) and Third-Party Services (defined below). This Privacy Policy sets out how we will treat the Personal Data which you provide to us in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.
We will not share your Personal Data except on a need-to-know basis with other companies under common ownership or control with Pearson (“
Affiliates”)
, our attorneys, auditors, consultants, and service providers who are under confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.
Pearson owns and operates Credly.com and YourAcclaim.com. This Policy, together with our website terms of use and any other documents referred to in them, sets out the basis on which Pearson processes Personal Data.
Please read this Policy carefully as it contains important information on who we are, how and why we collect, store, use and share personal data, your rights in relation to your personal data, how to contact us and supervisory authorities in the event that you would like to report a concern about the way in which we process your data.
This Privacy Policy describes our broadest potential use of your Personal Data, although we may actually make far less use. The basis for our processing of your Personal Data is your informed consent. No law requires you to provide us with your Personal Data. You may withdraw your consent for us to process your Personal Data at any time, but that may preclude you thereafter from using the Website and the Service. We will delete your Personal Data following the withdrawal of your consent, however, such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to withdrawal.
Pearson collects Personal Data when you choose to submit it through e-mail, an online form, or other method. We also collect information through cookies (see “
Pearson Use of ‘Cookies
’
”).
Pearson also maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to our websites, including but not limited to, internet protocol (“IP”) address (a computer's numerical Internet address), third party websites from which visitors access our website, type of web browsers used, and pages viewed. Such information may include Personal Data.
By your use of the Service you consent to our use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Who are we?
Credly is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NCS Pearson, Inc with an ultimate parent company of Pearson plc.
The Pearson Service is an internet-based, hosted platform designed to enable subscribers to the Service (
“Issuers”
) to issue digital badges and credentials (
“Credentials”
) to individuals who meet prescribed requirements (
“Users”
), and for those Users to display the Credentials online on the Service or on third party sites, as elected by Users.
We may provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of, or with, Pearson under confidentiality agreements to help Pearson provide the Service. They may also assist Pearson in communicating with you about the Service and about offers from Pearson and our partners, where you have provided us consent to do so.
For the purposes of the GDPR, Pearson is the ‘processor’ of certain types of Personally Identifiable Data provided by Issuers and the ‘controller’ of other types of Personally Identifiable Data provided directly to us by Users. Pearson offers a Data Protection Agreement (DPA) for qualifying organizations, which you can find online at https://info.credly.com/data-processing-addendum.
You may contact our Primary Point of Contact for data privacy and security with any questions, comments or concerns about this policy by sending an email to
privacy@credly.com
.
What personal data do we collect?
We may collect and process the following personal data:
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US
To register for or use the Service, you will be prompted to give us certain required information about yourself, such as your name and email address. When you configure your account settings, you may enter additional, optional information about yourself. You may, at times, also send us an e-mail which may contain not only your e-mail address, but other information about you, including home or business addresses, telephone numbers, or account details. The information you give us may also include statements you make on the Service such as testimonials, services reviews, or other statements that may identify you personally.
When an Issuer issues you a Credential, we will provide you with a user ID (the e-mail address provided by the Issuer) and account activation e-mail for you to access the Service and create a user “profile” for use as described below. Alternatively, you may directly create an account on the Service by entering your email address, name, and country. When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your profile, which contains the information supplied to us by you or the Issuer. In addition to the information required to establish your account, including your name, email, password and country, you may provide some or all of the following information, including but not limited to, a photograph of yourself, a short biographical blurb, your state/province, your city, your zip code, your current employer, your current job title, your birth year, and your website URL. You will be able to update or correct any of the contact information in your profile at any time. You may receive certain e-mails relating to your use of the Service. If you receive another Credential from other Issuers, your user ID will be authorized to access the Service, and your contact information will be added to the participant list for that Issuer.
If you have consented or opted in to receiving news and updates from Pearson on professional growth or further education opportunities, you have the right at any time to prevent us from further contacting you by following the unsubscribe or opt-out instructions included in the relevant email or through the privacy tools provided to you through the Service.
We may use your Personal Data to contact you regarding your use of the Service, for customer support purposes, and to inform you of updates, modifications and other matters relating to the Service, and information about others services that we offer in accordance with your subscription preferences. You may decline to receive mail or e-mail from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service by selecting the opt-out link contained in any such e-mail or by contacting us at
privacy@credly.com
.
You may request that Pearson provide third-parties access to your publicly accessible personal information. Pearson will not provide your personal information to a third-party without your consent.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
Pearson also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service, a log of users' IP addresses, the third-party Website from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance (collectively,
“Usage Log Information”
). For purposes of maintaining and enhancing Service performance and security, Pearson may use Usage Log Information, information about your browser, and other local computer settings. We also may use Usage Log Information to tailor our communications to you about the Service, and contact you in relation to providing support. We also may aggregate Usage Log Information to create or publish statistical analyses and reports about Service usage. We will not authorize the publication of Personal Information about any user without the prior written consent of such person.
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM ISSUERS
Issuers provide Personal Information to us, including first name, last name, email address, and Credential. The use of information collected from Issuers shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which these Organizations have engaged Pearson.
Pearson collects information directly from the Issuer or directly from the User. If you would no longer like to be contacted by one of the Issuers that use our service, please contact the Issuer that you interact with directly.
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct or amend inaccurate Credentials should direct their query to the Issuer. We retain Personal Information we process on behalf of the Issuers for as long as needed to provide services to the Issuers and the Users and in compliance with all applicable personal information retention laws. Individual Credentials and an User’s entire account may be deleted by the User at any time directly through the Service. Pearson will retain this Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may statistically aggregate in non-person-specific form information collected to improve our websites, our quality controls, operations management, security processes, future marketing and promotional efforts, and the overall Service in attempt to better understand our users’ interests and preferences. In some cases, we may transfer this information to our third-party service providers. By using this Site, you consent to this non-personally identifiable data aggregation and the use and transmission of this aggregated statistical data as outlined above.
How do we use your personal data?
ADDITIONAL USES OF SERVICE INFORMATION
In addition to the uses described above of the information received in connection with your use of the Service, Pearson uses and, where specified, shares your information:
To display Credentials.
Pearson may use your information to display Credentials that you receive through the Service or through Third-Party Services on the Pearson website or on third party websites or applications that you choose to share your personal information to.
To provide support or other services
that you have requested, and to respond to your inquiries.
To engage in transactions with you
, including contacting you about your account or transactions.
To notify you of relevant opportunities
such as new product releases and service developments, related facts or programming that may be relevant to you.
To improve quality and facilitate use of the Service.
To operate the Service through the assistance of third parties.
Pearson may use services from third-party service providers, such as hosting services and software developers, in support of its operation of the Service. When doing so, we will take steps to ensure that such service providers implement appropriate privacy and security measures consistent with this Privacy Policy to safeguard against the unauthorized use or disclosure of your information. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
To comply with legal requirements.
In addition, we may also disclose information about you as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights or protect our operations or users or others investigate fraud, or in response to legal processes or governmental investigations in accordance with our internal policy on access by governmental authorities, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.
Privacy Preferences
The Service allows you to customize the information about yourself that is made accessible to others. When you establish an account, the Service applies default settings. Default settings also apply to new features introduced on the Service. Credentials issued to you will default to the “public” setting. You may activate a “private” setting such that the Credential will no longer be publicly accessed at any time, on a Credential-by-Credential basis. Until you terminate your use of the Service, the fact that you are a user, as indicated by the public display of your full name and avatar, is available to others on the Service. Review your privacy settings regularly to ensure that they match your preferences.
Security
Pearson takes appropriate and reasonable precautions to implement appropriate administrative and technical procedures to protect the security of Personal Information provided or generated through the Service. We permit persons working for us to access and use your information only in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software or other encryption technology, which encrypts information you input. Wherever appropriate, we obfuscate and/or encrypt information in our systems and/or during information transfer. Pearson regularly reviews the cryptographic protocols it uses to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information.
Because of the nature of internet and for other reasons, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information, so you should take precautions to protect it when you are on the internet, such as changing passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, using a secure browser and being sure to log off the Service when finished using a shared computer.
Third-Party Sites
The Service may include hyperlinks to third-parties neither owned nor managed by us, and, as described above, you may use certain Third-Party Services in connection with the Credentials issued through the Service. Pearson has no control over these Third-Party Services and your interactions with those third parties are subject to their privacy policies and terms of use.
How long will you keep your personal data?
ACCESS, RETENTION AND DELETION
Upon request Pearson will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your account or contacting us at
privacy@credly.com
.  We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
Pearson may retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active and so long as retention is required or permitted in accordance with this Privacy Policy, or otherwise by law. When Pearson deletes your Personal Information, Pearson will do so in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed.
VIEWING OF DATA FOR SUPPORT
For the purpose of providing the Service and associated support including answering any questions you may have, Pearson may view and process your Personal Information from nations outside the EEA that are deemed by the EU to have non-adequate data protection laws, including the United States.
WHERE DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND HOW IS IT PROTECTED?
We take reasonable steps to protect your personal data from loss or destruction.
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal data, we will use procedures and security features consistent with industry practices to try to prevent unauthorized access.

Pearson will process your personal information pursuant to all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations. Pearson also believes that all data subjects have the following rights, including any additional rights granted by applicable legislation:

If applicable, we will provide you a list of the categories of Personal Information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the third parties' names and addresses.

These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
To comply with legal requirements.
In addition, we may also disclose information about you as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights or protect our operations or users or others investigate fraud, or in response to legal processes or governmental investigations in accordance with our internal policy on access by governmental authorities, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.
Privacy Preferences
The Service allows you to customize the information about yourself that is made accessible to others. When you establish an account, the Service applies default settings. Default settings also apply to new features introduced on the Service. Credentials issued to you will default to the “public” setting. You may activate a “private” setting such that the Credential will no longer be publicly accessed at any time, on a Credential-by-Credential basis. Until you terminate your use of the Service, the fact that you are a user, as indicated by the public display of your full name and avatar, is available to others on the Service. Review your privacy settings regularly to ensure that they match your preferences.
Security
Pearson takes appropriate and reasonable precautions to implement appropriate administrative and technical procedures to protect the security of Personal Information provided or generated through the Service. We permit persons working for us to access and use your information only in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software or other encryption technology, which encrypts information you input. Wherever appropriate, we obfuscate and/or encrypt information in our systems and/or during information transfer. Pearson regularly reviews the cryptographic protocols it uses to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information.
Because of the nature of internet and for other reasons, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information, so you should take precautions to protect it when you are on the internet, such as changing passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, using a secure browser and being sure to log off the Service when finished using a shared computer.
Third-Party Sites
The Service may include hyperlinks to third-parties neither owned nor managed by us, and, as described above, you may use certain Third-Party Services in connection with the Credentials issued through the Service. Pearson has no control over these Third-Party Services and your interactions with those third parties are subject to their privacy policies and terms of use.
How long will you keep your personal data?
ACCESS, RETENTION AND DELETION
Upon request Pearson will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your account or contacting us at
privacy@credly.com

Pearson may retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active and so long as retention is required or permitted in accordance with this Privacy Policy, or otherwise by law.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

https://www.openathens.net/privacy/:
OpenAthens is a Jisc enterprise. Jisc is a registered charity (in England and Wales under charity number 1149740; in Scotland under charity number SC053607) and a company limited by guarantee which is registered in England under Company No. 05747339, VAT No. GB 197 0632 86. Jisc’s registered office is: 4 Portwall Lane, Bristol, BS1 6NB. T 0203 697 5800. If you are a visitor to this website or an OpenAthens user, or if you represent an organization that uses OpenAthens, we want to explain how we respect your privacy. If you have any questions about this privacy notice or about your personal information, then please email
contact@openathens.net
.
We’ll use the information, as described in our standard privacy notice (at
https://www.jisc.ac.uk/website/privacy-notice
), to provide the OpenAthens service you’ve requested, as well as to identify problems or ways to make the service better. We’ll keep the information until we are told that you are no longer the nominated contact.
How have we got your information?
You may have given us your personal data yourself.
For example, you may have given us your business card at an event, emailed us requesting information, or filled in an online form so that you could download a report, document, or some other information.
We may have found your contact details at some publicly available source
but in this case, we wouldn’t use them without your consent.
The organization you work for may have given us your personal data
or asked you to give it to us because your role is key to the OpenAthens service or because you need to be an OpenAthens user.
If you visit our websites, we might use cookies and analytical tools to collect anonymous information about your visit.
Cookies are small text files placed on your computer to collect standard internet log and visitor behavior information. Tracking and analyzing visitor activity enables us to improve the website. For further information visit

What information do we collect?
If you are an OpenAthens user your organization
may have asked us to create an account for you. To do this we only need your name and email address. We encrypt this information so that we don’t disclose your identity to the publishers whose resources you need to access unless your organization asks us to do so. If your organization creates your account they will choose what information to collect and what information to disclose to publishers. This OpenAthens Privacy Notice can’t address that situation, you need to contact your organization’s OpenAthens administrator if you have any questions.
If you are the OpenAthens contact for your organization or someone who has expressed an interest in OpenAthens,
we only require your name, your role or job title, your department, the name of your organization, and your business contact details (phone numbers and email address).
Occasionally we might ask you for other personal information when we run an event or an online survey.
We’ll always make it clear why we’re collecting that information and how long we’ll keep it and of course, it will be up to you whether you want to participate in the event or survey.
What we do with your information
We only use your information in connection with the OpenAthens service.
We may contact you with news about OpenAthens
including changes and improvements to service and to tell you about any events or surveys that we’ll be running.
If you’re the nominated contact for your organization,
we may also need to use your personal data to process your purchase orders, invoices, and payments and to contact you about the service. This means we might need to share your personal data with some of our suppliers/service providers.
We’ll never sell your data. We might need to share it with third parties but only in connection with the OpenAthens service
– for example, if you are located outside the UK then one of our local partners may need to use your personal data so as to deliver some aspects of the OpenAthens service for us. Sometimes we’ll run communication campaigns using carefully selected marketing agencies to contact you on our behalf and so we’d have to give them your contact details. All third parties must give us contractual commitments to only use your information in connection with OpenAthens. If any of them want to put you on their own mailing lists, they need your specific agreement and they should let you review their own privacy policy.
If you’re an OpenAthens user and we were responsible for creating your account
, we anonymize your personal data when we deliver the OpenAthens service to you and we do not sell or share your personal data with any third party.
Contact us
for if you’d like details about any specific third party that we’re using.
How we protect your information
We adopt best industry practice to protect your information
by aligning with the international standards for information security such as ISO27017 and ISO27018 and we hold our own ISO27001 certification. We keep your personal information behind firewalls to prevent unauthorized access and it’s encrypted in transit.
OpenAthens uses the Google Cloud Platform.
Google adopts leading security measures and is certified to all the standards we’ve listed above. You can read more about their security measures here:

If you’re the nominated contact for your organization your information may also be kept in public or private clouds
used by the service providers we’ve selected for our finance systems. We only use service providers where we are happy with the security measures they implement to protect the data we entrust them with.
A
ll other third parties, wherever they are located,
who have to use your information in connection with the OpenAthens service must give us contractual commitments to adopt practices consistent with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation.
How long do we keep your information?
We’ll keep your personal information until you tell us not to.
You can unsubscribe at any time.
However, by law,
we must keep financial records such as purchase orders and invoices for six years. If you’re the nominated contact for your organization, your details might appear on these records. But apart from this, we keep your information until your organization tell us not to – for example when you stop working for them or because your job role has changed. In any case, we contact your organization every two years to check that your details are still valid. One year after your organization’s OpenAthens contract ends, we’ll contact you to see if you want us to delete your contact details or whether you’d like us to continue to send you OpenAthens news.
How you can check your information
We’re happy for you to check the information we have about you at any time.
You can ask us to tell you what information we have, why we have it, how we protect it etc. You can also check that your information’s accurate and we’ll make any corrections promptly. Similarly, we’ll delete your information if you ask us to.
Please note that if you’re an OpenAthens user or the nominated contact for your organization
, we’re obliged to check with them before we delete your information. This is because they are the data controller for your information and, for example, your organization might need us to substitute someone else’s contact details before we delete yours.
If you want to know about your information
please use the contact details shown at the top of this notice.
