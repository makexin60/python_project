Privacy Policy
Last modified: November 22, 2024
We’re so glad you’re here!
The How We Feel Project, Inc. (“How We Feel” or “HWF”) is a non-profit company. Our products include our iOS and Android apps, and our website (“Products”).
When we collect personal information in our Products, we collect it to help you track your emotions, spot patterns as they appear over time, learn new ways to keep yourself in the moment, and help you better understand your emotions. We do not sell your personal information, and we do not use it to sell ads or make money.
We built HWF with privacy in mind. You can use our Products without opening an account with us. If you do not open an account, the Check-In Data (defined below) you record in our Products will be stored locally on your iOS or Android device and HWF will not have access to that data unless you open an account later or choose to share your data with other users or researchers, as discussed in more detail below.
When you use our Products, you provide personal information to us. We wrote this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we use it and disclose it, how long we retain it, and what choices you have about it. Some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.
1.      Information We Collect
A.      Information You Provide Upon Opening An Account
When you open an account with HWF, we collect personal information that you provide to us (“Account Information”). If you open an account using a third-party login tool (e.g. Apple or Google), we will receive certain profile information about you from the third-party login tool provider. The profile information we receive may vary, but will often include your name, email address, as well as other information you choose to make public via that third-party account, such as a profile picture. If you add a profile picture manually, or edit your display name, we collect this information as part of your Account Information.
If you sign up via iOS, you have the option to hide your email address from us to enhance your privacy.
B.      Information We get When You Use Our Products
When you use our Products, we collect additional personal information based on your activity and other personal information you choose to provide. This includes:
Check-In Data
We collect the information you provide when you complete a Check-In on HWF (“Check-In Data”). Check-In Data may include the emotion you record, tags, journal entries, and other information you may choose to attach, such as photos or voice memos, or additional observations or reflections you add. It may also include location data if you choose to provide it. You can also choose to include information about your recent activities (sleep, exercise, meditation, steps, cycle), either by entering it manually or by connecting your HWF app to the Apple Health or Android Health Connect apps.
AI Features
We collect information you provide when you use our AI-powered features, like Reflect or Weekly review (“AI Features”) to help you think more about how you are feeling and why. AI Features are optional. For more information about AI Features and how we use your data in connection with them, please see the supplementary notice below.
Friends
You can add friends to your HWF account using an invite link or an invite code. Once you add friends, you can decide whether to share Check-In Data with your friends, and how much to share.

3.      How We Disclose The Information We Collect
We do not sell personal information about our users. We do not use personal information to sell ads, or make money. We may, however, disclose your personal information to:
Other Users
We may share your information with other users when you direct us to do so. The information we share will be limited to the information you instruct us to share.
Researchers
HWF partners with academic and other non-profit researchers who study emotional well being. If you authorize us to share your Check-In Data with researchers, we remove direct identifiers like your name or email address that would identify you in the research data. For more details please see the supplementary notice below.
Service providers and other third parties
We employ third parties to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including providers of services relating to product integrations, cloud computing, analytics, security, and user support. You can find a list of our service providers
here
.
Law enforcement, tax authorities, or governmental or non-governmental organizations
If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights or property of the public, any person; or to detect, prevent or otherwise address illegal conduct, fraud, security or technical issues, we may disclose information to law enforcement agencies, other governmental agencies, or private parties as needed.
Subsidiaries and affiliates
If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would disclose your information to parties involved in such a process (for example, a purchaser).
4.      How Long We Keep Information
We keep your information only so long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, which include providing our service, or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, or protecting or defending our rights, property and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't use it to identify you. We keep account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account.
If you delete User Content, we may retain a copy of it temporarily in storage, but will delete it from our backups within a reasonable amount of time.
5.      Managing Your Information
There are a variety of ways you can manage the personal information we have about you.

Other users' and employees' personal information, including the names and account information of individuals you may have interacted with in our Products, other users' feedback, and employees' comments because the information belongs to other individuals and disclosing it may impact their rights.
Internal proprietary attributes that enable us to provide various aspects of our app, because the information is protected by federal and state trade secret law.
