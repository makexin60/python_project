YOYO Limited Games Privacy Policy
Last Updated: September 7, 2024
This Privacy Policy explains who we are and as a data controller, how we handle your personal information (i.e.,
        collect, record, organize, structure, store, adapt or alter, retrieve, consult, use, disclose, transfer,
        disseminate, or otherwise make available, align, or combine, restrict, delete, or destroy), and how you can
        exercise your privacy rights. We are YOYO Games Limited, a developer and publisher of games and mobile gaming
        applications available through app stores, including the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This Privacy
        Policy applies to personal information we collect through our games, mobile applications, and other products
        ("games") collectively referred to as “services.” By using our services, you agree to be bound by this Privacy
        Policy and consent to our handling of your information as described herein.
1. Information We Collect From You
We collect most of the information about you directly from your interactions with our games or from third-party
        ads within our games or advertisements we place in other publishers' games. Generally, the information we
        collect about you relates to the type of device you're using, helping us identify your device and how you play
        our games, and may include information you voluntarily submit to contact us. We may also collect information
        from app store platforms, partners, and other third parties, such as your interests and in-app purchases
        (although we never receive your payment or credit card information).
The information we collect through the services generally falls into the following categories:
(a) Information You Provide Voluntarily
Certain parts of our services may require you to voluntarily provide personal information. For example, we may
        ask you for certain details to process an inquiry, such as:
•	Your name, email address, or other contact information necessary to address your inquiry;
•	Any information you submit to our support team via email.
We will try to explain why we need your personal information at the time we request it.
(b) Information We Collect Automatically
When you use our services, we may automatically collect certain information about you and/or your device in
        accordance with applicable data protection laws, such as:
• Information about how you use our services (e.g., in-game progress, levels completed, game session duration,
        settings preferences, in-game ads viewed, or game preferences).
• Your IP address and device identifiers (e.g., your advertising ID or device ID; for more information, see our
        section on advertising IDs and device IDs).
•	The type of device and operating system you are using.
•	Broad geographic location (e.g., country or city-level location based on your IP address).
•	Precise geographic location based on your IP address.
• Requesting your Write External Storage permissions (for example, we may collect documents, photos, and other
        information necessary for related functions to facilitate your normal use of the product features. However, our
        product will not currently collect and use other music files, audio files, videos, voice recordings, or other
        similar information).
Advertising IDs
refer to the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) on Apple and the Google
        Advertising ID (GAID) on Google devices. These are unique identifiers used by advertisers for personalized ads
        on mobile devices. They are present across all mobile apps, allowing for cross-app tracking. On Apple devices,
        you can opt out by selecting the "Limit Ad Tracking" option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can
        opt out by selecting the "Opt out of personalized ads" option. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal
        identifiers uniquely associated with your device.
Device Identifiers/Information
refer to the device type, device model, device manufacturer,
        device operating system, and its language or other technical data (e.g., screen size or processor), or a
        combination of such data obtained by developers from the device, used to check compatibility with specific
        applications.
Some of this information may be collected via cookies, as described in the "Cookies" section.
When a program crashes, the system automatically generates a crash log. We may collect these logs and use
        specialized tools to analyze them to identify the cause of the crash.
When diagnosing program or system issues, we collect relevant diagnostic data, including system status,
        application information, and application device performance. This data will be used to analyze the root cause of
        the problem and develop appropriate solutions.
(c) Information From Third-Party Sources
We may receive information about you from third-party social networks (e.g., Google Play Games, Apple Game
        Center, Facebook) and other partners or third parties.
Third-Party Social Networks:
You may choose to connect to our services via your social media
        account. The information we receive from your social media will depend on your privacy settings, but it
        generally includes your basic public profile information, such as your username, gender, and friends who are
        playing the same game. (See "Third-Party Social Networks" below for more details.)
Third-Party Service Providers:
We may receive your personal information from third-party
        sources. For example, we may obtain your personal information when you install our game and prior to
        installation, if you clicked on an advertisement for the same game.
Advertising Partners:
From time to time, we may also receive personal information from other
        third-party sources. For example, if you click on an advertisement that directs you to our services (such as an
        ad for one of our games shown in another publisher’s game), we will receive information about the ad network and
        the campaign from which the install originated (see "Advertising" below for more details).
(d) No Special Categories of Information
We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information,” such as personal data revealing
        racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership, genetic data,
        biometric data used to uniquely identify a person, data concerning health, or data concerning a person’s sex
        life or sexual orientation. Please exercise caution when sharing information about yourself (or others) on our
        forums.
2. How We Use Your Information

        subject to their respective terms. Please review the privacy policies and terms of service for Apple, Google,
        and Amazon.com stores.
3. How We Share Your Information
We cannot provide all the services necessary for the successful operation of our games by ourselves. Therefore,
        we must share the collected information with third parties to develop and provide our services, display
        advertisements, conduct analysis and research, and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns with
        our partners. We also reserve the right to disclose your information (including personal identification
        information) in the following circumstances: when required by law, in an anonymized manner, and in aggregate
        form that cannot be used to identify you.
We may share such information for the following purposes:
•
Our Analytics Providers:
We use third-party analytics, such as TapJoy, Unity, and Firebase,
        to provide our services and for analysis and research purposes. The data we share with these providers is
        encoded. The providers can assign a random ID, and they cannot match it back to you. We can aggregate data for
        benchmarking purposes.
•
Our Cloud Service Providers:
We store the information we collect from you with our
        third-party cloud service providers, such as iCloud and Google Cloud Platform.
•
Our Tracking and Fraud Prevention Vendors:
For some of our games, we use tracking and
        anti-fraud vendors, such as AppsFlyer and Tenjin, to measure performance and optimize our advertising campaigns,
        display ads, analyze to improve our services, and prevent fraud. These providers may use APIs and SDKs in our
        games to collect and analyze user and device-related data, including impressions, clicks, installs, or other
        performance metrics of advertising campaigns and in-app events post-installation.
•
Third-Party Advertising Partners:
We have contracts with certain third-party advertising
        networks to help us serve ads to you, enabling us to continue offering games for free or at a low cost.
•
Third-Party Tracking Vendors for Advertising Partners:
We allow our advertising partners to
        track impressions, clicks, installs, or other performance metrics of their advertising campaigns to measure
        their effectiveness. They may use their own third-party tracking vendors.
•
Other Third-Party Service Providers:
For our games, we use Unity software to develop such
        games. For information on Unity's data processing, please refer to Unity's privacy policy at
Unity Privacy Policy
.
        For certain games, we collaborate with third-party development studios. These third-party studios do not have
        access to your personal information; they only have access to aggregated data that cannot be traced back to you.
We may enter into contracts with other partners or change existing partners in the future to provide any
        services related to the games. These changes will be updated from time to time or promptly when there are
        significant changes in data processing practices.
We reserve the right to disclose your information (including personal identification information) in response to
        legal requests, legal processes, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or
        outside your country of residence. We may also disclose your information if we determine that it is necessary or
        appropriate for national security, law enforcement, or other public interest matters. Additionally, we may
        disclose your information if we determine that disclosure is necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to
        protect our operations, users, or user experience. Furthermore, in the event of a restructuring, merger, or
        sale, we may transfer any of our information (including personal identification information) collected to the
        relevant third parties.

4. Advertising
(a) General Information
We use advertisements to fund our services and provide our games for free.
We offer our games
        for free or at a low cost, and to achieve this, we need to share the information we collect from you with our
        third-party advertising partners. To protect your privacy, we only temporarily store personal information. The
        information we collect helps us improve our website and games while keeping our games free for a broad range of
        players.

If you are a user in the European Economic Area (EEA), please note:
When you use our games, we show ads to you based on our legitimate interests. The legal basis for displaying
        advertisements to EEA users is compliant with the legitimate interests outlined in Article 6(1)(f) of the
        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we work closely with our data protection officer. Additionally,
        we ensure that data processing agreements with external advertising technology providers comply with Article 28
        of the GDPR. We also ensure that our external service providers are committed to a high level of data protection
        through strict protection agreements.
Before sharing any information with our advertising partners for personalized advertising, we always seek your
        consent when you accept via the relevant button while loading the game. We allow our advertising partners to
        share your personal information for personalized advertising purposes only if you consent in the relevant pop-up
        window. Our advertising partners use different technologies to achieve personalized advertising, so please
        review their data processing practices before you accept personalized advertising when loading the game. The
        legal basis for showing personalized ads to users based in the EEA is based on Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.
        Additionally, we ensure compliance with Article 28 of the GDPR with our external advertising technology
        providers. We are committed to a high level of data protection for our external service providers. The goal is
        to improve our games and provide players with more relevant advertisements. You can choose to withdraw your
        consent to share your personal information for personalized advertising at any time. You can do this by going to
        the game settings and clicking the Terms & Privacy button in the section for withdrawing personalized
        advertising consent within the privacy policy. You can manage your preferences regarding the types of ads you
        wish to receive. When you decide to withdraw consent, or if you do not provide consent, you may still see the
        same number of ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they will not be based
        on your preferences, interests, behaviors, demographics, etc. Our advertising partners may continue to display
        ads based on the content of the applications you are using.
(b) In-Game Advertising (i.e., when you view ads within our games)
To enable us to display in-game ads, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with advertisers to help
        them find suitable ads to display to you in our games and third-party platforms. You can manage this in your
        device settings. We cannot control which specific ads are displayed in our games (this is controlled by the
        advertising platforms), but we do limit certain categories of ads.
Advertising platforms use Advertising IDs for various purposes (see the privacy statements of our advertising
        partners listed), including:
•	Limiting the number of times you see the same ad;
•	Ensuring they interact with real users on devices, rather than “automated” bots;
• Providing ads that are relevant to you (based on your Advertising ID and interactions with other brands), and
        recording ads based on your Advertising ID and general geographical location. Other brands purchase advertising
        space in our games through advertising platforms or ad exchanges. Advertising networks or ad exchanges act as
        intermediaries between other gaming companies and us. They track clicks on ads and potential installs of
        applications from other developers. The number of views, clicks, and installs of ads is measured using the
        advertising ID.
• Tracking similar games that you use for marketing purposes. Advertisers typically use IP addresses to
        understand your approximate geographical region (country, state, and sometimes at the city level).
(c) Viewing Our Ads on Third-Party Services
We also advertise our games through advertising networks in other applications to reach audiences interested in
        them (identified using Advertising IDs).
Advertising platforms use Advertising IDs for various purposes (see the privacy statements of our advertising
        partners listed), including:
• Measuring ad effectiveness (viewing the aggregate impressions, clicks, and installs generated through ads in
        other publishers' games);
• Informing players who have not played the game for some time about new content in the game. This is done
        through the advertising platform’s advertising ID. Then, the ad network displays ads about new content to these
        users;
• Not displaying ads in games where players are already playing. We can manage this through the ad network's
        advertising ID. The ad network will then prevent these players from seeing ads;
•	Promoting games to a group of potential players.
(d) Who Can Show You Personalized Ads?
Please refer to the list of advertising providers below that allow personalized advertising and review their
        data processing practices, including the technologies they use for personalized purposes.
(e) How to Opt Out of Personalized Advertising?
In addition to specific tools available for users in the EEA, you can use your device settings.
iOS
Open the "Settings" app on iOS, then select the "Privacy" menu item, and choose the "Advertising" sub-item. If
        you enable the "Limit Ad Tracking" option, we can only take limited measures, such as identifying unique users
        or combating fraud. In the same menu, you can always delete your IDFA (by selecting “Reset Ad-ID”), creating a
        new unmerged ID that will not use previously collected data.
Android
Open the "Settings" app and select the "Google" menu item. Depending on your device, this option may not be
        visible in the main menu, but you can find it using the search function at the top of the personal settings
        menu. From there, select the "Ads" sub-item and activate the option "Opt out of personalized ads" to prevent the
        creation of profiles and the display of personalized ads. You can also use the same menu (by selecting "Reset
        Advertising ID"), creating a new ID that will not merge with previously collected data.
5. Third-Party Social Networks
(a) Connecting to Third-Party Social Networks
Some of our games use third-party services, such as Google Play Games Services, Apple Game Center, and Facebook
        (referred to as "Third-Party Social Networks"). These games allow you to log in to your third-party social
        network accounts using the "Login" feature in our application. You can also share content created within the
        application on these third-party social networks. Please note that third-party social networks are governed by
        their own privacy policies, terms, and end-user agreements, for which we are not responsible and cannot control
        the sharing practices or policies of the parties operating those sites. For any other questions, please contact
        us at
yoyogames.studio@gmail.com
.
(b) Information We May Receive When You Connect to Third-Party Social Networks
The information you allow us to access varies by application and is subject to the privacy settings you have
        established on these third-party social networks. You can control and learn more about these settings from the
        respective third-party social networks. When you use the "Login" feature, we may access and store some or all of
        the following information, as permitted by you, the third-party social network, and your preferences: (i) basic
        information from your public profile, such as your nickname and profile picture; (ii) login ID and/or player
        identifier string; (iii) your friend list; (iv) notifications displayed during the "Login" process. We may share
        your name and game data (such as steps, game progress, and scores) with applicable applications, friends who
        also use the "Login" feature, or with contacts related to the "Connect to" feature within the applicable
        third-party social media network accounts.
The application may further request your permission to disclose information on your behalf to these third-party
        social networks (such as status updates). Please remember that we will only do this with your explicit consent
        and will store your ID and full name for user identification purposes. Other information will only be stored
        within the application on your device to allow the application to communicate directly with the third-party
        social networks.
(c) How You Share Your Information with Third-Party Social Networks
If you engage in game-related activities (such as leaderboards and multiplayer games) using third-party social
        networks, you share your information (for example, scores, rankings, and achievements) with other players and
        the third-party social networks.
