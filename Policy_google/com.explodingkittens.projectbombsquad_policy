February 17, 2025
Previous Version:
Privacy Policy 2023
Welcome
This
Privacy Policy
(“
Policy
”) explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your personal information through our services. Exploding Kittens, Inc. is the data controller of the personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service (“
Terms
”). Exploding Kittens, Inc. is referred to in this Policy as “
EK
”, “
we
”, “
our
” or “
us
”.
How we handle your information depends on which services you use, and how you use them. This Policy is grouped into these sections:
about us and this Policy
;
information we collect & why we use it
;
information disclosed to others
;
how to control your privacy
; and
information about local privacy laws
.
We encourage you to read this Policy carefully. If you have questions, please
contact us
.
About Us And This Policy
This Policy is designed to explain how we process your personal information and how you can exercise control over our processing. Capitalized terms that are used but not defined in this Policy are defined in our Terms. The Terms describe how the Services works in general, and establish a contract between you and us governing your use of the Services.
Contact us
If you have any questions or feedback about this Policy, email us at
privacy@explodingkittens.com
or write to us at:

Changes to this Policy
Because the Services change often, this Policy may change over time. Anytime we modify the Policy, we will post a revised version on the Services as noted at
Last Updated
above. If we intend to use your personal information in a way that is materially different from the ways described at the time of collection, we will notify you before the material changes to this Policy take effect, so you have time to review them. If we have your contact information (such as your email or phone number), we will notify you that way. We may also post a temporary notice on the Services, or notify you by other means to the extent required by law.
Check the
Last Updated
date periodically to ensure you’re aware of the current Policy. By using or accessing the Services, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy and the Terms.
When this Policy applies
This Policy applies to you when you use the Services, effective as of the
Last Updated
date. However, some collection and use of information falls outside this Policy:
Outside services
: Outside Materials (as defined in our Terms) are not part of the Services, so this Policy doesn’t apply to any information you may exchange with providers of Outside Materials or other third parties. If you follow a link to a third-party website, your use of that website is governed by that website’s privacy policy, and is not covered by this Policy.
Our personnel
: If you are a current or former employee or contractor of ours, this Policy does not apply to you. Reach out to your human-resources partner or supervisor with any inquiries about your personal information at
privacy@explodingkittens.com
When we don’t control your information
: If we receive your information in our role as a service provider to another business, our agreement with that business governs our use of your information. We will refer any questions or concerns of yours to that business.
Information We Collect & Why We Use It
We collect certain information when you use the services. This includes information you provide through the services, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources. This also includes information you may provide to third-party service providers while using our services.
This section describes, comprehensively, how the services collect and use your information, and our legal basis for that processing. Under certain data protection laws like GDPR, companies must have a “legal basis”—a valid reason—to process personal information. We rely on different legal bases to process your information for the purposes described in this Policy.

Google API Service User Data Policy,
including its Limited Use requirements.
Security
EK has implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Still, no data transmission online is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you provide, and you provide it at your own risk.
We cannot promise that your information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we may provide.
Information Disclosed To Others
This section describes how and why we exchange personal information with contractors and third parties. It also describes exchanges made for certain purposes, like advertising, legal reasons and consensual direct marketing. We may also disclose deidentified and aggregate data for these purposes.
Direct marketing
We will only disclose your contact information to third parties for direct marketing purposes if you opt-in, and will only do so until you opt-out. We may share information about you with third party sponsors or partners who will use it for marketing purposes but only if you opt in to such sharing or do not opt out when prompted. We will never share information in this manner without giving you one of these two options.
For personalized ads
We share information with advertising partners to make the advertising presented to you more relevant to you. We also market the Services to you through ads facilitated by marketing vendors.
For example, we use AdRoll to serve ads on the Services and we market the Services to you on third party services. AdRoll uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on your visits to our webpages and to other sites. You can opt out of the use of the AdRoll cookie by visiting its
Opt-Out page
.
We try to limit how third-party advertising technology vendors use information they collect from you. Most providers require us to enter contracts that allow them to optimize their ad services and products. Essentially, they combine any information they may gather about you through our Services with information they receive from their other clients. This helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.
In the past twelve months, we have shared these categories of personal information with third parties to personalize advertising:
Device Information (including Personal Identifiers)
Commercial Information
Internet Activity
Geolocation
With our Affiliates
We may share, link or pool user information among affiliates and business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services, but always in accordance with applicable law, applicable agreements and this Policy.
Functional disclosures
In addition to the use of trackers, cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags described in our
Cookie Policy
, we contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services related to the functionality and features of the Services, including payment processing, shipping and fulfillment, data management, and administration of promotions. We refer to them as “contractors.”
We may disclose information about you, such as personal identifiers, Commercial Information, Activity Data, and Device Information, to contractors as necessary for them to perform their services. Contractors are not permitted to use information about you for any other purpose. In the past twelve (12) months, we have disclosed these types of information to the following types of contractors:
Analytics providers, namely Microsoft Clarity, Facebook Connect, TikTok Analytics, and MNTN to tell us how the Services is doing, such as which parts interest visitors and how long they visit before leaving. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.
Various hosting services and data processors to provide the infrastructure of the Services, such as Cloudfront, which ensures that traffic is from real people, not computers. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.
Privacy providers, namely AdRoll CMP, to manage your data-collection preferences on the Services. Among other data, to set your preferences, they will receive your IP address.
Payment providers, namely ShopPay, PayPal, Google Pay, and Venmo, to process payments between you and us, such as for subscriptions or products. These providers receive information about your order in order to tie your payment process to your order. We don’t receive all of the information you may provide to them as part of that process (for instance, we don’t receive full payment-account numbers).
Support providers, namely Gorgias, to provide assistance to you when you request it. They are able to retrieve information about you that is relevant and necessary to your requests, such as account information and order details.
With your consent or at your request
We may periodically ask for your consent to disclose your information to third parties. Whenever we ask your consent for this reason, we will summarize the purpose and scope of the disclosure. For example, we may offer discounts to you if you consent to join our mailing list or participate in a promotion involving direct marketing communications.
In those cases, the Services will display a tickbox near an email-entry field explaining that by submitting your information, you agree to share your email with the content provider.
To be clear, we only exchange information about you with third parties for direct marketing purposes if you opt-in, and will only do so until you opt-out.
For legal reasons
Finally, we may disclose personal information:
In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us;
When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms and other agreements; or
In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
How Long We Retain Your Information
We retain your information only as long as we need it for the purposes described under ‘
Information we collect & how we use it
’, except when longer retention is required by our compliance policies and efforts toward applicable legal, tax, accounting and regulatory requirements.
How long we need information for those purposes varies by category, and even within categories. These retention determinations always consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from its unauthorized use or disclosure, whether we can achieve those purposes without using the personal information.
For example, we delete some Activity Data as soon as you exit the Services, whereas we may retain records of your orders for products for several years as required by law or contract, such as agreements with our payment processors or under our accounting standards.
Use By Minors
The Services are intended for people 16 and older. If you are between 13 and 15 years of age, you are only permitted to use the Services with your parent or guardian’s prior consent. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13, and we do not share or sell information about anyone under 13 without affirmative authorization. If we learn that we have collected information from a person under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you are under 13: We’re sorry, but please stop using the Services. If you’ve already sent us information, please
contact us
first so we can delete it.
If you are a parent or guardian of a person under 16 years of age who provided information to us without your prior consent, please
contact us
so we can delete it.
How To Control Your Privacy

Requesting information
’ to exercise your rights. These rights are provided only to human account holders, and are not available to employers or other legal entities, except as required by law.

Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
form to opt out of the sale or share of your personal data.
International Data Transfers
If you reside outside the United States, we transfer information about you for processing in the United States
. By providing your information to us, you consent to the processing of the information in the United States. The transfer of this information to the United States is necessary for the performance of our contract for use of the Services.
When we transfer personal data subject to GDPR outside of the EU, we use standard contract clauses approved by the EU for this purpose, or another appropriate transfer mechanism.
Note that U.S. law is not equivalent to laws in other countries, such as GDPR in Europe or PIPEDA in Canada. As of the
Last Updated
date, the U.S. has not been deemed an ‘adequate’ jurisdiction under GDPR for the purposes of international data transfers. However, the EU and the U.S. are negotiating the terms of an adequacy determination that may go into effect in the years to come.
Information About Local Privacy Laws
The Services operates from the United States, but this Policy applies worldwide. Our practices generally do not differ based on your location, but your rights and choices depend in part on the law where you live.
If any of these local privacy laws apply to you, that section override any contrary descriptions elsewhere in the Policy as they relate to you. If you have questions about your rights under other data privacy laws, please
contact us
.
Requesting information
Submitting requests
To exercise any rights described in this Policy, please
contact us
. Your request must:
provide sufficient information to identify you and the law that applies to you, such as your name, e-mail address, home or work address, or other information we maintain.
not include social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, third-party account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, or health information.
Verifying requests
We verify requests by first confirming the source of the request and then by matching the information submitted to the information we maintain. If your request is unclear or we are unable to authenticate your identity, we will respond with direction on how to remedy the deficiencies, in accordance with law that applies to you.
If we cannot verify the identity of the individual making the request, we may deny it, in full or in part.
Responses to requests
We will respond to your request as quickly as we can, taking into account the nature of your request and the volume of pending requests. The content of our response will vary with the nature of your request, but will always respond in accordance with any deadlines or requirements specified by the laws that apply to you.
Under certain circumstances, we may be unable to provide responsive personal information, such as when disclosure would create a substantial, articulable and unreasonable risk to the security of the information, customers’ account with us, or the security of our systems or networks. We do not disclose account passwords or any other non-personal information that enables access to an account.
Please understand, however, that we reserve the right to retain an archive of any deleted information, to the extent permitted by law. We may also retain deidentified or aggregate data derived from information about you.
Appealing decisions
Residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia and other jurisdictions that provide for an appeal mechanism may appeal a decision we have made regarding their requests by
contacting us.

We also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request. If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on a user’s behalf (where permitted), we may require proof of your written authorization before processing the request. Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request.

PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated
:
February 17, 2025
Previous Version:
Privacy Policy 2023
Welcome
This
Privacy Policy
(“
Policy
”) explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your personal information through our services. Exploding Kittens, Inc. is the data controller of the personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service (“
Terms
”). Exploding Kittens, Inc. is referred to in this Policy as “
EK
”, “
we
”, “
our
” or “
us
”.
How we handle your information depends on which services you use, and how you use them. This Policy is grouped into these sections:
about us and this Policy
;
information we collect & why we use it
;
information disclosed to others
;
how to control your privacy
; and
information about local privacy laws
.
We encourage you to read this Policy carefully. If you have questions, please
contact us
.
About Us And This Policy
This Policy is designed to explain how we process your personal information and how you can exercise control over our processing. Capitalized terms that are used but not defined in this Policy are defined in our Terms. The Terms describe how the Services works in general, and establish a contract between you and us governing your use of the Services.
Contact us
If you have any questions or feedback about this Policy, email us at
privacy@explodingkittens.com
or write to us at:

USA
Changes to this Policy
Because the Services change often, this Policy may change over time. Anytime we modify the Policy, we will post a revised version on the Services as noted at
Last Updated
above. If we intend to use your personal information in a way that is materially different from the ways described at the time of collection, we will notify you before the material changes to this Policy take effect, so you have time to review them. If we have your contact information (such as your email or phone number), we will notify you that way. We may also post a temporary notice on the Services, or notify you by other means to the extent required by law.
Check the
Last Updated
date periodically to ensure you’re aware of the current Policy. By using or accessing the Services, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy and the Terms.
When this Policy applies
This Policy applies to you when you use the Services, effective as of the
Last Updated
date. However, some collection and use of information falls outside this Policy:
Outside services
: Outside Materials (as defined in our Terms) are not part of the Services, so this Policy doesn’t apply to any information you may exchange with providers of Outside Materials or other third parties. If you follow a link to a third-party website, your use of that website is governed by that website’s privacy policy, and is not covered by this Policy.
Our personnel
: If you are a current or former employee or contractor of ours, this Policy does not apply to you. Reach out to your human-resources partner or supervisor with any inquiries about your personal information at
privacy@explodingkittens.com
When we don’t control your information
: If we receive your information in our role as a service provider to another business, our agreement with that business governs our use of your information. We will refer any questions or concerns of yours to that business.
Information We Collect & Why We Use It
We collect certain information when you use the services. This includes information you provide through the services, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources. This also includes information you may provide to third-party service providers while using our services.
This section describes, comprehensively, how the services collect and use your information, and our legal basis for that processing. Under certain data protection laws like GDPR, companies must have a “legal basis”—a valid reason—to process personal information. We rely on different legal bases to process your information for the purposes described in this Policy.

Any personal information that EK obtains from other third-party sources will be processed by EK in accordance with this Policy and all applicable laws. For example, our use and transfer of information via Google APIs will adhere to the
Google API Service User Data Policy,
including its Limited Use requirements.
Security
EK has implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Still, no data transmission online is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you provide, and you provide it at your own risk.
We cannot promise that your information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we may provide.
Information Disclosed To Others
This section describes how and why we exchange personal information with contractors and third parties. It also describes exchanges made for certain purposes, like advertising, legal reasons and consensual direct marketing. We may also disclose deidentified and aggregate data for these purposes.
Direct marketing
We will only disclose your contact information to third parties for direct marketing purposes if you opt-in, and will only do so until you opt-out. We may share information about you with third party sponsors or partners who will use it for marketing purposes but only if you opt in to such sharing or do not opt out when prompted. We will never share information in this manner without giving you one of these two options.
For personalized ads
We share information with advertising partners to make the advertising presented to you more relevant to you. We also market the Services to you through ads facilitated by marketing vendors.
For example, we use AdRoll to serve ads on the Services and we market the Services to you on third party services. AdRoll uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on your visits to our webpages and to other sites. You can opt out of the use of the AdRoll cookie by visiting its
Opt-Out page
.
We try to limit how third-party advertising technology vendors use information they collect from you. Most providers require us to enter contracts that allow them to optimize their ad services and products. Essentially, they combine any information they may gather about you through our Services with information they receive from their other clients. This helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.
In the past twelve months, we have shared these categories of personal information with third parties to personalize advertising:
Device Information (including Personal Identifiers)
Commercial Information
Internet Activity
Geolocation
With our Affiliates
We may share, link or pool user information among affiliates and business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services, but always in accordance with applicable law, applicable agreements and this Policy.
Functional disclosures
In addition to the use of trackers, cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags described in our
Cookie Policy
, we contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services related to the functionality and features of the Services, including payment processing, shipping and fulfillment, data management, and administration of promotions. We refer to them as “contractors.”
We may disclose information about you, such as personal identifiers, Commercial Information, Activity Data, and Device Information, to contractors as necessary for them to perform their services. Contractors are not permitted to use information about you for any other purpose. In the past twelve (12) months, we have disclosed these types of information to the following types of contractors:
Analytics providers, namely Microsoft Clarity, Facebook Connect, TikTok Analytics, and MNTN to tell us how the Services is doing, such as which parts interest visitors and how long they visit before leaving. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.
Various hosting services and data processors to provide the infrastructure of the Services, such as Cloudfront, which ensures that traffic is from real people, not computers. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.
Privacy providers, namely AdRoll CMP, to manage your data-collection preferences on the Services. Among other data, to set your preferences, they will receive your IP address.
Payment providers, namely ShopPay, PayPal, Google Pay, and Venmo, to process payments between you and us, such as for subscriptions or products. These providers receive information about your order in order to tie your payment process to your order. We don’t receive all of the information you may provide to them as part of that process (for instance, we don’t receive full payment-account numbers).
Support providers, namely Gorgias, to provide assistance to you when you request it. They are able to retrieve information about you that is relevant and necessary to your requests, such as account information and order details.
With your consent or at your request
We may periodically ask for your consent to disclose your information to third parties. Whenever we ask your consent for this reason, we will summarize the purpose and scope of the disclosure. For example, we may offer discounts to you if you consent to join our mailing list or participate in a promotion involving direct marketing communications.
In those cases, the Services will display a tickbox near an email-entry field explaining that by submitting your information, you agree to share your email with the content provider.
To be clear, we only exchange information about you with third parties for direct marketing purposes if you opt-in, and will only do so until you opt-out.
For legal reasons
Finally, we may disclose personal information:
In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us;
When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms and other agreements; or
In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
How Long We Retain Your Information
We retain your information only as long as we need it for the purposes described under ‘
Information we collect & how we use it
’, except when longer retention is required by our compliance policies and efforts toward applicable legal, tax, accounting and regulatory requirements.
How long we need information for those purposes varies by category, and even within categories. These retention determinations always consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from its unauthorized use or disclosure, whether we can achieve those purposes without using the personal information.
For example, we delete some Activity Data as soon as you exit the Services, whereas we may retain records of your orders for products for several years as required by law or contract, such as agreements with our payment processors or under our accounting standards.
Use By Minors
The Services are intended for people 16 and older. If you are between 13 and 15 years of age, you are only permitted to use the Services with your parent or guardian’s prior consent. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13, and we do not share or sell information about anyone under 13 without affirmative authorization. If we learn that we have collected information from a person under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you are under 13: We’re sorry, but please stop using the Services. If you’ve already sent us information, please
contact us
first so we can delete it.
If you are a parent or guardian of a person under 16 years of age who provided information to us without your prior consent, please
contact us
so we can delete it.
How To Control Your Privacy

As a user of the Services, you have rights and choices about your personal information. We want you to be in control of your information, so we want to remind you of the following options and tools available to you:
Account controls

Marketing opt-outs
: You may opt out of any newsletters or promotional communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions in the communication you receive.

SMS Terms
for more information.

Exercising rights
: If any of the local privacy laws listed below apply to you, see ‘
Requesting information
’ to exercise your rights. These rights are provided only to human account holders, and are not available to employers or other legal entities, except as required by law.
Personalized ads
: In addition to any choices the Services offer you, there are several ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, typically in the settings or preferences area. See your browser's help function or support area to learn more.

DAA Webchoices Browser Check
and
NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising
. You can download the
AppChoices
app to opt out in mobile apps.
“Do Not Track.”
: Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. However, you may use our
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
form to opt out of the sale or share of your personal data.
International Data Transfers
If you reside outside the United States, we transfer information about you for processing in the United States
. By providing your information to us, you consent to the processing of the information in the United States. The transfer of this information to the United States is necessary for the performance of our contract for use of the Services.
When we transfer personal data subject to GDPR outside of the EU, we use standard contract clauses approved by the EU for this purpose, or another appropriate transfer mechanism.
Note that U.S. law is not equivalent to laws in other countries, such as GDPR in Europe or PIPEDA in Canada. As of the
Last Updated
date, the U.S. has not been deemed an ‘adequate’ jurisdiction under GDPR for the purposes of international data transfers. However, the EU and the U.S. are negotiating the terms of an adequacy determination that may go into effect in the years to come.
Information About Local Privacy Laws
The Services operates from the United States, but this Policy applies worldwide. Our practices generally do not differ based on your location, but your rights and choices depend in part on the law where you live.
If any of these local privacy laws apply to you, that section override any contrary descriptions elsewhere in the Policy as they relate to you. If you have questions about your rights under other data privacy laws, please
contact us
.
Requesting information
Submitting requests
To exercise any rights described in this Policy, please
contact us
. Your request must:
provide sufficient information to identify you and the law that applies to you, such as your name, e-mail address, home or work address, or other information we maintain.
not include social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, third-party account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, or health information.
Verifying requests
We verify requests by first confirming the source of the request and then by matching the information submitted to the information we maintain. If your request is unclear or we are unable to authenticate your identity, we will respond with direction on how to remedy the deficiencies, in accordance with law that applies to you.
If we cannot verify the identity of the individual making the request, we may deny it, in full or in part.
Responses to requests
We will respond to your request as quickly as we can, taking into account the nature of your request and the volume of pending requests. The content of our response will vary with the nature of your request, but will always respond in accordance with any deadlines or requirements specified by the laws that apply to you.
Under certain circumstances, we may be unable to provide responsive personal information, such as when disclosure would create a substantial, articulable and unreasonable risk to the security of the information, customers’ account with us, or the security of our systems or networks. We do not disclose account passwords or any other non-personal information that enables access to an account.
Please understand, however, that we reserve the right to retain an archive of any deleted information, to the extent permitted by law. We may also retain deidentified or aggregate data derived from information about you.
Appealing decisions
Residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia and other jurisdictions that provide for an appeal mechanism may appeal a decision we have made regarding their requests by
contacting us.
Information for Users in Certain U.S. States
Exercising your rights: As described in the ‘
How to control your privacy
’ section of the Policy, all our users have control over their information and can limit what data we process.

Certain information may be exempt from the requests above under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you. We also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request. If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on a user’s behalf (where permitted), we may require proof of your written authorization before processing the request. Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request.
If you have any questions about these rights, wish to exercise them, or request an appeal, please

Additional Information for Users in California
In addition to the rights described above, consumers residing in California are afforded the right to certain additional information with respect to their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). If you are a California resident, this section applies to you.

We collect the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as your username, the email address you used to sign up, and your phone number if you’ve chosen to provide it); commercial information (a record of what you’ve bought from EK, if anything); financial data (payment information and your history of purchases from EK); internet or other network information (how you interact with the services); location information (because your IP address may indicate your general location); inference data about you (for example, what content you may be interested in); and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. For more information about what we collect and the sources of such collection, please see the ‘
Information we collect & why we process it
’ section of the Privacy Policy. To the extent we collect or use sensitive personal information as defined by law (such as the CCPA), we do so in accordance with applicable legal requirements, and we do not use or disclose it other than for purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.

We retain personal information as described in the ‘
How long we retain your information

California’s “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties, as defined under applicable law, for their direct marketing purposes. We only share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes with your consent and, if you have consented, only until you withdraw your consent.

Terms of Service
Last Update:
February 17, 2025
Previous Version(s):
Terms of Service 2023
,
Terms of Service 2022
Important
: These Terms require all disputes between us to go through binding arbitration instead of government court. By accepting these Terms, you waive any right to have disputes decided (1) by a judge or jury and (2) in class or representative actions. You can opt-out of arbitration for thirty (30) days after you first accept these Terms—see
opt-out
under
Dispute Resolution
below.
We provide italicized digests like this to guide you through these Terms—but only the text of those sections, not the digests, are part of the Terms.
Introduction
This is a contract between you and us. You can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. If you do not understand or agree to these Terms, don't use the Services.
These Terms of Service (“
Terms
”) form a legal agreement between you and Exploding Kittens, Inc. (“
EK
”, “
we
”, “
us
”, “
our
”, as appropriate) that applies when you use our Services.
In these Terms, “
you
” and “
your
” means you as the user of the Services. “
Services
” means explodingkittens.com and our other websites (“
Sites
”), Products (defined below), software or other services we make available via our Sites including, but not limited to, Mobile Messaging (defined below).
By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our
Privacy Policy
(together, the “
Agreement
”).
Read this Agreement carefully before you accept it. We’ve tried to be straightforward in our Terms and if you have any questions feel free to send us a note at
legal@explodingkittens.com
(our “
Support Email Address
”).
If you do not accept or understand anything in the Agreement, stop using the Services.
Updates
As the Services change, we may update the Terms by posting a new version and updating the Last Update date above. You are responsible for ensuring that you remain aware of the current Terms.
As the Services change, we’ll update these Terms by posting a new version and changing the Last Update date. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least 14 days’ notice before any material changes go into effect. The prior version will remain accessible at a link just below it. We may notify the email the address in your account or place a temporary notice on the Services, but it’s your responsibility to review these Terms from time to time for updates.
However, it is your responsibility to ensure that you remain aware of the current Terms and comply with them. By using or accessing the Services after the Last Update date, you accept the current Terms. If you do not accept a change to the Terms, you can’t use the Services.
Outside Materials
The third-party content and features we embed and link to are subject to the third party’s contractual terms and policies.
The Services may embed, link or utilize third-party websites or resources. We provide these outside materials as a convenience and are not responsible for nor do we endorse the content, products or services on or available from those websites or resources or links displayed on such websites (“
Outside Materials
”). Outside Materials may be subject to additional legal terms (“
Outside Terms
”) made available by their third-party provider.
For example, by accessing or downloading an EK-branded digital game from the Apple App Store, you are agreeing to
Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement
.
Also, your use of any digital game is subject to the Outside Terms of that game’s developer (for instance, the official Exploding Kittens® mobile app was developed by Marmalade Game Studio and is subject to its
App Terms of Use
).
The Agreement does not apply to Outside Materials. We are also not a party to Outside Terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for, and disclaim all liability for, the performance and reliability of Outside Materials and any act or omission of any provider of Outside Materials. We do not warrant, endorse or otherwise guarantee the Outside Materials’ integration, interoperation or support with the Services.
If you have any complaints in connection with any Outside Materials or Outside Terms, please contact the third-party provider directly, your state Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission at
www.ftc.gov
.

We may, in our sole discretion, remove, edit or disable any User Content at any time and for any reason, including if we determine that the User Content violates the Terms. You agree that User Content may be viewed by other users who, notwithstanding these Terms, may share that User Content with third parties.
Responsibility for Content or User Content

We do not pre-screen or review any User Content (though we reserve the right to in the future) and do not approve or endorse any User Content that may be available on the Services or other EK offerings. You are prohibited from copying other individuals’ User Content or using it for commercial purposes or to spam, harass, or make unlawful threats.

Retail Purchases
a.
Online Purchases
. The Services allow you to buy physical or digital products (“
Products
”). While we try to maintain the accuracy of the Services, we are not responsible or liable if any Product description or other information is not accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to:
reprice or discontinue any Product for any reason at any time;
limit the sale or availability of Products in any area or jurisdiction;
limit quantities of Products available per order, household or user, or cancel orders in excess of those quantities;
refuse or cancel any order for any reason (e.g. orders that appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors).
We will use all reasonable endeavors to ensure that the Services display the correct availability of Products for ordering, such as identifying temporarily out of stock Products. If a Product is not as described on the Services, your sole remedy is to return it (for physical Products, in unused condition) as described in
Returns & Refunds
in our
Help Center
.
b.
Online Sales & Payment
. When you make a purchase, we will charge the payment method selected by you and approved by us for the price of the applicable Products purchased as well as certain fees, including, but not limited to applicable shipping fees (which will be disclosed to you prior to purchase) and sales, use or other taxes (each, a “
Transaction
”). All amounts are payable and charged at the time your order is placed. You expressly authorize us and our third-party payment processors— ShopPay, PayPal, Google Pay, and Venmo as of the Last Update— to charge you for such Transactions.
We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including your credit card number and expiration date, email and postal addresses for billing and notification, and information to verify your identity (such information, “
Payment Information
”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete your Transaction and to charge your payment method for the type of Transaction you have selected.
By initiating a Transaction, you agree to the applicable pricing, payment and billing policies in this Agreement and as posted or otherwise communicated to you. All amounts and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars. Title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of the Products to a common carrier.
c.
Delivery
. Products will be delivered to the address specified in your order and in accordance with the delivery option you selected at the point of checkout. We will also notify you of the places where we can or cannot ship physical Products. While we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your order is dispatched and delivered on time, please be aware that dispatch and delivery times are estimates only, and that time of dispatch or delivery is not of the essence of any Transaction.
We may defer the date of dispatch or delivery or cancel any Transaction, or remove from your order any Products ordered by you (without liability) in the event of unforeseen circumstances or events beyond our reasonable control.
We reserve the right to ship your order in installments should some components of your order be unavailable for delivery, or have delayed availability, when you place your order, or if your order is too big to deliver in one shipment. We will notify you of any delays on shipment that will exceed thirty (30) days from your payment and we will either provide substitute Products or offer a full refund, as indicated by law.
d.
Cancellations and Returns
. We hope that you will be happy with all Products purchased from the Site, however, if you are not, you have the right to change your mind and cancel the Transaction at any time before shipment and within 30 days after shipment, in accordance with our
Return Policy
.
EU and UK consumers only: Under local law, you are entitled to a 14-day refund period. This refund period commences when the Products are in your possession or an authorized third party’s possession. If the last day of this 14-day period lands on a public holiday, Saturday or Sunday, the period will extend to the end of the next business day. Please contact
support@explodingkittens.com
if applicable law in your jurisdiction entitles you to a refund.
For digital Products, no matter where the customer resides, the return period ends when you begin to use the Product (e.g., begin to download, play, stream, or otherwise use it).
e.
Promotional Codes
. We may offer certain promotional, referral, discount, and coupon codes or similar offers (“
Promos
”) that may be redeemed for discounts on future Products or other features related to the Services, subject to any additional terms we establish. You agree that Promos: (i) must be used in a lawful manner; (ii) must be used for the intended audience and purpose; (iii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available by you to the general public (whether posted to a public forum, coupon collecting service, or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by us; (iv) may be disabled or have additional conditions applied to them by us at any time for any reason; (v) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that we establish; (vi) are not valid for cash or other credits or points; (vii) may expire prior to your use; (vii) are not valid on previous purchases. Promos may not be valid on certain items (like bundled, sale, markdown items).
f.
App Store Purchases
. Depending on the Product, you may be able to purchase it through your device’s native app store or another third-party provider (collectively, “
App Store
”). If you buy a Product through an App Store, such as with your Apple ID or Google Play account (your “
External Account
”), your External Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to that External Account.
Termination, Liability & Indemnity
Disclaimers
We don’t make any guarantees about the Services.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EK EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY LAW, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. EK makes no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. EK makes no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of the Services. Use of the Services and the transmission of communications through the Services is done at your own discretion and risk.
These limitations apply only to the extent they are not prohibited by applicable law. To the extent permissible, any implied warranties that cannot be excluded are limited to ninety (90) days, or such longer period as applicable law requires.
Limitation Of Liability
This section limits what you can recover from us in a dispute.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EK AND ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS (the “Exploding Kittens Parties”) WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY:
LOSS OF PROFITS,
LOST REVENUE,
LOST SAVINGS,
LOSS OF DATA,
OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES,
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, OR THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE OR LACK OF FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF ONE OF THE EXPLODING KITTENS PARTIES’ FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE AND EVEN IF THE EXPLODING KITTENS PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
FURTHER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE EXPLODING KITTENS PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMS OR THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED: (A) THE TOTAL AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID (IF ANY) OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO US FOR THE PARTICULAR SERVICE(S) IN QUESTION DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; OR (B) IF (A) DOES NOT APPLY, FIFTY DOLLARS ($50 USD). THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS REGARDING DAMAGES APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, some countries, states, provinces or other jurisdictions do not allow a limitation of liability as stated above and, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing exclusions and limitations will apply to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in the Terms will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services.
Indemnity
If someone sues us based on your breach of the Terms or your access/use of the Services, you agree to defend us or pay for our defense in that lawsuit.
You agree to indemnify (in other words, compensate for all and any losses incurred), pay the defense costs of, and hold the Exploding Kittens Parties and their agents, contractors, and other representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert witnesses’ fees) that arise out of or in any way are connected with: (a) your access to or use of the Services; or (b) any claim that, if true, would constitute a breach by you of the Terms. You agree to reimburse us for any payments made or loss suffered by us, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this 'Indemnity' section.
In the event of such a claim, suit, or action, we will notify you using the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations under this Agreement). This obligation will survive any suspension, termination or cessation of your use of the Services.
Termination
We may terminate your access to or account with the Services at any time, for any reason.
To the fullest extent consistent with applicable law, we may suspend, modify or terminate your access to and use of the Services with no liability or notice to you in the event that (a) you breach any terms of the Terms; or (b) we otherwise deem it necessary to suspend or modify your access to and use of the Services or terminate the Terms in our sole discretion. A suspension or modification of your access to and use of the Services will result in your inability to access and use some or all features of the Services, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Upon any termination of the Terms, the rights granted to you will automatically terminate, you may no longer exercise any of those rights or rights under the Terms. Subject to applicable law, we may, in our sole discretion, provide continued access to and use of the Services prior to such termination.

Dispute Resolution
Governing Law & Forum
California law applies to the Terms, and except as provided under the Arbitration Clause below, courts in Los Angeles will be the only forum for any court proceedings.
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this ‘Dispute Resolution’ section, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and EK are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and you and EK each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
Arbitration
If there is a dispute between us, you and EK agree to try to resolve it informally first. If we can’t resolve it in 60 days, we agree to resolve it in arbitration, not in court. If a court decides part of this section is unenforceable, the rest still applies. You may opt-out of the Arbitration Clause within 30 days of first agreeing to these Terms, under
opt-out
below.
Claims that can be resolved in small claims court or relate to the infringement of our intellectual property do not have to be arbitrated, nor do you have to arbitrate if you choose to opt out of mandatory arbitration.
Arbitration
Clause
You agree to resolve disputes with EK through binding arbitration, except as described in this
Arbitration Clause
(“
Arbitration Clause
”). The parties expressly waive the right to bring or participate in any kind of class, collective, or mass action, private attorney general action, or any other representative action. You may opt-out of arbitration under ‘
Opt-Out
’ below within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.
Covered Disputes
. You and EK agree that any dispute or claim between you and EK arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services (a “
Dispute
”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. A Dispute includes any claim or dispute relating to the Services, access and use of the Services, your account, or any aspects of your relationship or transactions with EK. A Dispute also includes any claims or disputes that arose from or involve facts that occurred before the effectiveness of this Agreement and claims that may arise after its termination. For clarity, nothing in this Arbitration Clause prevents either party from settling any Dispute(s) on a class-wide, batch-wide or other multiparty basis.
Exceptions to Arbitration
. This Arbitration Clause does not require arbitration of the following types of claims brought by either you or EK:
small claims court actions, if the requirements of the court are met and the claims are only on an individual basis; and
claims pertaining to intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents.
Informal Dispute Resolution First
. Like you, we want to resolve Disputes without resorting to arbitration. If you have a Dispute with us, before initiating arbitration, you agree to send an individualized request (“
Pre-Arbitration Demand
”) to
dispute@explodingkittens.com
so that we can work together to resolve the Dispute. This ‘Informal Dispute Resolution First’ provision is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration. The arbitrator will dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.
A Pre-Arbitration Demand is only valid when it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all.
The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address associated with your account; (ii) the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any; (iii) a description of your Dispute; and (iv) your signature.
Likewise, if EK has a Dispute with you, EK will send an email with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address associated with your Account.
If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) calendar days of when either you or EK submitted a Pre-Arbitration Demand, an arbitration can be brought.
This ‘Informal Dispute Resolution First’ provision does not apply to claims under the ‘
Exceptions to Arbitration
’.
Arbitration Procedure
. If, after completing the informal process in ‘
Informal Dispute Resolution First
’, either you or EK wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must serve the other party with a demand for arbitration. Any demand for arbitration by you will be sent to the EK address in ‘
Informal Dispute Resolution First
’. EK will send any arbitration demand to the email address associated with your account or to your counsel, if any. You and EK agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“
FAA
”) governs this Arbitration Clause. If the FAA cannot apply, then the state laws governing arbitration procedures where you reside apply.
The arbitration will be administered by NAM under its operative:
Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, and
where applicable, its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, in each case as available at
https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms
.
This Arbitration Clause will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules.
If the applicable arbitration provider is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. To the extent there is a dispute over which arbitration provider has jurisdiction, a NAM arbitrator will be appointed to resolve that dispute.
Arbitration hearings will take place through videoconferencing, unless you and EK agree upon another location in writing. A single arbitrator will be appointed.
The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and recoverable costs. Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction over the dispute. An arbitration award will have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving EK and a different individual. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to resolve all threshold arbitrability issues, including whether this Arbitration Clause is applicable, unconscionable, or enforceable, as well as any defenses to arbitration. However, a court has exclusive authority to rule on the waiver in ‘
Class Action Waiver'
below, including any claim that the provision is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached.
If a request to proceed in small claims court (see the provisions on Pre-Arbitration Demands under ‘
Informal Dispute Resolution First
’), is made after an arbitration has been initiated, but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration will be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction will be determined by the small claims court.
Jury Trial Waiver
. You and EK agree to waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. You and EK are instead electing that all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Clause, except as specified in ‘
Exceptions to Arbitration
’ above. Court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.
Class Action Waiver
. You and EK agree that, except as specified in ‘
Batch Process
’ below, each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis.
The parties agree to waive all rights to have any Dispute be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis.
Subject to this Arbitration Clause, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief to the party’s individual claim.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Clause, if a court decides, in a final nonappealable decision, that the limitations of this ‘
Class Action Waiver
’ are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and EK agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) will be severed from the arbitration and will be pursued in the courts specified in ‘
Governing Law and Forum Choice
’ above.
Batch Process
. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and EK agree that if 25 or more arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature, are filed within a 180 day period (“
Mass Filing
”):
to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 25 demands per batch (or less, if fewer than 25 remain) (“
Batches
”), with only one Batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time;
to designate one arbitrator for each Batch;
to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion;
that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior Batch is filed, processed, and adjudicated;
that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by EK and the claimants, will only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a Batch that is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and
that the Batch process will continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved.
Any statutes of limitation, including the requirement to file within eighteen (18) months at ‘
18-Month Filing Deadline
’ below, will remain tolled while any arbitration demands are held in abeyance. While the Batches are adjudicated, no other demand for arbitration that is part of the Mass Filing may be processed, administrated, or adjudicated, and no filing or other administrative costs for such a demand for arbitration will be due from either party to the arbitration provider.
If, contrary to this provision, a party prematurely files an arbitration demand, the parties agree that the arbitration provider must hold those demands in abeyance.
Substantially Similar Nature
. All parties agree that arbitration demands are of a “substantially similar nature” if they relate to the same event or factual scenario, raise the same or similar legal issues and seek similar relief.
Mass Filing Administration
. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint a sole standing administrative arbitrator (“
Administrative Arbitrator
”) to determine threshold questions such as (1) whether the Batch process is applicable or enforceable, (2) whether particular demand(s) are part of a Mass Filing, and (3) whether demands within a Mass Filing were filed in accordance with this Arbitration Clause, including ‘
Informal Dispute Resolution First
’ above.
To expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Administrative Arbitrator may provide and use any procedures necessary to resolve the dispute promptly. EK will pay the Administrative Arbitrator’s costs.
The parties will work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Batch within 120 calendar days of its initial pre-hearing conference. The parties agree that the Batch process is designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings.
This ‘
Batch Process
’ will in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless EK otherwise consents in writing, EK does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this ‘
Batch Process
’ provision.
Settlement
. At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or EK may serve a written offer of judgment upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance will be submitted to the arbitration provider, who will enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted before the earlier of (i) the arbitration hearing or (ii) thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, it will be deemed withdrawn, and cannot serve as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party will not recover their post-offer costs and will pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer.
The parties agree that any disputes with respect to settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment in a Mass Filing are to be resolved by a single arbitrator to the extent such offers contain the same material terms. For arbitrations involving represented parties, the represented parties’ attorneys agree to communicate individual offer(s) of judgment to each and every arbitration claimant or respondent to whom such offers are extended.
Arbitration Costs
. Except as provided for in a Mass Filing under ‘
Batch Process
’ above, your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative, and arbitrator costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules.
18-Month Filing Deadline
. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, and notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, any claim or cause of action under this Arbitration Clause (with the exception of disputes for claims pertaining to intellectual property rights including trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents), must be filed within eighteen (18) months after such claim or cause of action arose. Otherwise, that claim or cause of action will be permanently barred. The statute of limitations and any arbitration cost deadlines remain tolled during the required informal process under ‘
Informal Dispute Resolution First
’ above.
Opt-Out
. You may reject this Arbitration Clause and opt out of arbitration by sending an email to
opt-out@explodingkittens.com
within thirty (30) calendar days of first accepting these Terms. If you have an account, your opt-out notice must be sent from the email address associated with your account. No one may opt-out another person. Your notice to opt-out must include your first and last name, address, the email address associated with your account (if you have an account), and a clear statement that you decline this Arbitration Clause (e.g. “I, [first and last name], wish to opt out of the Arbitration Clause.”).
Severability
. Except as provided in ‘
Class Action Waiver
’ above, if any provision of this Arbitration Clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed. The remaining provisions will still apply and will be interpreted to achieve the closest possible intent to the original intent of this Arbitration Clause, inclusive of the severed provision.
Miscellaneous
These Terms are our whole agreement. The official version is English. If parts of the Terms can’t apply, the rest remains, as much as possible. If we don’t enforce part of the Terms, it doesn’t mean we won’t in the future or we won’t enforce our other rights. No one other than you or us can enforce the Terms.
a. Entire Agreement.
The Terms and any other document or information referred to in the Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding between you and us regarding the Services and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between you and us regarding the Services.
b. Language.
The original language of the Terms is in English; any translations are provided for reference purposes only. You waive any right you may have under the law of your country to have the Terms written or construed in any other language.
c. Severability.
The Terms describe certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your jurisdiction. The Terms do not change your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction if the laws of your jurisdiction do not permit it to do so. In the event that certain provisions of the Terms are held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, those provisions will be enforced to the furthest extent possible under applicable law and subject to the ‘
Arbitration Procedure
’ above, the remaining terms of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.
d. No Waiver.
Your and our actions or inactions will not create any other rights under the Terms except as what is explicitly written within the Terms. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by one of our duly authorized representatives. Except as expressly set forth in the Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under the Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Terms or otherwise.
e. Third Party Rights.
A person who is not a party to the Terms will have no right to enforce any of its terms.
f. Interpretation.
If it turns out that a particular term of the Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms. Any words following the terms “including,” “include,” “in particular,” “for example”, “such as” or any similar expression are illustrative, non-exhaustive and do not limit the sense of the words, phrase or description preceding those terms. The word "or" as used in these Terms is not exclusive. The failure of either party to exercise, in any way, any right under these Terms does not waive any further rights the Terms provide.
g. Force Majeure.
In no event will we be liable to you, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing our obligations under the Agreement, to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
You cannot transfer or assign the Terms to anyone else.
h. Assignment
. You may not assign or transfer the Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer the Terms, without such consent, will be null and void. We may freely assign or transfer the Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, the Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

We may share this information within Exploding Kittens and with third parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you.

(The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a user and uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.

This
Privacy Policy
(“
Policy
”) explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your personal information through our services. Exploding Kittens, Inc. is the data controller of the personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service (“
Terms
”). Exploding Kittens, Inc. is referred to in this Policy as “
EK
”, “
we
”, “
our
” or “
us
”.
How we handle your information depends on which services you use, and how you use them. This Policy is grouped into these sections:
about us and this Policy
;
information we collect & why we use it
;
information disclosed to others
;
how to control your privacy
; and
information about local privacy laws
.
We encourage you to read this Policy carefully. If you have questions, please
contact us
.
About Us And This Policy
This Policy is designed to explain how we process your personal information and how you can exercise control over our processing. Capitalized terms that are used but not defined in this Policy are defined in our Terms. The Terms describe how the Services works in general, and establish a contract between you and us governing your use of the Services.

Changes to this Policy
Because the Services change often, this Policy may change over time. Anytime we modify the Policy, we will post a revised version on the Services as noted at
Last Updated
above. If we intend to use your personal information in a way that is materially different from the ways described at the time of collection, we will notify you before the material changes to this Policy take effect, so you have time to review them. If we have your contact information (such as your email or phone number), we will notify you that way. We may also post a temporary notice on the Services, or notify you by other means to the extent required by law.
Check the
Last Updated
date periodically to ensure you’re aware of the current Policy. By using or accessing the Services, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy and the Terms.
When this Policy applies
This Policy applies to you when you use the Services, effective as of the
Last Updated
date. However, some collection and use of information falls outside this Policy:
Outside services
: Outside Materials (as defined in our Terms) are not part of the Services, so this Policy doesn’t apply to any information you may exchange with providers of Outside Materials or other third parties. If you follow a link to a third-party website, your use of that website is governed by that website’s privacy policy, and is not covered by this Policy.
Our personnel
: If you are a current or former employee or contractor of ours, this Policy does not apply to you. Reach out to your human-resources partner or supervisor with any inquiries about your personal information at
privacy@explodingkittens.com
When we don’t control your information
: If we receive your information in our role as a service provider to another business, our agreement with that business governs our use of your information. We will refer any questions or concerns of yours to that business.
Information We Collect & Why We Use It
We collect certain information when you use the services. This includes information you provide through the services, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources. This also includes information you may provide to third-party service providers while using our services.
This section describes, comprehensively, how the services collect and use your information, and our legal basis for that processing. Under certain data protection laws like GDPR, companies must have a “legal basis”—a valid reason—to process personal information. We rely on different legal bases to process your information for the purposes described in this Policy.

Security
EK has implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Still, no data transmission online is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you provide, and you provide it at your own risk.
We cannot promise that your information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we may provide.
Information Disclosed To Others
This section describes how and why we exchange personal information with contractors and third parties. It also describes exchanges made for certain purposes, like advertising, legal reasons and consensual direct marketing. We may also disclose deidentified and aggregate data for these purposes.
Direct marketing
We will only disclose your contact information to third parties for direct marketing purposes if you opt-in, and will only do so until you opt-out. We may share information about you with third party sponsors or partners who will use it for marketing purposes but only if you opt in to such sharing or do not opt out when prompted. We will never share information in this manner without giving you one of these two options.
For personalized ads
We share information with advertising partners to make the advertising presented to you more relevant to you. We also market the Services to you through ads facilitated by marketing vendors.
For example, we use AdRoll to serve ads on the Services and we market the Services to you on third party services. AdRoll uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on your visits to our webpages and to other sites. You can opt out of the use of the AdRoll cookie by visiting its
Opt-Out page
.
We try to limit how third-party advertising technology vendors use information they collect from you. Most providers require us to enter contracts that allow them to optimize their ad services and products. Essentially, they combine any information they may gather about you through our Services with information they receive from their other clients. This helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.
In the past twelve months, we have shared these categories of personal information with third parties to personalize advertising:
Device Information (including Personal Identifiers)
Commercial Information
Internet Activity
Geolocation
With our Affiliates
We may share, link or pool user information among affiliates and business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services, but always in accordance with applicable law, applicable agreements and this Policy.
Functional disclosures
In addition to the use of trackers, cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags described in our
Cookie Policy
, we contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services related to the functionality and features of the Services, including payment processing, shipping and fulfillment, data management, and administration of promotions. We refer to them as “contractors.”
We may disclose information about you, such as personal identifiers, Commercial Information, Activity Data, and Device Information, to contractors as necessary for them to perform their services. Contractors are not permitted to use information about you for any other purpose. In the past twelve (12) months, we have disclosed these types of information to the following types of contractors:
Analytics providers, namely Microsoft Clarity, Facebook Connect, TikTok Analytics, and MNTN to tell us how the Services is doing, such as which parts interest visitors and how long they visit before leaving. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.
Various hosting services and data processors to provide the infrastructure of the Services, such as Cloudfront, which ensures that traffic is from real people, not computers. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.
Privacy providers, namely AdRoll CMP, to manage your data-collection preferences on the Services. Among other data, to set your preferences, they will receive your IP address.
Payment providers, namely ShopPay, PayPal, Google Pay, and Venmo, to process payments between you and us, such as for subscriptions or products. These providers receive information about your order in order to tie your payment process to your order. We don’t receive all of the information you may provide to them as part of that process (for instance, we don’t receive full payment-account numbers).
Support providers, namely Gorgias, to provide assistance to you when you request it. They are able to retrieve information about you that is relevant and necessary to your requests, such as account information and order details.
With your consent or at your request
We may periodically ask for your consent to disclose your information to third parties. Whenever we ask your consent for this reason, we will summarize the purpose and scope of the disclosure. For example, we may offer discounts to you if you consent to join our mailing list or participate in a promotion involving direct marketing communications.
In those cases, the Services will display a tickbox near an email-entry field explaining that by submitting your information, you agree to share your email with the content provider.
To be clear, we only exchange information about you with third parties for direct marketing purposes if you opt-in, and will only do so until you opt-out.
For legal reasons
Finally, we may disclose personal information:
In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us;
When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms and other agreements; or
In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
How Long We Retain Your Information
We retain your information only as long as we need it for the purposes described under ‘
Information we collect & how we use it
’, except when longer retention is required by our compliance policies and efforts toward applicable legal, tax, accounting and regulatory requirements.
How long we need information for those purposes varies by category, and even within categories. These retention determinations always consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from its unauthorized use or disclosure, whether we can achieve those purposes without using the personal information.
For example, we delete some Activity Data as soon as you exit the Services, whereas we may retain records of your orders for products for several years as required by law or contract, such as agreements with our payment processors or under our accounting standards.
Use By Minors
The Services are intended for people 16 and older. If you are between 13 and 15 years of age, you are only permitted to use the Services with your parent or guardian’s prior consent. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13, and we do not share or sell information about anyone under 13 without affirmative authorization. If we learn that we have collected information from a person under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you are under 13: We’re sorry, but please stop using the Services. If you’ve already sent us information, please
contact us
first so we can delete it.
If you are a parent or guardian of a person under 16 years of age who provided information to us without your prior consent, please
contact us
so we can delete it.

International Data Transfers

. By providing your information to us, you consent to the processing of the information in the United States. The transfer of this information to the United States is necessary for the performance of our contract for use of the Services.
When we transfer personal data subject to GDPR outside of the EU, we use standard contract clauses approved by the EU for this purpose, or another appropriate transfer mechanism.
Note that U.S. law is not equivalent to laws in other countries, such as GDPR in Europe or PIPEDA in Canada. As of the
Last Updated
date, the U.S. has not been deemed an ‘adequate’ jurisdiction under GDPR for the purposes of international data transfers. However, the EU and the U.S. are negotiating the terms of an adequacy determination that may go into effect in the years to come.
Information About Local Privacy Laws
The Services operates from the United States, but this Policy applies worldwide. Our practices generally do not differ based on your location, but your rights and choices depend in part on the law where you live.
If any of these local privacy laws apply to you, that section override any contrary descriptions elsewhere in the Policy as they relate to you. If you have questions about your rights under other data privacy laws, please
contact us
.
Requesting information
Submitting requests
To exercise any rights described in this Policy, please
contact us
. Your request must:
provide sufficient information to identify you and the law that applies to you, such as your name, e-mail address, home or work address, or other information we maintain.
not include social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, third-party account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, or health information.
Verifying requests
We verify requests by first confirming the source of the request and then by matching the information submitted to the information we maintain. If your request is unclear or we are unable to authenticate your identity, we will respond with direction on how to remedy the deficiencies, in accordance with law that applies to you.
If we cannot verify the identity of the individual making the request, we may deny it, in full or in part.
Responses to requests
We will respond to your request as quickly as we can, taking into account the nature of your request and the volume of pending requests. The content of our response will vary with the nature of your request, but will always respond in accordance with any deadlines or requirements specified by the laws that apply to you.
Under certain circumstances, we may be unable to provide responsive personal information, such as when disclosure would create a substantial, articulable and unreasonable risk to the security of the information, customers’ account with us, or the security of our systems or networks. We do not disclose account passwords or any other non-personal information that enables access to an account.
Please understand, however, that we reserve the right to retain an archive of any deleted information, to the extent permitted by law. We may also retain deidentified or aggregate data derived from information about you.
