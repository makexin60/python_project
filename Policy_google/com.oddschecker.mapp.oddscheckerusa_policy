Information We Collect
We only collect personal information in order to provide you with some of our Services and we collect your personal information when you register for our newsletter or to use our Service on our Website(s) or App.
Subject to what is said below regarding cookies, you are free to browse the rest of our App and/or Website(s) without information being collected.
You may visit our Website(s) anonymously, and on some occasions, you may be able to deal with us anonymously or by pseudonym. However, to fully use the Service, you will need to register using our online registration form, using our App (either our mobile web App or downloadable App for mobile devices). You may be required to provide us with your contact information (e.g. name, postal address, telephone number and e-mail address).
Using the App's web server log files, we use IP addresses to analyse trends, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  This aggregate information is de-identified and IP addresses are not linked to personal information. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our App or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our App or not), what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address etc.
In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our App. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our App. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. The other type of cookie we use is a “persistent” cookie. This stays on your hard drive and we use this to automatically identify who you are and your preferences in viewing/using the App.
The cookie itself contains no personal information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us to tie the cookie to your personal information. We do this to allow us to let you know on the homepage what has changed on the App since your last visit. We also use the cookie to track website traffic, such as how often you visit the App so we know who our most loyal users are. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use certain features on our App.
