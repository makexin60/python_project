Payment Term

Each Client Affiliate will be invoiced separately. Should the Parties agree to allow Client to pay in a currency other than USD, GBP or EUR, Client shall be charged an additional 0.15% on the invoiced amount.
Late Payment; Disputes
. Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month, or the maximum percentage permitted by law (whichever is lower), in addition to all reasonable costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Any good faith objection to an invoice shall be provided in writing to Riskified within the applicable Payment Term, otherwise Client would be deemed to waive any objections, and such invoice will be deemed final and not subject to dispute.
Taxes
. All fees are exclusive of taxes and duties. If the Services are subject to collection or payment of any federal, state, or local tax under the Agreement, or any other similar taxes or duties levied by any governmental authority, excluding taxes levied on Riskified’s net income, then such taxes and/or duties shall be invoiced to and paid solely by Client upon receipt of invoice.

Early Termination Fee
”), which will be reduced by any and all credits owed to Client in the final invoice.

Vendor Code of Conduct
Riskified Ltd. (“Riskified” ) strives to achieve the highest standard of business and professional integrity, and seeks to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. We expect our vendors, suppliers, distributors, partners, business associates, and third party representatives (“
Vendors
” ) to uphold these standards of conduct and professional integrity and communicate them to their organization.
This Vendor Code of Conduct (“Code”) sets forth Riskified’s expectation that its Vendors uphold the highest standards of ethics and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
These expectations should complement each Vendor’s own company policies, applicable legal requirements, and the terms of any agreements that a Vendor may have with Riskified. Failure to comply with this Code could result in termination of the business relationship. Riskified encourages Vendors to raise questions or concerns about this Code to their Riskified point of contact.
Riskified’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets forth our compliance standards in more detail, is available at
https://ir.riskified.com/corporate-governance/documents-charters
Riskified expects its Vendors to be honest, ethical and transparent when dealing with Riskified, its employees, customers and other third parties.
Vendors are expected to monitor Vendors own compliance with this Code and report any integrity concern or violations of this Code or otherwise involving or affecting Riskified. When requested, Vendors are expected to assist Riskified in investigating concerns.
Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations
Riskified expects its Vendors to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to the Vendor’s business, particularly those related to Vendor’s performance of duties for Riskified.
Anti-corruption compliance & business expenses
Riskified prohibits bribes, kickbacks, or other improper or illegal payments of anything of value from being directly or indirectly offered, paid, promised or authorized in any way related to Riskified, whether it involves public officials (including officers or employees of governments or state-owned entities) or private parties.
Riskified also prohibits bribery to influence a public official, to obtain or retain business from any party, or to secure an unfair business advantage.
Riskified also prohibits Vendors from making facilitation payments, or small, unofficial payments to public officials to expedite routine, non-discretionary government processes or decisions (even if permissible under local law).
All business expenses provided by Vendors related to Riskified’s business – including gifts (whether money or any other thing of value), hospitality, entertainment, events, travel, or accommodation – must comply with any agreements with Riskified; have a legitimate business purpose; be reasonable and modest in value and frequency; comply with local law; and be accurately recorded.
