The minimum age for these purposes shall be 18 years, however if local laws require that you must be older in order for DBCL to lawfully provide the services in the Services to you then that older age shall apply as the applicable minimum age. In all jurisdictions outside the European Union, if you are under the age of 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use Services under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian or responsible adult.
V. Information Sharing
We restrict access to your Personal Information to employees who we believe reasonably need to know/or that information is required in order to fulfill their jobs to provide, operate, develop, or improve our products or services. DBCL does not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide Services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with ‘DBCL’ under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your Personal Information to help DBCL communicate with you about offers from DBCL and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process as per the relevant laws of the countries we operate in, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
We may transfer information about you if ‘DBCL’ is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, ‘DBCL’ will notify you before the information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
DBCL works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.
VI. Retention of Personal Information
Your Personal Information processed by DBCL is kept in a form which permits your identification for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Information is processed in line with legal, regulatory, contractual or statutory obligations as applicable.
VII. Monitoring
To the extent permitted by law, DBCL may record and monitor your communications with us to ensure compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations and our internal policies. This may include the recording of telephone conversations.
VIII. Your Controls and Choices (As applicable under GDPR)
a. Accessing and Rectifying your Personal Information
When you use the Services including the sub sites, we make reasonable efforts to provide you, as and when requested by you, with access to your Personal Information and shall further ensure that any Personal Information or sensitive personal data or information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed or corrected before processing such requests. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, requiring disproportionate technical effort, jeopardizing the privacy of others, or that are extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. You can make such requests by sending us an email.
b. Right to Rectification
