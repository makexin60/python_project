Customer Privacy Notice
Your privacy is and will always be enormously important to us. Our Privacy Notice is designed to provide transparency into our data practices in a format that is easy to read and navigate. Please read the sections below to understand how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information in order to offer you the most seamless vehicle and energy experience imaginable.
Privacy From Day One
Your Tesla generates vehicle, diagnostic, infotainment system, and Autopilot data. To protect your privacy from the moment you take delivery, Tesla does not associate the
vehicle data
generated by your driving with your identity or account by default. As a result, no one but you would have knowledge of your activities,
location
or a history of where you’ve been. Your in-vehicle experiences are also protected. From features such as voice commands, to surfing the web on your touchscreen, your information is kept private and secure, ensuring the
infotainment data
collected is not linked to your identity or account.
Tesla vehicles are equipped with a camera suite designed from the ground up to protect your privacy while providing advanced features such as Autopilot, Actually Smart Summon, and Autopark. To recognize things like lane lines, street signs and traffic light positions,
Autopilot data
from the camera suite is processed directly without leaving your vehicle by default. In order for camera recordings for fleet learning to be shared with Tesla, your consent for
Data Sharing
is required and can be controlled through the vehicle’s touchscreen at any time. Even if you choose to opt-in, unless we receive the data as a result of a safety event (a vehicle collision or airbag deployment) — camera recordings remain anonymous and are not linked to you or your vehicle.
Additionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, your Energy products are designed to protect your privacy. Tesla aims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary for displaying your in-app energy experience, providing services to you, and for improving your energy products. We are also committed to only share your personal data when needed to operate or service your product, or we will ask for your permission.

There are four categories of data generated by your Tesla vehicle: Vehicle Data, Diagnostic Data, Infotainment System Data, and Autopilot Data.
Vehicle Data
In order to support your vehicle’s continuous performance, predictive maintenance, and improved functionality and experience, your Tesla collects and processes vehicle data related to the usage, operation, and condition of your vehicle. This information is used to triage and fix potential issues, and continuously improve your vehicle and services to you. To protect your privacy, by default, this vehicle data is either in a form that is not associated with your account or VIN, is stored in an encrypted format that Tesla cannot decrypt, or remains inaccessible unless a specific event is triggered:
If your vehicle may require, or you otherwise request service or repair
If there is an occurrence of a safety event (such as vehicle collision, airbag deployment or emergency braking event)
If your vehicle requires safety services such as emergency response or Roadside Assistance
If your vehicle experiences a hardware or software issue which may be inspected and addressed through a future software update or other resolution
If you provide your consent, or another legal basis is applicable
We clearly define the vehicle data which we collect and don’t collect. Tesla does not link your location with your account or identity, or keep a history of where you’ve been. Examples of the vehicle data collected include: speed information, odometer readings, vehicle component signals, internet connectivity status, battery use management information, battery charging history, electrical system functions, software version information, infotainment system data, safety-related data and camera images (including information regarding the vehicle’s SRS systems, braking and acceleration, security, and e-brake); short video clips of accidents; information regarding Autopilot engagements, Dumb Summon, Sentry and other features, and other data to assist in identifying issues and analyzing the performance of the vehicle.
Location Services:
Your Tesla vehicle uses location to power features such as in-vehicle maps, navigation, or mobile app location services. Location Services may use a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, IP address, and Wi-Fi and mobile towers to figure out where you are. To protect your privacy, location data is either processed directly without leaving your vehicle, is in a form that does not personally identify you, or remains inaccessible to Tesla. For safety purposes, your vehicle's location may be used when you experience a safety event (such as a collision, an airbag deployment, or automatic emergency braking event) to aid response efforts. This means that unless captured as a result of a safety event— Tesla does not link your location to your identity or know where you’ve been. You may also choose to enable or disable the collection of ‘Road Segment Data Analytics’ at any time within your vehicle’s touch screen by navigating to Software > Data Sharing. Please note, some advanced features such as real-time traffic and intelligent routing rely on such data.
Safety analysis data:
In order to help improve our products and services, we may collect and store other vehicle data that might contain information that identifies you or your vehicle’s VIN, including: data about accidents or near accident-like circumstances involving your Tesla vehicle (for example, Airbag deployment or automatic emergency braking event); data about remote services (for example, remote lock/unlock, start/stop charge, and honk-the-horn commands); a data report to confirm that your vehicle is online together with information about the current software version and certain telematics data; data about any issues that could materially impair operation of your vehicle; data about any safety-critical issues; and data about each software and firmware update.
Advanced features:
Certain features such as real-time traffic, navigation, intelligent routing, Autopilot, and Dumb Summon, may require road segment data to function as intended. To protect your privacy, you may enable or disable the collection of this data at any time (Software > Data Sharing). If enabled, we may share this data in a way that does not identify your account or VIN with partners in order to help us improve and provide the service to you. This sharing may occur even if you are not actively using a feature that needs this information.
Charging information:
We may collect information regarding the charge rate and charging stations used by you (including use of superchargers, as well as home or commercial outlets) in order to, for example, analyze which charging stations are being utilized, how long and efficient battery charges are, where additional charging stations are needed, and in some jurisdictions, participate in certain government incentive or credit programs.
Service history:
In order to facilitate the service and repair of your vehicle, we may collect and process data about the service history from Tesla service centers or affiliated third-party approved body shops. This includes information such as name, VIN, repair history, parts details, estimate and costs, outstanding recalls, bills due, customer complaints, and any other information related to the vehicle’s service history.
Opting out of vehicle data:
Connectivity and performance is a core part of all Tesla vehicles and why some customers choose Tesla, allowing for advanced features and an enhanced driving experience. By default, Tesla provides this seamless experience while protecting your privacy. However, if you no longer wish for us to collect vehicle data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle, please contact us to deactivate connectivity. Please note, certain advanced features such as over-the-air updates, remote services, and interactivity with mobile applications and in-car features such as location search, Internet radio, voice commands, and web browser functionality rely on such connectivity. If you choose to opt out of vehicle data collection (with the exception of in-car Data Sharing preferences), we will not be able to know or notify you of issues applicable to your vehicle in real time. This may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.
Diagnostic Data
Tesla uses diagnostic logs to keep our products and services up to date, troubleshoot or debug problems, and make continuous improvements. We aim to collect the minimum level of diagnostic data necessary to help keep your vehicle or energy product reliable, secure, and operating normally. Diagnostics may include details about vehicle configuration, firmware, energy use, electronic systems state, and other system-to-system data used to identify bugs and conduct technical evaluations. On specific events, we use diagnostic logs as basic error information to help determine whether the problems experienced can be addressed by an immediate or future software release.
Infotainment System Data
When using your vehicle’s touchscreen, Tesla may collect certain usage analytics that are either stored on the vehicle itself, or if shared with us, is not associated with your account or VIN by default. Usage analytics may include, for example, aggregated counts of the features or apps used, playback and browsing metadata (such as radio listening time and channel), and approximate location for local radio options.

To protect your privacy, your in-vehicle browser history and sign-in credentials are not shared with Tesla. For certain infotainment apps that require sign-in, if you do not have your own account, Tesla offers the option to use the app with a Tesla provisioned account instead. If you choose to use a Tesla provisioned account, then your infotainment system data for that specific app may be associated with your account or VIN. Additionally, if you experience performance issues with your infotainment and require support, Tesla may retrieve certain infotainment system data to fulfill your request, effectively troubleshoot or debug the issue, and improve our products and services.
Voice commands:
Each Tesla is equipped with the ability for you to use your voice to speak commands to the vehicle. To support ongoing quality improvements, Tesla captures and processes the transcription of the command (such as “set the temperature…”). To protect your privacy, audio voice recordings are not captured, and the transcription of the command is not associated with your account or VIN. In addition, Tesla does not collect any information when using voice-to-text, as such your text messages are never sent to Tesla.
Tesla mobile app:
The Tesla app puts owners in direct communication with their vehicles. With the app, you have the capability to do things like check your vehicle's charging progress in real time, start/stop charging, heat/cool the cabin before driving, lock/unlock the vehicle from afar, share destinations and calendar information, or view the vehicle’s current location. In order to detect and proactively fix issues related to the Tesla app’s functionality, address any customer complaints, and to prevent unauthorized access or misuse, certain general usage information associated with your account or VIN may be shared with us. For example, if you use the Tesla app to change the vehicle’s cabin temperature, we may collect that this command was successful or unsuccessful, without further details, such as the change in degrees. The Tesla app also allows you to upload images, for example, when submitting your service or repair request, for customer support assistance, product installations, to update your Tesla profile picture, and more.
Autopilot Data
Tesla vehicles make use of a camera suite that provides advanced features such as Autopilot, Actually Smart Summon, and Autopark. Camera functionality has been designed from the ground up to protect your privacy. Tesla does not capture continuous recordings or have live-view functionality. By default, advanced autonomous features that rely on the external cameras are processed without ever leaving your vehicle. There are two types of camera recordings that are eligible to be transmitted from your vehicle to Tesla: Safety Event and Fleet Learning camera recordings.
Safety Event camera recordings are automatically captured only if a serious safety event occurs such as a vehicle collision or airbag deployment. These short clips are up to 30 seconds and associated with your VIN in order to aid in providing emergency services, vehicle evaluation, and Roadside Assistance (and such recordings may include timestamp and location metadata).
Fleet Learning camera recordings use the vehicle’s external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs and traffic light positions. The more fleet learning of road conditions we are able to do, the better your Tesla’s self-driving ability will become. We want to be very clear that in order for Fleet Learning camera recordings to be shared with Tesla, your consent for Data Sharing is required and can be controlled through the vehicle’s touchscreen at any time by navigating to Software> Data Sharing. Even if you choose to opt-in, the camera recordings are limited to 30 seconds and remain anonymous, ensuring it’s not linked to you or your vehicle.
Dashcam:
Dashcam is a feature available to customers, provided a properly configured USB drive is used. All recorded video is stored locally on the USB drive and not transmitted to Tesla. Before enabling this feature, please remember to consult your country’s local laws related to dashcam usage in order to comply with all regulations and property restrictions.
Sentry Mode:
This feature uses the vehicles sensors and external cameras to detect and notify you when there is suspicious activity or a significant threat to your vehicle while parked. If a threat is detected, such as someone leaning on the car, Sentry Mode will flicker the headlights, display a message on the touchscreen indicating that the cameras are recording, and save footage of the event to your USB drive (if installed). Sentry Mode footage is not transmitted to Tesla. For significant threats, such as a window break-in, the vehicle will also send an alert to the mobile app paired with the car, activate the security alarm, and generate a loud unexpected sound from the audio system. Sentry Mode footage is saved to onboard memory and can be viewed directly from the vehicle’s touchscreen. Sentry Mode can also operate in a similar manner without a USB drive installed, with the ability to send you an alert to your phone if a threat is detected — however, footage of the event would not be available.
If you have enabled Sentry Mode Live Camera Access, this allows you to remotely view your car's surroundings while in park, and also honk, flash headlights, and talk through the car’s speaker. Audio from the car’s surroundings is not recorded. To enable or disable, tap Controls > Safety & Security. When in use, the car's headlights will pulse and the touchscreen will show Sentry Mode is activated. Live Camera is end-to-end encrypted and cannot be accessed by Tesla.
Please note it is your sole responsibility to consult and comply with all local regulations and property restrictions regarding the use of cameras.
Cabin Camera:
Eligible
Tesla vehicles are equipped with a cabin camera located above the rearview mirror. Cabin camera is off by default unless enabled by you when using an associated safety or convenience feature (such as Autopilot or Dog Mode). When Autopilot is engaged the cabin camera can determine driver inattentiveness and provide you with audible alerts, to remind you to keep your eyes on the road. You can view which features you have granted permission to use cabin camera at any time (Controls > Software > Cabin Camera). To improve features that rely on cabin camera, you can choose to opt-in and share Cabin Camera Analytics (Controls > Software > Data Sharing) with Tesla. To protect your privacy, even if you opt-in to sharing this information, this camera data is not associated with your account or VIN. You may change this setting at any time.
Sound Detection
: Tesla vehicles are equipped with sound detection technology. Before features can use the microphone for sound detection, the vehicle will request your permission. Features that rely on sound detection, process the data on the car itself by default. Meaning the system cannot save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled. Tesla does not capture continuous recordings and does not have live-listening functionality.
You can opt-in and share sound detection data (up to 1 minute in duration) with Tesla to improve the intelligence of safety and convenience features like emergency vehicle detection, Voice Commands, or in the occurrence of a safety critical event. To adjust your data sharing preferences, navigate to Controls > Software> Data Sharing > Allow Sound Detection Analytics. Note, it is your responsibility to confirm consent of occupants. Even if you choose to opt-in, to protect your privacy, sound detection data is not associated with your account or VIN.

Customer Privacy Notice
Your privacy is and will always be enormously important to us. Our Privacy Notice is designed to provide transparency into our data practices in a format that is easy to read and navigate. Please read the sections below to understand how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information in order to offer you the most seamless vehicle and energy experience imaginable.
Privacy From Day One
Your Tesla generates vehicle, diagnostic, infotainment system, and Autopilot data. To protect your privacy from the moment you take delivery, Tesla does not associate the
vehicle data
generated by your driving with your identity or account by default. As a result, no one but you would have knowledge of your activities,
location
or a history of where you’ve been. Your in-vehicle experiences are also protected. From features such as voice commands, to surfing the web on your touchscreen, your information is kept private and secure, ensuring the
infotainment data
collected is not linked to your identity or account.
Tesla vehicles are equipped with a camera suite designed from the ground up to protect your privacy while providing advanced features such as Autopilot, Actually Smart Summon, and Autopark. To recognize things like lane lines, street signs and traffic light positions,
Autopilot data
from the camera suite is processed directly without leaving your vehicle by default. In order for camera recordings for fleet learning to be shared with Tesla, your consent for
Data Sharing
is required and can be controlled through the vehicle’s touchscreen at any time. Even if you choose to opt-in, unless we receive the data as a result of a safety event (a vehicle collision or airbag deployment) — camera recordings remain anonymous and are not linked to you or your vehicle.
Additionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, your Energy products are designed to protect your privacy. Tesla aims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary for displaying your in-app energy experience, providing services to you, and for improving your energy products. We are also committed to only share your personal data when needed to operate or service your product, or we will ask for your permission.

There are four categories of data generated by your Tesla vehicle: Vehicle Data, Diagnostic Data, Infotainment System Data, and Autopilot Data.
Vehicle Data
In order to support your vehicle’s continuous performance, predictive maintenance, and improved functionality and experience, your Tesla collects and processes vehicle data related to the usage, operation, and condition of your vehicle. This information is used to triage and fix potential issues, and continuously improve your vehicle and services to you. To protect your privacy, by default, this vehicle data is either in a form that is not associated with your account or VIN, is stored in an encrypted format that Tesla cannot decrypt, or remains inaccessible unless a specific event is triggered:
If your vehicle may require, or you otherwise request service or repair
If there is an occurrence of a safety event (such as vehicle collision, airbag deployment or emergency braking event)
If your vehicle requires safety services such as emergency response or Roadside Assistance
If your vehicle experiences a hardware or software issue which may be inspected and addressed through a future software update or other resolution
If you provide your consent, or another legal basis is applicable
We clearly define the vehicle data which we collect and don’t collect. Tesla does not link your location with your account or identity, or keep a history of where you’ve been. Examples of the vehicle data collected include: speed information, odometer readings, vehicle component signals, internet connectivity status, battery use management information, battery charging history, electrical system functions, software version information, infotainment system data, safety-related data and camera images (including information regarding the vehicle’s SRS systems, braking and acceleration, security, and e-brake); short video clips of accidents; information regarding Autopilot engagements, Dumb Summon, Sentry and other features, and other data to assist in identifying issues and analyzing the performance of the vehicle.
Location Services:
Your Tesla vehicle uses location to power features such as in-vehicle maps, navigation, or mobile app location services. Location Services may use a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, IP address, and Wi-Fi and mobile towers to figure out where you are. To protect your privacy, location data is either processed directly without leaving your vehicle, is in a form that does not personally identify you, or remains inaccessible to Tesla. For safety purposes, your vehicle's location may be used when you experience a safety event (such as a collision, an airbag deployment, or automatic emergency braking event) to aid response efforts. This means that unless captured as a result of a safety event— Tesla does not link your location to your identity or know where you’ve been. You may also choose to enable or disable the collection of ‘Road Segment Data Analytics’ at any time within your vehicle’s touch screen by navigating to Software > Data Sharing. Please note, some advanced features such as real-time traffic and intelligent routing rely on such data.
Safety analysis data:
In order to help improve our products and services, we may collect and store other vehicle data that might contain information that identifies you or your vehicle’s VIN, including: data about accidents or near accident-like circumstances involving your Tesla vehicle (for example, Airbag deployment or automatic emergency braking event); data about remote services (for example, remote lock/unlock, start/stop charge, and honk-the-horn commands); a data report to confirm that your vehicle is online together with information about the current software version and certain telematics data; data about any issues that could materially impair operation of your vehicle; data about any safety-critical issues; and data about each software and firmware update.
Advanced features:
Certain features such as real-time traffic, navigation, intelligent routing, Autopilot, and Dumb Summon, may require road segment data to function as intended. To protect your privacy, you may enable or disable the collection of this data at any time (Software > Data Sharing). If enabled, we may share this data in a way that does not identify your account or VIN with partners in order to help us improve and provide the service to you. This sharing may occur even if you are not actively using a feature that needs this information.
Charging information:
We may collect information regarding the charge rate and charging stations used by you (including use of superchargers, as well as home or commercial outlets) in order to, for example, analyze which charging stations are being utilized, how long and efficient battery charges are, where additional charging stations are needed, and in some jurisdictions, participate in certain government incentive or credit programs.
Service history:
In order to facilitate the service and repair of your vehicle, we may collect and process data about the service history from Tesla service centers or affiliated third-party approved body shops. This includes information such as name, VIN, repair history, parts details, estimate and costs, outstanding recalls, bills due, customer complaints, and any other information related to the vehicle’s service history.
Opting out of vehicle data:
Connectivity and performance is a core part of all Tesla vehicles and why some customers choose Tesla, allowing for advanced features and an enhanced driving experience. By default, Tesla provides this seamless experience while protecting your privacy. However, if you no longer wish for us to collect vehicle data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle, please contact us to deactivate connectivity. Please note, certain advanced features such as over-the-air updates, remote services, and interactivity with mobile applications and in-car features such as location search, Internet radio, voice commands, and web browser functionality rely on such connectivity. If you choose to opt out of vehicle data collection (with the exception of in-car Data Sharing preferences), we will not be able to know or notify you of issues applicable to your vehicle in real time. This may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.
Diagnostic Data
Tesla uses diagnostic logs to keep our products and services up to date, troubleshoot or debug problems, and make continuous improvements. We aim to collect the minimum level of diagnostic data necessary to help keep your vehicle or energy product reliable, secure, and operating normally. Diagnostics may include details about vehicle configuration, firmware, energy use, electronic systems state, and other system-to-system data used to identify bugs and conduct technical evaluations. On specific events, we use diagnostic logs as basic error information to help determine whether the problems experienced can be addressed by an immediate or future software release.
Infotainment System Data
When using your vehicle’s touchscreen, Tesla may collect certain usage analytics that are either stored on the vehicle itself, or if shared with us, is not associated with your account or VIN by default. Usage analytics may include, for example, aggregated counts of the features or apps used, playback and browsing metadata (such as radio listening time and channel), and approximate location for local radio options.

To protect your privacy, your in-vehicle browser history and sign-in credentials are not shared with Tesla. For certain infotainment apps that require sign-in, if you do not have your own account, Tesla offers the option to use the app with a Tesla provisioned account instead. If you choose to use a Tesla provisioned account, then your infotainment system data for that specific app may be associated with your account or VIN. Additionally, if you experience performance issues with your infotainment and require support, Tesla may retrieve certain infotainment system data to fulfill your request, effectively troubleshoot or debug the issue, and improve our products and services.
Voice commands:
Each Tesla is equipped with the ability for you to use your voice to speak commands to the vehicle. To support ongoing quality improvements, Tesla captures and processes the transcription of the command (such as “set the temperature…”). To protect your privacy, audio voice recordings are not captured, and the transcription of the command is not associated with your account or VIN. In addition, Tesla does not collect any information when using voice-to-text, as such your text messages are never sent to Tesla.
Tesla mobile app:
The Tesla app puts owners in direct communication with their vehicles. With the app, you have the capability to do things like check your vehicle's charging progress in real time, start/stop charging, heat/cool the cabin before driving, lock/unlock the vehicle from afar, share destinations and calendar information, or view the vehicle’s current location. In order to detect and proactively fix issues related to the Tesla app’s functionality, address any customer complaints, and to prevent unauthorized access or misuse, certain general usage information associated with your account or VIN may be shared with us. For example, if you use the Tesla app to change the vehicle’s cabin temperature, we may collect that this command was successful or unsuccessful, without further details, such as the change in degrees. The Tesla app also allows you to upload images, for example, when submitting your service or repair request, for customer support assistance, product installations, to update your Tesla profile picture, and more.
Autopilot Data
Tesla vehicles make use of a camera suite that provides advanced features such as Autopilot, Actually Smart Summon, and Autopark. Camera functionality has been designed from the ground up to protect your privacy. Tesla does not capture continuous recordings or have live-view functionality. By default, advanced autonomous features that rely on the external cameras are processed without ever leaving your vehicle. There are two types of camera recordings that are eligible to be transmitted from your vehicle to Tesla: Safety Event and Fleet Learning camera recordings.
Safety Event camera recordings are automatically captured only if a serious safety event occurs such as a vehicle collision or airbag deployment. These short clips are up to 30 seconds and associated with your VIN in order to aid in providing emergency services, vehicle evaluation, and Roadside Assistance (and such recordings may include timestamp and location metadata).
Fleet Learning camera recordings use the vehicle’s external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs and traffic light positions. The more fleet learning of road conditions we are able to do, the better your Tesla’s self-driving ability will become. We want to be very clear that in order for Fleet Learning camera recordings to be shared with Tesla, your consent for Data Sharing is required and can be controlled through the vehicle’s touchscreen at any time by navigating to Software> Data Sharing. Even if you choose to opt-in, the camera recordings are limited to 30 seconds and remain anonymous, ensuring it’s not linked to you or your vehicle.
Dashcam:
Dashcam is a feature available to customers, provided a properly configured USB drive is used. All recorded video is stored locally on the USB drive and not transmitted to Tesla. Before enabling this feature, please remember to consult your country’s local laws related to dashcam usage in order to comply with all regulations and property restrictions.
Sentry Mode:
This feature uses the vehicles sensors and external cameras to detect and notify you when there is suspicious activity or a significant threat to your vehicle while parked. If a threat is detected, such as someone leaning on the car, Sentry Mode will flicker the headlights, display a message on the touchscreen indicating that the cameras are recording, and save footage of the event to your USB drive (if installed). Sentry Mode footage is not transmitted to Tesla. For significant threats, such as a window break-in, the vehicle will also send an alert to the mobile app paired with the car, activate the security alarm, and generate a loud unexpected sound from the audio system. Sentry Mode footage is saved to onboard memory and can be viewed directly from the vehicle’s touchscreen. Sentry Mode can also operate in a similar manner without a USB drive installed, with the ability to send you an alert to your phone if a threat is detected — however, footage of the event would not be available.
If you have enabled Sentry Mode Live Camera Access, this allows you to remotely view your car's surroundings while in park, and also honk, flash headlights, and talk through the car’s speaker. Audio from the car’s surroundings is not recorded. To enable or disable, tap Controls > Safety & Security. When in use, the car's headlights will pulse and the touchscreen will show Sentry Mode is activated. Live Camera is end-to-end encrypted and cannot be accessed by Tesla.
Please note it is your sole responsibility to consult and comply with all local regulations and property restrictions regarding the use of cameras.
Cabin Camera:
Eligible
Tesla vehicles are equipped with a cabin camera located above the rearview mirror. Cabin camera is off by default unless enabled by you when using an associated safety or convenience feature (such as Autopilot or Dog Mode). When Autopilot is engaged the cabin camera can determine driver inattentiveness and provide you with audible alerts, to remind you to keep your eyes on the road. You can view which features you have granted permission to use cabin camera at any time (Controls > Software > Cabin Camera). To improve features that rely on cabin camera, you can choose to opt-in and share Cabin Camera Analytics (Controls > Software > Data Sharing) with Tesla. To protect your privacy, even if you opt-in to sharing this information, this camera data is not associated with your account or VIN. You may change this setting at any time.
Sound Detection
: Tesla vehicles are equipped with sound detection technology. Before features can use the microphone for sound detection, the vehicle will request your permission. Features that rely on sound detection, process the data on the car itself by default. Meaning the system cannot save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled. Tesla does not capture continuous recordings and does not have live-listening functionality.
You can opt-in and share sound detection data (up to 1 minute in duration) with Tesla to improve the intelligence of safety and convenience features like emergency vehicle detection, Voice Commands, or in the occurrence of a safety critical event. To adjust your data sharing preferences, navigate to Controls > Software> Data Sharing > Allow Sound Detection Analytics. Note, it is your responsibility to confirm consent of occupants. Even if you choose to opt-in, to protect your privacy, sound detection data is not associated with your account or VIN.
