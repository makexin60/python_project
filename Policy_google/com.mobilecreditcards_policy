Introduction and Overview
At NerdWallet Inc. (“NerdWallet,” “we,” “our,” “us”), our mission is to provide you with clarity for all of your life’s financial decisions. We do so by empowering you with financial information and guidance you can trust and by providing you with tools to help you make the best decisions for your financial needs.
When you use our websites and applications and input your Personal Information, we have an obligation to provide you with clarity regarding how your data is accessed and used by NerdWallet, its affiliates, vendors, partners and other third-party entities.

What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices related to your access and use of NerdWallet Services and the NerdWallet Platform.
NerdWallet Services
. When we say “NerdWallet Services” or “Services,” this means the products and services that are made available and directly provided by NerdWallet, Inc. or its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Fundera, Inc., NerdWallet Advisory, Inc., and Next Door Lending d/b/a NerdWallet Mortgage Experts d/b/a NerdWallet Homes, through our websites and mobile applications. This includes, for example, our lending, credit, financial planning, and insurance products and services.
NerdWallet Platform
. When we say “NerdWallet Platform” or “Platform,” this means the products and services that are made available by our unaffiliated third-party partners under a co-branded arrangement where we share your information and/or receive your information from these partners with your consent. This includes, for example, when you sign up for the NerdUp credit card, tax preparation services, investing services, vehicle selling services, and certain NerdWallet+ Program services. When we share your information with our unaffiliated third-party partners, their privacy policy may apply.
Please note NerdWallet is a financial institution and most of our data collection, use, and sharing practices are governed by the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. You can review our

When we say “Personal Information,” we use this as a general term to mean information that can be any information about an individual from which that person can be reasonably identified.

We may collect Personal Information directly from you when you use the NerdWallet Platform and Services — for example, when you register to become a member, request to prequalify for a third-party credit card or loan product, request your TransUnion credit report and/or score, link your third-party financial accounts, or fill out calculators, forms or other fields.
Here are the types of Personal Information we may collect:

Cookies
Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your device as you browse the web or use a web-enabled app.
There are two broad categories of cookies:
First party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device when you use a web-enabled app.
Third-party cookies, which are served by a third-party on our behalf. We use third-party cookies for functionality, analytics, marketing, and social media purposes.
As explained below, cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time:
Single-session (temporary) cookies. Temporary cookies last only as long as your web browser is open and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation on our Website. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.
Multi-session (persistent). Persistent cookies are stored on your computer or device for longer periods and are used for purposes including session management (for example, to recognize you and recall your individual login information and preferences).
Like most companies, we generally use cookies to track the number of unique visitors and information such as the number of view a page gets, how much time a user spends on a page and other web statistics; monitor the performance of our NerdWallet Services and to continually improve it; and customize and enhance your online experience.
We classify cookies in the following categories:
Non-targeting
cookies
. These cookies are primarily used for operational, performance/analytical, and functional purposes. Combined, these cookies assist us with providing you with services available through the NerdWallet Services and Platform and to use some of the available features.
Targeting cookies
. These cookies may be set through our NerdWallet Services and Platform by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly Personal Information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
How to control or delete cookies
Most browsers also allow you to adjust your cookie settings. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser. In order to adjust these settings, please consult the “Help” function of your browser, or the documentation published online for your particular browser type and version. For residents of certain jurisdictions, you may be able to adjust your cookie settings by visiting our

In addition, certain of our third-party partners may use this information to display online advertisements tailored to your interests and preferences across your browsers and devices, to conduct ad campaign measurement and website analytics, to detect, prevent and report fraud, or to carry out their own business and commercial purposes.
Where information collected through web beacons, buttons, and similar technologies is collected directly by third-parties, their collection and use of information is subject to that third-party’s own privacy policies. Some of these third-parties are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance and participate in the industry’s opt out, available at

You deserve clarity and choice regarding our use of your personal data.
Effective date: March 13, 2025
Introduction and Overview
At NerdWallet Inc. (“NerdWallet,” “we,” “our,” “us”), our mission is to provide you with clarity for all of your life’s financial decisions. We do so by empowering you with financial information and guidance you can trust and by providing you with tools to help you make the best decisions for your financial needs.
When you use our websites and applications and input your Personal Information, we have an obligation to provide you with clarity regarding how your data is accessed and used by NerdWallet, its affiliates, vendors, partners and other third-party entities.
To that end, this Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you, how we collect it, how we use your information, whom we disclose your information to, and the steps we take to protect your information.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices related to your access and use of NerdWallet Services and the NerdWallet Platform.
NerdWallet Services
. When we say “NerdWallet Services” or “Services,” this means the products and services that are made available and directly provided by NerdWallet, Inc. or its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Fundera, Inc., NerdWallet Advisory, Inc., and Next Door Lending d/b/a NerdWallet Mortgage Experts d/b/a NerdWallet Homes, through our websites and mobile applications. This includes, for example, our lending, credit, financial planning, and insurance products and services.
NerdWallet Platform
. When we say “NerdWallet Platform” or “Platform,” this means the products and services that are made available by our unaffiliated third-party partners under a co-branded arrangement where we share your information and/or receive your information from these partners with your consent. This includes, for example, when you sign up for the NerdUp credit card, tax preparation services, investing services, vehicle selling services, and certain NerdWallet+ Program services. When we share your information with our unaffiliated third-party partners, their privacy policy may apply.
Please note NerdWallet is a financial institution and most of our data collection, use, and sharing practices are governed by the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. You can review our
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Privacy Notice
for a summary of privacy options related to most of NerdWallet Platform and Services.
By using and accessing the NerdWallet Platform and Services, you are consenting to receive notices about your financial privacy electronically
.
We encourage you to read the entire Privacy Policy. By becoming a NerdWallet member or using the NerdWallet Platform and Services, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Privacy Policy. Your use of the NerdWallet Platform and Services is subject to the
NerdWallet Terms of Use
and your use of the NerdWallet+ Program is subject to the NerdWallet+ Terms (collectively, the “Terms”). We use the same terms here as in Terms. We will let you know in this Privacy Policy if we have a new or different definition of a term.
Information We Collect
When we say “Personal Information,” we use this as a general term to mean information that can be any information about an individual from which that person can be reasonably identified.
Information we collect directly from you
We may collect Personal Information directly from you when you use the NerdWallet Platform and Services — for example, when you register to become a member, request to prequalify for a third-party credit card or loan product, request your TransUnion credit report and/or score, link your third-party financial accounts, or fill out calculators, forms or other fields.
Here are the types of Personal Information we may collect:
Contact and registration information
. Information you provide when you sign up to become a member, activate a subscription or upload information into the NerdWallet Platform or Service including your name, title and honorifics, email address, mailing address, phone number, date of birth, username and password.
Identity information
. Information to verify your identity including your name, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number or other government issued identification, or similar information.

Financial information, such as your payment information (credit card information), bank account information, investments, income, expenses, assets, liabilities, financial goals, investing risk tolerance or other similar types of information about your job or business. We also may collect third-party financial account information, such as an ID and password.
Demographic information
. Information including your age, gender, or other similar demographic information when such information is relevant to a particular financial product or service you have requested (for example, when requesting auto insurance rates or using retirement planning calculators).

Inferences about customer preferences and characteristics
. We may infer from information provided by you, information collected directly from your browser or device, or from information obtained from third-party marketing database partners.
We do not store your third-party financial account ID or passwords. Instead, we securely pass this information to our third-party partners when you request services that require us to confirm your identity, when you request to prequalify for their products, and/or to provide you with access to your financial information on the NerdWallet Platform or Services.
Information collected from third-parties
When you use NerdWallet Platform or Services, we may also obtain information about you from unaffiliated third-parties, such as our business partners, referral partners or advertisers when you authorize these parties to do so. The information we collect depends on the type of third-party and what you authorize them to share with us. For example, we collect Personal Information from:
Banking institutions

Cookies and Other Technologies
When you use or visit the NerdWallet Services and Platform, we may send one or more cookies or and similar tracking technologies.
Cookies
Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your device as you browse the web or use a web-enabled app.
There are two broad categories of cookies:
First party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device when you use a web-enabled app.
Third-party cookies, which are served by a third-party on our behalf. We use third-party cookies for functionality, analytics, marketing, and social media purposes.
As explained below, cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time:
Single-session (temporary) cookies. Temporary cookies last only as long as your web browser is open and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation on our Website. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.
Multi-session (persistent). Persistent cookies are stored on your computer or device for longer periods and are used for purposes including session management (for example, to recognize you and recall your individual login information and preferences).
Like most companies, we generally use cookies to track the number of unique visitors and information such as the number of view a page gets, how much time a user spends on a page and other web statistics; monitor the performance of our NerdWallet Services and to continually improve it; and customize and enhance your online experience.
We classify cookies in the following categories:
Non-targeting
cookies
. These cookies are primarily used for operational, performance/analytical, and functional purposes. Combined, these cookies assist us with providing you with services available through the NerdWallet Services and Platform and to use some of the available features.
Targeting cookies
. These cookies may be set through our NerdWallet Services and Platform by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly Personal Information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
How to control or delete cookies
Most browsers also allow you to adjust your cookie settings. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser. In order to adjust these settings, please consult the “Help” function of your browser, or the documentation published online for your particular browser type and version. For residents of certain jurisdictions, you may be able to adjust your cookie settings by visiting our
cookie preferences center
.
Third-party web beacons and third-party buttons
We may implement third-party advertising or other content on the NerdWallet Services or Platform that may use clear GIFs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write Cookies to your web browser in connection with your viewing of the third-party content on the NerdWallet Services or Platform. Additionally, we may implement third-party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow a third-party to collect information about you through their browser Cookies, even when you do not interact with the button.
We also engage third-party partners and vendors like Google Analytics, Hotjar and others, who provide analytics and advertising services, to assist us in providing you the NerdWallet Services or Platform. We allow these third-parties, including unaffiliated business partners, advertising networks, analytics providers, and other advertising service providers, to automatically collect Clickstream Data and other information about your online activities on the NerdWallet Services or Platform and across your browsers and devices using cookies, web beacons, mobile advertising identifiers and other technologies.

In addition, certain of our third-party partners may use this information to display online advertisements tailored to your interests and preferences across your browsers and devices, to conduct ad campaign measurement and website analytics, to detect, prevent and report fraud, or to carry out their own business and commercial purposes.
Where information collected through web beacons, buttons, and similar technologies is collected directly by third-parties, their collection and use of information is subject to that third-party’s own privacy policies. Some of these third-parties are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance and participate in the industry’s opt out, available at
http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/
or at
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/
. Additionally, you may opt out of the use of Google Analytics Cookies here:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
Due to differences between using websites and apps on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to opt out on both platforms. Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of interest-based advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile device settings. You also may uninstall our app using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace. Please note that your opt-out choice will apply only to the browser and device you are using when you opt out.

‍
1. Scope
Canopy Connect, Inc. (“we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information through our software, website, mobile applications, documentation, and related services (together, the “Services”).
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning as set forth in the Terms of Service for the Services, which can be found on our
Terms page
.
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We do not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale of such information in a way that specifically identifies the individual (i.e. we don’t sell customer lists). You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using some or all of the Services.
You are able to share Personal Information with third parties through use of the Services (including our business customers, or “Innovators”). The privacy policies of these third parties are not under our control and may differ from ours. The use of any information that you may provide to any third parties will be governed by the privacy policy of such third party or by your independent agreement with such third party, as the case may be. If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing to a third party, we recommend that you contact that third party directly for more information or to review its privacy policy.

2. Collection of Information
Information you provide
Our technology makes it easier for you to get value and convenience from your insurance data by making it safer and easier to connect your personal insurance information to software applications created by Innovators that help you do things like verify your active insurance to close on a mortgage or drive a car, save money, cover a home or vehicle, or understand and select coverage options. When you connect your insurance accounts with a Developer application or otherwise connect your insurance accounts through us, we collect login information required by the provider of your account, such as your username and password, answers to challenge questions, or a security token (these are referred to below as your “Login Information”). When providing this information, you give the Developer and us the authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your information from the relevant insurance institution. Your Login Information, as well as any other information we gather through the Services that may be used to identify, contact, or locate you individually, are collectively referred to herein as your “Personal Information.”
We may collect contact information, such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our marketing materials, request customer or technical support, apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us.
We may post job openings and opportunities on our Services. If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to assess your qualifications.
Information collected from your insurance institutions
The information we receive from the insurance institutions that maintain your insurance accounts varies depending on the information made available by those institutions. But, in general, we collect the following types of information from your insurance institutions:
Account information
Information about policies, vehicles, and Personal Information related to providing accurate insurance data;
Information about billing transactions, including amount, date, type, quantity, price, and a description of the transaction.
Information received from your devices
Our technology is generally embedded in our Innovators’ applications. When you use your device to connect to our services through a Developer application, we receive information about that device, including IP address, hardware model, operating system, and other technical information about the device.
We may collect Personal Information automatically when you use our Services:
Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Other Technologies. We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through your use of our Services.
Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.
Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:
Operationally Necessary. This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functionality;
Performance-Related. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how individuals use our Services (see Analytics below);
Functionality-Related. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;
Advertising- or Targeting-Related. We may use first party or third-party Technologies to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Services or on third-party websites.
Analytics. We may use Technologies and other third-party tools to process analytics information on our Services. For example, our analytics partners include
Google Analytics. For more information, please visit Google Analytics’ Privacy Policy . To learn more about how to opt-out of Google Analytics’ use of your information, please click here .
Information we receive about you from other sources

• The manner in which information is maintained and flows through our systems, and how best to manage the lifecycle of information in light of the volume and complexity of the systems in our infrastructure.
Individual pieces of personal information such as those listed above may exist in different systems that are used for different business or legal purposes. A different maximum retention period may apply to each use case of the information.

REGION SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES
1. Residents of the State of California have the right to request information from ScribeUp regarding other companies to whom the company has disclosed certain categories of information during the preceding year for the other companies' direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, contact us at support@scribeup.io.

NerdWallet Privacy Policy
You deserve clarity and choice regarding our use of your personal data.
Effective date: March 13, 2025
Introduction and Overview
At NerdWallet Inc. (“NerdWallet,” “we,” “our,” “us”), our mission is to provide you with clarity for all of your life’s financial decisions. We do so by empowering you with financial information and guidance you can trust and by providing you with tools to help you make the best decisions for your financial needs.
When you use our websites and applications and input your Personal Information, we have an obligation to provide you with clarity regarding how your data is accessed and used by NerdWallet, its affiliates, vendors, partners and other third-party entities.
To that end, this Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you, how we collect it, how we use your information, whom we disclose your information to, and the steps we take to protect your information.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices related to your access and use of NerdWallet Services and the NerdWallet Platform.
NerdWallet Services
. When we say “NerdWallet Services” or “Services,” this means the products and services that are made available and directly provided by NerdWallet, Inc. or its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Fundera, Inc., NerdWallet Advisory, Inc., and Next Door Lending d/b/a NerdWallet Mortgage Experts d/b/a NerdWallet Homes, through our websites and mobile applications. This includes, for example, our lending, credit, financial planning, and insurance products and services.
NerdWallet Platform
. When we say “NerdWallet Platform” or “Platform,” this means the products and services that are made available by our unaffiliated third-party partners under a co-branded arrangement where we share your information and/or receive your information from these partners with your consent. This includes, for example, when you sign up for the NerdUp credit card, tax preparation services, investing services, vehicle selling services, and certain NerdWallet+ Program services. When we share your information with our unaffiliated third-party partners, their privacy policy may apply.
Please note NerdWallet is a financial institution and most of our data collection, use, and sharing practices are governed by the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. You can review our
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Privacy Notice
for a summary of privacy options related to most of NerdWallet Platform and Services.
By using and accessing the NerdWallet Platform and Services, you are consenting to receive notices about your financial privacy electronically
.
We encourage you to read the entire Privacy Policy. By becoming a NerdWallet member or using the NerdWallet Platform and Services, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Privacy Policy. Your use of the NerdWallet Platform and Services is subject to the
NerdWallet Terms of Use
and your use of the NerdWallet+ Program is subject to the NerdWallet+ Terms (collectively, the “Terms”). We use the same terms here as in Terms. We will let you know in this Privacy Policy if we have a new or different definition of a term.
Information We Collect
When we say “Personal Information,” we use this as a general term to mean information that can be any information about an individual from which that person can be reasonably identified.
Information we collect directly from you
We may collect Personal Information directly from you when you use the NerdWallet Platform and Services — for example, when you register to become a member, request to prequalify for a third-party credit card or loan product, request your TransUnion credit report and/or score, link your third-party financial accounts, or fill out calculators, forms or other fields.
Here are the types of Personal Information we may collect:

Information collected from third-parties
When you use NerdWallet Platform or Services, we may also obtain information about you from unaffiliated third-parties, such as our business partners, referral partners or advertisers when you authorize these parties to do so.

Cookies
Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your device as you browse the web or use a web-enabled app.
There are two broad categories of cookies:
First party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device when you use a web-enabled app.
Third-party cookies, which are served by a third-party on our behalf. We use third-party cookies for functionality, analytics, marketing, and social media purposes.
As explained below, cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time:
Single-session (temporary) cookies. Temporary cookies last only as long as your web browser is open and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation on our Website. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.
Multi-session (persistent). Persistent cookies are stored on your computer or device for longer periods and are used for purposes including session management (for example, to recognize you and recall your individual login information and preferences).
Like most companies, we generally use cookies to track the number of unique visitors and information such as the number of view a page gets, how much time a user spends on a page and other web statistics; monitor the performance of our NerdWallet Services and to continually improve it; and customize and enhance your online experience.
We classify cookies in the following categories:
Non-targeting
cookies
. These cookies are primarily used for operational, performance/analytical, and functional purposes. Combined, these cookies assist us with providing you with services available through the NerdWallet Services and Platform and to use some of the available features.
Targeting cookies
. These cookies may be set through our NerdWallet Services and Platform by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly Personal Information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
How to control or delete cookies
Most browsers also allow you to adjust your cookie settings. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser. In order to adjust these settings, please consult the “Help” function of your browser, or the documentation published online for your particular browser type and version. For residents of certain jurisdictions, you may be able to adjust your cookie settings by visiting our
cookie preferences center

In addition, certain of our third-party partners may use this information to display online advertisements tailored to your interests and preferences across your browsers and devices, to conduct ad campaign measurement and website analytics, to detect, prevent and report fraud, or to carry out their own business and commercial purposes.
Where information collected through web beacons, buttons, and similar technologies is collected directly by third-parties, their collection and use of information is subject to that third-party’s own privacy policies. Some of these third-parties are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance and participate in the industry’s opt out, available at

Once you have registered for a NerdWallet account, you may update or correct your profile information and preferences at any time by logging in and going to your account settings.

Deactivating your account
We do not delete information about you upon deactivation of your account. Although your deactivated status is reflected promptly in our user databases, we may retain the information you submit for a variety of purposes, including legal compliance, backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. Upon deactivation, you will no longer receive emails from us and links to third-party financial accounts, and services will automatically terminate.
Unsubscribing and managing communications from us
1. How to unsubscribe from email communications
If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you can opt out of receiving emails from us (except for emails related to the completion of your registration, correction of user data, change of password, and other similar communications essential to your transactions through the Services) by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom of any marketing email from us. Although your changes are reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics.
2. How to unsubscribe from SMS communications
We may provide our registered NerdWallet and Fundera customers with SMS alerts regarding their activity on the Service.

However, even if you request a deletion, we may be required to maintain your information for as long as necessary to:
comply with our legal or regulatory compliance needs (e.g. maintaining records of transactions you have made with us);
