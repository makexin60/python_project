BIFROST CLOUD PTE. LED. PRIVACY POLICY
Last updated on September 24th, 2020
The bifrost Privacy Policy is designed to help you better understand the information we collect and the different ways we may use or share it.
This policy applies to your use of the bifrost services. By “bifrost services,” we mean any of our websites, stores, games, applications, or other products or services that link to this policy. Additional terms and conditions may also apply to your relationship with bifrost, depending on how you choose to interact with us. Please read this entire policy to make sure you fully understand it. You should also be sure to carefully review other terms potentially applicable to your visit and your use of specific bifrost services (such as dedicated games or the use of your bifrost Account with third-party games), and confirm that you understand and agree to them, before using the bifrost services.
bifrost and our subsidiaries operate and support the bifrost services from different locations around the world. When we say “bifrost” or “BIFROST CLOUD PTE. LED.” we’re referring to the relevant bifrost entity identified for your region in the “How to Contact Us” section of the policy below. This bifrost entity is responsible for providing the bifrost services to you and is the controller of information collected under this policy.
Please see “How to Contact Us” below to learn more about sending us any privacy-related questions or concerns you may have.
Information We Collect
We generally collect information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account, making purchases, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect information automatically from your use of the bifrost services, such as through cookies or our games and other software, and (3) other parties, such as game console platforms and social networks, may provide information to us. Each of these methods is described in more detail below.
(1) Information You Provide
You may provide your personal information to us when you choose to use the bifrost services. Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with information also may change. Some of the most common examples of situations in which you may provide information to us include:
Creating a bifrost account;
Using the bifrost services’ social features (see “When You Use Social Features of the bifrost Services”);
Purchasing something from us or otherwise engaging in a transaction with us;
Entering online competitions or registering for or participating in special events;
Entering contests or sweepstakes, participating in any of our promotions, or accepting any prizes from us;
Signing up for email alerts or subscribing to receive other information from us;
Completing a survey;
Using a mobile device, such as a phone, to play our games or use our applications; and
Contacting us for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or customer service.
The specific types of information you may be able to provide us will often vary depending on the bifrost cloud you are using and how you interact with them.
(2) Information We Collect Automatically
We collect some information automatically when you visit the bifrost cloud. We typically aggregate this data and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals. If a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal information.
We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, log files, web beacons, and our back-end servers collect usage data transmitted from the bifrost cloud. We use the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, addressing technical issues, preventing fraud or misuse of our services, and conducting data analytics. The type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes:
Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications);
Usage information and statistics about your interaction with the bifrost cloud, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, and other usage statistics;
Crash reports, which may be automatically generated when a game or application crashes and includes information about your system and the crash;
Information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience, such as your display name or other user identification provided in connection with your application use or game play, saved preferences, game progress, and device identifiers or usage information for authentication and fraud prevention purposes; and
The location of your device, such as may be derived from your device’s IP address.
Please note that if certain features on the bifrost cloud are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of the bifrost cloud or others’ websites over time. These features are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.
Fraud Prevention & Anti-Cheat:
Providing users with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on the bifrost cloud is extremely important to us. We strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the bifrost cloud. When you create an bifrost account, buy our products or services, play our games, or otherwise interact with the bifrost on or through the bifrost cloud, we may use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity. These services may collect and analyze data about the game binary or your computer to detect cheating, and may be provided by bifrost or by third parties such as BattleEye.
(3) Information We Receive from Others
In some cases, other parties provide us with information about you, or allow us to collect information about you. We generally collect information from other parties in four ways: (1) you interact with bifrost using a service that is not controlled by us, such as a social network, (2) you choose to use a social feature of the bifrost cloud, (3) you access bifrost cloud through another party, such as a gaming console or mobile device operator, or (4) you link a third party account to your bifrost account. In some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties, like social networks, make available to us. In those cases, we use only the data that we need to provide the types of services we think our users want and expect. Although we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this policy.
When You Interact with bifrost on Third Party Services
When you interact with bifrost on a website or app not controlled by bifrost, that website or app may allow bifrost access to certain information about you. For example, social networks may provide us with information from your profile on their services or other information that you agreed the social network or other party could provide to us.
How We Use and Share Information
As a general matter, we use and share the information we collect (either individually or in combination with other information collected as described in this policy) to help us provide, improve, customize, analyze, and market the bifrost cloud where we have an appropriate basis to do so.
(1) Use
