For this purpose, the legal basis will be taken as a starting point and the retention period will be tailored to the period during which TBAuctions needs the data to achieve the purpose of processing.
11.
With whom are your details shared?
TBAuctions partners with other parties to provide you services and will only pass information to third parties that fall within the following scope:
Affiliated companies: affiliated companies belonging to TBAuctions and its subsidiaries, if these companies offer comparable data protection and the transfer of data is permitted.
Service providers: We commission other companies and individuals to work on our behalf. Examples of service providers include companies that offer delivery services or payment processing (credit card, direct debit and purchase on account) or professional bidding agents who act on behalf of customers. When TBAuctions uses the services of third parties, it enters into agreements with these parties, from which no independent obligation arises for them with respect to the processing of personal data. These service providers have access to the personal information (including name and address details, e-mail address and telephone number) necessary to carry out their work (e.g. the delivery of lots). However, they are not permitted to use this data for other purposes.
Sellers: Your personal information may be shared with our Sellers. If you make a purchase whereby the lot is shipped to you, we will share your name, address and contact information (phone number and email address) with the Seller so that the shipment can be completed. If you make a purchase where the Seller organizes the pickup day, we will share your name, address and phone number with the Seller so that you can be contacted about the desired pickup time. The Seller may also contact you in case you have an outstanding invoice. Finally, we will share your information with the Seller if you have a complaint about your purchase and TBAuctions has not been able to resolve it as part of its mediation role. The Seller will then contact you directly. Please note: If your contact details change during an auction, during a complaint or shortly after a complaint has been resolved, we may provide your 'old' contact details to the Seller if there is reason to believe that this is necessary for the Seller to obtain the rights under the sales contract.
In all other cases, you will be informed if your personal data is to be transmitted to third parties and you will be given the opportunity to individually consent to this.
For each disclosure we will ensure that the necessary contractual safeguards are in place to protect your personal information.
In all cases where personal data is transferred within the above context to third parties in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will only transfer the data in accordance with this Privacy statement and applicable privacy protection regulations.
In principle, all data will be processed within the EU wherever possible and will not be exchanged with parties outside the EU. Data may only be exchanged by TBAuctions with a non-EU country if the recipient can guarantee the same level of data protection, either on the basis of the legislation in force in that country or through separate agreements as prescribed by the EU in the EU format for a binding agreement.
