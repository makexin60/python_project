1. THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
a. Information You Provide to Us
You may choose voluntarily to provide certain personal information to
        us. Personal information is information that can be used to identify
        you, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, credit
        card information, billing information, driver's license number, and
        social security number.
For example, you may decide to share your first and last name, date of
        birth, location, email address, phone number, username and password,
        and the country and state in which you reside when you create an
        account to log in to our network ("
Account
"). We need
        this information to set up your Account, verify your identity, and
        provide you with our Services.
When you use our Website, Application(s), or Services, or deposit or
        withdraw funds from your Account, we may collect all information
        necessary to complete the transaction and provide you with the
        Services, including your name, address, email address, phone number,
        credit or debit card information and other billing information, social
        security number, tax documents, and records of the products and
        Services you purchased, obtained, or considered.
If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect
        your name and email address, as well as any other content provided in
        the email, in order to send you a reply, provide customer and technical
        support, improve and optimize our Services, satisfy our legal
        obligations, enforce our contracts, and address any existing or
        anticipated disputes.
We will collect the profile photo you upload and username you choose
        for your public profile page including in connection with our social
        networking features ("
Profile
") to give you a
        personalized experience of our Services. When you participate in any
        contest, game or other gaming-related product or promotion through the
        Website, Application(s), or Services (each, a "
Game
"
        or, collectively, "
Games
"), other participants (each,
        a "
Player
") will be able to see the information you
        selected for your Profile.
If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to
        send us your location or by otherwise permitting us to geolocate you),
        we may store and use that information to verify your eligibility to
        enter certain Games, to comply with relevant laws, and for fraud
        prevention purposes.
When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional
        information about your Profile, activity, usage, and preferences
        related to the Website, Applications and Services, so that we can
        evaluate your interest in and the quality of our products, Services,
        and customer and technical support.
If you participate in a sweepstakes, Game, or giveaway through our
        Services, we may collect your email address and phone number, to notify
        you if you win or not. We may also ask for users' first and last names
        and addresses, in order to verify their identities. In some situations
        we may need to collect other information about user preferences as part
        of the entry process, such as a prize selection, or in connection with
        the award of prizes over a certain dollar amount. Such sweepstakes and
        Games are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules for each
        sweepstakes and Game before you enter it.

        other DraftKings users may be able to see your Profile information,
        including your username, real name, photo, location, the content you

        about the Games you participate in, including the bets you have made
        and your betting unit data as shown in your betting feed, along with
        your aggregated betting data on our trending bets page. In the event
        you elect to sync, upload, or import data about your contacts from your

        provide you and your contacts with our Services, help you find and
        connect with your contacts through our social networking features, help
        your contacts connect with you through our social networking features,
        and for other purposes set forth in this privacy notice. In general,

        features is public and you should exercise caution and good judgment
        before you post, upload, sync, import or otherwise share information

        unlawful information. You are solely responsible for the content you
        post and other information you provide, whether by posting, syncing,
        importing, uploading or otherwise, when you choose to use our social
        networking features. You may control who is able to view and access the
        information you share by using our social privacy settings. The privacy

b. Information Collected via Technology
Information Collected by our Services.
In order to improve, personalize, and optimize our Services and meet
        our legal obligations, we may automatically track certain information
        about your visits to and usage of our Website, Applications, and
        Services, including your browser type, operating system, Internet
        Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your
        computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to
        session), device identifier, domain name, clickstream data,
        referring/exist pages, geolocation, and a date/time stamp for your
        visit. We also use this information to analyze trends, administer the
        Website, gather demographic information about our user base, deliver
        advertising, perform research, provide technical and customer support,
        inform our product development efforts, protect our legal rights,
        address disputes, and prevent our Services from being used to commit
        harmful or unlawful activities, including fraud. Some of this
        information may also be collected so that when you use the Website,
        Applications, or Services again, we will be able to recognize you and
        optimize your experience accordingly.
Device Information.
We may collect information about the devices you use to access our
        Services, including the hardware models, operating systems and
        versions, software, file names and versions, preferred languages,
        unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial numbers,
        device motion information, and mobile network information. If you have
        downloaded our mobile Application(s), we may also collect certain
        information from your mobile device, including information about how
        you use the Application(s). This information is generally used to help
        us deliver relevant information to you. In the event our Application(s)
        crash on your mobile device, we will also receive information about
        your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which
        allows us to identify and fix bugs, provide other technical support,
        and improve and optimize the performance of our Application(s).
Cookies.
Like many online services, we use "cookies" to collect technical
        information. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website
        sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the website.
        We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web
        browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you
        delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive
        experience on our Website, Application(s), and Services. We may use
        cookies to collect information about your IP address, browser type,
        operating system, device type and identifiers, platform type, as well
        as your usage of and activity on our Website and Application(s) and the
        performance of our Services. These types of information are collected
        to make the Website, Application(s) and Services more useful to you and
        to tailor your online experience to meet your special interests and
        expectations. You can use the options in your web browser to notify you
        when you receive a cookie or you may change your cookie preferences in
        your Internet browser or with third parties. You can control and/or
        delete cookies used by our Services at any time. For instructions on
        how to delete cookies using your particular internet browser, visit
https://www.aboutcookies.org/
. You can delete all existing cookies on your computer and adjust
        settings for most browsers to prevent cookies from being received.
Pixel Tags.
In addition, we use "pixel tags" (also referred to as clear gifs, web
        beacons, or web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique
        identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track
        online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored
        on a computer's hard drive or web browser, pixel tags are embedded
        invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags are often used in combination with
        cookies, trigger the placing of cookies, and transmit information to us
        or our service providers. This enables two websites to share
        information. The resulting connection can include information such as a
        device's IP address, the time a person viewed the pixel, an identifier
        associated with the browser or device, the type of browser being used
        and the URL of the web page from which the pixel was viewed. Pixel tags
        also allow us to send email messages in a format that users can read,
        tell us whether emails have been opened, and help to ensure we are
        sending only messages that may be of interest to our users. We may also
        use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
Threat Detection.
We use certain service providers, such as ThreatMetrix, to provide
        threat detection, user authentication, and fraud prevention services.
        These service providers may automatically collect certain information
        about your visits to the Website and Application(s), as well as the
        device you use to connect to our Services, in order to monitor for
        potential threats and bad actors. This information may include, among
        other things, your IP address and your device's unique identifiers. If
        you would like to know more about ThreatMetrix's data privacy
        practices, please review their privacy policy located at:
https://www.threatmetrix.com/privacy-policy
.
Collection of Data in Connection with Advertising.
We may use certain vendors to serve ads on our Services
, as well as on other websites, applications, and social media
            networks.
In connection with the delivery of advertising, certain vendors
, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, TikTok,
            Snapchat, FantasyPros, LiveRamp, The Trade Desk and TruSignal,
may collect information about you and your visits to this and other
        websites. That information may include your IP address, internet
        service provider, unique personal identifiers (e.g., email address),
        and the browser you use to visit and use our Services and other
        websites and applications. They may do this by using cookies, beacons,
        pixel tags, clear gifs, or other technologies. The information
        collected may be used, among other purposes, to deliver advertising
        targeted to your interests and to better understand your usage of,
        preferences on, and visitation of our Services and other sites, social
        media networks, and applications tracked by such vendors. This notice
        does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies, pixel tags
        and other technologies used in connection with other parties' ads, and
        we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and ad
        services to learn about their use of such technologies. If you would
        like more information about these practices to understand your options
        for not having your information collected and used by such companies,
        please click

and

Third Party Analytics.
We use a number of service providers, such as Google Analytics, to help
analyze how people use our Services ("
Analytics Companies
"). Analytics Companies use cookies
        and similar technologies to collect information pertaining to how
        people use our Website and Applications, what pages they visit, and
        what other sites they may have used prior to using our Services. We use
        the information we get from Analytics Companies to improve and optimize
        our Website, Applications, and Services.
Referral Affiliates.
We may enter into agreements with companies that refer users to our
        Services via hyperlinks available on the referring party's website. We
        may automatically collect certain information, such as your IP address,
        other personal identifiers, and the identity of the referring website
        via cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies that are provided to
        us in connection with your use of the referring party's website.
Location Information.
We may collect your location information, including your geolocation
        records, for purposes of verifying whether you are eligible to
        participate in a Game, sweepstakes, or giveaway or to determine if you
        are otherwise permitted to use our Services. We may also use such
        information to comply with our legal obligations, protect our legal
        rights, and address existing or anticipated disputes.
c. Information Collected From or About Friends
Refer-a-Friend.
Our Services may enable you to invite your friends to join in the fun.
        We enable users to invite friends in two ways:
You may invite a friend to register on our Services by providing us
            with their email address. We will collect any email address you so
            provide in order to facilitate the invitation. In this case, we
            rely upon you to obtain any consents from the third party that may
            be required by law to allow us to access and upload the third
            party's name and email address as required. If you are using one of
            our Applications to refer-a-friend, the Application may also
            collect your phone number, which we may use for fraud prevention,
            user authentication, and to provide our Services. You or the third
party may contact us at
privacy@draftkings.com
to request the removal of this information from our database.
We may enable you to send your friends an invite to register on our
            Services via text message. We employ various techniques to enable
            you to invite your friends via text message, including offering
            contact importer tools to facilitate adding your contacts,
            including contacts in your address book, so that you can readily
            ask your contacts to join and communicate with you through the
            Services. With your permission, we will access your address book,
            and import your contacts' names, email addresses, phone numbers,
            images, geolocation details and other information associated with
            your contacts to determine which of your friends have not
            registered an Account. The text message that is sent to your
            friends will come from your phone number so that your friends know
            that you want to invite them to visit the Website or
            Application(s). During this process, we also collect your phone
            number (to send you a text message for account verification
            purposes), some information on your settings that help us interpret
            your data (such as language and keyboard settings that you set),
            and the identity of your phone's carrier, mobile network code, and
            mobile country code. Such information is collected in order to
            facilitate your and your friends' use of our Website,
            Application(s), and Services.
Find-a-Friend.
Our Services may also enable you to invite your friends who already
        have an Account to enter a Game. In order to invite friends with
        Accounts to join a Game, you may: (i) enter your friend's username
        associated with their account to find and locate them; or (ii) in the
        event you are using our Application(s), use our contact importer tool
        to import and search through your contacts, including contacts in your
        address book, in order to match those of your friends who are also
        registered users of the Services. With your permission, we will access
        your address book, and import your contacts' names, email addresses,
        phone numbers, image, geographic location, and other information
        associated with your contact in order to facilitate connection with
        your friends.
d. Information Collected from Other Sources
We may supplement the information we have about you with information
    received from other sources including from our pages on certain Social
    Networking Sites, the Social Networking Sites themselves, and from
    commercially available sources (e.g., data brokers and public databases).
    Your activity on other websites and applications may be associated with
    your personal information in order to improve and customize our Services
    and the ads delivered on our Website and Application(s). The information we
    receive may include demographic data such as age, gender and income level,
    your preferences, interests, associations, commercial information,
    including records of products or services purchased, obtained, or
    considered and other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies, as
    well as information regarding your interaction with various websites and
    applications, including the Services. This information is used to create
    and deliver advertising, improve and optimize our marketing efforts,
    perform user verification, authentication and fraud detection, and comply
    with our legal obligations.

Social Networking Sites.
Our Website, Application(s), and Services may enable you to post
content to Social Networking Services (e.g., Facebook) (each, a "
SNS
"). If you choose to do this, we will provide
        information to such SNSs in accordance with your elections. In such
        event, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for
        your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review
        the terms of use and privacy policy of the companies providing such
        SNSs. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or
        accuracy of any SNS's terms of use or privacy policy; (ii) the content,
        products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use
        of any such SNSs.
Corporate Affiliates.
We may share some or all of your personal information with our
        corporate affiliates, including, without limitation, our subsidiaries,
        joint ventures and other companies under a common control
        ("Affiliates"), in which case we will require our Affiliates to respect
        this notice.

We may share some or all of your personal information in connection
        with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition,

        involving the sale, transfer, divestiture or disclosure of all or a
        portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency,
        bankruptcy, or receivership, your personal information may also be
        transferred as a business asset.
Other Disclosures.
Regardless of the choices you make regarding your personal information
        (as described below), DK may disclose personal information if it in
        good faith believes that such disclosure is necessary (i) to comply
        with relevant laws (e.g., gaming regulations) or to respond to
        discovery requests, subpoenas, or warrants served on DK; (ii) in
        connection with any legal investigation; (iii) to protect or defend the
        rights or property of DK or users of the Website, Application(s), or
        Services; (iv) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or
        potential violation of law, this notice, or our Terms of Use; or (v) if
        we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious
        injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of information.
Advertising Alliances Opt-out:
In addition to adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser, many
        advertising companies that may collect information for targeted
        advertising purposes are also members of the Digital Advertising
        Alliance or the Network Advertising Initiative. Both of these
        organizations provide directions on how individuals can opt-out from
        targeted advertising by their members. You can find more information on
these opt-out capabilities on
www.aboutads.info
and
www.networkadvertising.org

5. SECURITY AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
The security of your information is important to us. We use reasonable
        administrative, technical, and physical procedures, practices, and
        safeguards designed to protect personal information we collect from
        unauthorized access, use, alteration, exfiltration, or destruction.
        Additionally, we will keep your information for only as long as it is
        needed to achieve its purpose or meet our legal obligations.
We make concerted, good faith efforts to maintain the security of your
        information. Although we work hard to ensure the integrity and security
        of our systems, it must be recognized that no information system is
        100% secure and, therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of such
        information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure,
        unauthorized use, or other factors may compromise the security of user
        information at any time.

        but please note that we may be legally or otherwise required to keep

8. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
Various browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari,
    currently offer a "Do Not Track" or "DNT" option that relies on a
    technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited
    by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Please note
    that, at this time, we do not honor "DNT" signals or other mechanisms that
    may allow you to opt out of the collection of information across networks
    of websites and online services as there is no standard for how online
    services should respond to such signals. As standards evolve, we may
    develop policies for responding to DNT signals that would be described in
    future versions of this notice. For more information on DNT options, please
    visit
www.allaboutdnt.org
.
9. PROHIBITED USERS

12. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California Consumer Privacy Act
California residents ("CA customers") have certain rights concerning their
    personal information, including under the California Consumer Privacy Act
    of 2018 ("CCPA"). The preceding sections of this notice describe DK's
    practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of personal
    information. This section supplements the preceding sections by describing
    CA customers' additional rights with respect to their personal information
    and explaining how to exercise such rights.
As discussed above, we collect and use the following categories of personal
    information addressed in the CCPA for the business and commercial purposes
    described in this notice: real name; username; postal address; email
    address; telephone number; social security number; driver's license, state
    identification, and passport numbers; date of birth and age; profile
    photographs; gender information; credit card, debit card, and bank account
    numbers and other payment and financial information; tax information and
    documents; commercial information, including records of products or
    services purchased, obtained, or considered; income level data; information
    on users' interaction with the Website and Application(s) and other
    websites and applications, including information on preferences, usage,
    communications, subscriptions, SNS usernames, associations, likes, and
    public profile information; and inferences drawn from such information. We
    collect this personal information from the categories of sources described
    above. We may disclose the foregoing categories of personal information for
    our business and commercial purposes to the extent permitted by applicable
    law.
Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Used, Shared,
            or Sold.
CA customers have the right to request that we disclose the following
    information for the period covering the 12 months preceding their request:
the categories of personal information we collected about you;
the categories of sources from which we collected personal
            information about you;
the categories of personal information that we have disclosed about
            you for our business purposes and the categories of suppliers to
            whom the personal information was disclosed;
the categories of personal information that we sold to third
            parties and the categories of third parties to whom the personal
            information was sold, if any;
the business or commercial purpose(s) for which personal
            information about you was collected, shared or sold; and
the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.
Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information.
CA customers have the right to request that DK delete the personal
    information we maintain about them, subject to certain exceptions.
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information.
CA customers have the right to opt-out of a business's sale of their
    personal information. Under the CCPA, the terms "sell," "selling," or
    "sale" mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making
    available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or
    by electronic or other means, a CA customer's personal information to
    another business or third party for monetary or other valuable
    consideration. The CCPA provides that a business does not sell personal
    information when:
the customer uses or directs the business to intentionally disclose
            his or her personal information or uses the business to
            intentionally interact with a third party, as long as the third
            party does not also sell the personal information; or
the business uses or shares with a service provider personal
            information of a customer that is necessary to perform a business
            purpose, as long as (i) the business has provided appropriate
            notice that personal information is being used or shared and (ii)
            the service provider does not further collect, sell, or use the
            personal information of the customer except as necessary to perform
            the business purpose.
As described above, we and certain other companies place tracking
    technologies on our Services, which allow us and such companies to receive
    information about your activity on our Services that is associated with
    your browser or device. Based on our current understanding of the CCPA, DK
    believes this is not a "sale" of personal information and that we have not
    sold the personal information of CA customers, including minors under 16
    years of age, within the preceding 12 months.
CA customers
    may control the use of certain tracking technologies and request to opt-out
    of the "sale" of personal information by clicking our Do Not Sell My
    Personal Information link in the footer of the Website and following the
    instructions on the page that appears. Please also keep in mind that your
    cookie and tracking tool preferences are specific to the device, website,
    and browser you are using and are deleted when you clear your browser's
    cache.
Right to Non-Discrimination for Exercising Privacy Rights.
DK will not discriminate against CA customers for exercising their rights
    under the CCPA.
How To Exercise Your Rights.
You may submit a request by emailing us at
privacy@draftkings.com
or by
    sending us a privacy request through the Contact Us web form located at
https://www.draftkings.com/help/contact-us
Please note that DK may deny or fulfill a request only in part, based on
    our legal rights and obligations. Please also note that, except as
    otherwise provided by applicable California law, for purposes of these
    rights, personal information does not include information about job
    applicants, employees and other of our personnel or information about
    employees and other representatives of third-party entities we may interact
    with.
When we receive a request, we will verify the identity of the requestor and
    undertake to respond within the periods set by California law. If a CA
    customer has a password-protected account with DK, we may verify their
    identity through DK's existing authentication practices and will require
    him or her to re-authenticate themselves before disclosing or deleting the
    customer's data. If a CA customer does not have a password-protected
    account, we will take reasonable steps to verify their identity in
    accordance with the CCPA prior to responding any request. The verification
    steps may vary depending on the sensitivity of the personal information. If
    we cannot verify a requestor's identity using these methods, we may use an
    appropriate third-party verification service.
Designating an Authorized Agent to Submit Privacy Requests.
CA customers may use an authorized agent to submit a Request to Know or a
    Request to Delete. An authorized agent is a person or entity registered
    with the California Secretary of State that a CA customer has authorized to
    act on his or her behalf. If you choose to submit a privacy request to DK
    through an authorized agent, we may require that you provide the agent with
    written permission to do so and that the agent verify their own identity
    with DK. If your privacy request is submitted by an agent without proof
    that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf, we may deny
    the request.
"Shine the Light" Law
A CA customer who has provided personal information to a business with whom
    he has established a business relationship for personal, family, or
    household purposes is entitled to request information about whether the
    business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the
    third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has
    made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request
    by a CA customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third
    parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding
    calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information
    that were disclosed.
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the
    above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public
    (in its privacy policy or notice) a policy of not disclosing customers'
    personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes
    unless the business gives users a mechanism to opt out of having their
    personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing
    purposes. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the
    customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information
    and providing a cost-free means to exercise the right.
We have opted for this alternative approach. As stated in this notice, we
    give customers a mechanism to opt out of having their personal information
    disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Therefore,
    we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of third parties that
    received your personal information for marketing purposes. If you wish to
    opt-out of sharing your personal information with third parties for their
direct marketing purposes, please email us at
privacy@draftkings.com
or send
    us a privacy request through the Contact Us web form located at
https://www.draftkings.com/help/contact-us
and describe your request as "Re:Opt-out".
13. HOW TO CONTACT US

    rights, our data privacy practices, this privacy notice, or any reports
    regarding suspected or actual security violations should be directed to our

This privacy notice may be revised periodically in our sole discretion, and
    any changes will be effective upon the revised privacy notice being posted
    to our Website or Application(s). You are solely responsible for reviewing

    event the last email address you provided is not valid or for any reason is
    not capable of delivering notifications to you, then in the event we
    provide you notification via email, our dispatch of the email containing
    such notification will constitute effective notification of the changes
    made to the privacy notice. In the event you do not wish to permit changes
    in our use of your personal information, you must notify us that you wish
    to deactivate your Account. Your continued use of the Website,
    Application(s), or Services following any changes to this privacy notice
    will indicate your acknowledgement of and consent to such changes and to be
    bound by the terms of such changes, with the understanding that the updated
    privacy notice applies to all of your personal information, including the
    personal information collected before the changes went into effect.
