” or “
work
” localizations, other “
favourites
”, car’s details, destinations you may travel to, search queries, if applicable. Also, when contacting our support, you provide us your email and name.
You may also provide additional information that will be used to personalize and enhance your experience with the Application. For example, if you provide us with your “

Information we collect as you use our Application
Karta collects non-personally-identifying information such as language preference, the date and time, and location of each visitor request. Karta’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Karta’s users use its application. From time to time, Karta may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Application.
We collect information about your activity in the Application, which we use to enhance it, including features which are meant to personalize your experience. This includes things like finding you the preferred route, proposing favourites or destinations commonly travelled by you to streamline your search and travel, and report of traffic incidents. The activity information we collect may include
:
Locations data and place information
Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (“Location Data”) and information about places (“Place Information”). Location Data reveals Karta where you currently are or you have been. Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as Assisted GPS. In many device models the user interface of the application identifies the use of positioning with an icon. Place Information is general information pertaining to particular geographical location (e.g., city or a location of a restaurant) that you may have provided to us. Unless otherwise stated, we use random identifiers in connection with your Location Data that do not identify you personally. When you start to use the application, it activates your selected positioning methods to retrieve your current location. The application may send your Location Data to Karta when you use location-enabled features of the application online, such as ask information about nearby suggestions, use search features. As further defined below, Location Data may be collected when you use the traffic feature for service improvement purposes without identifying you personally.
When this app is in use (or running in the background) we collect and share with our business partners (listed below under “Third Parties”) certain device and location data: Precise location data of the device, Wi-Fi signals or Bluetooth Low Energy devices in your proximity, device-based advertising identifiers, app names and/or identifiers, and information about your mobile device such as type of device, operating system version and type, device settings, time zone, carrier, and IP address.
That data may be used for the following purposes: (a) to customize and measure ads in apps and other advertising;(b) for app and user analytics; (c) for disease prevention (processing within the framework of the COVID-measures), and cybersecurity; (d) for market, civic or other research regarding aggregated human foot and traffic patterns, and (e) to generate proprietary pseudonymized identifiers tied to the information collected for the above purposes. For more details, please refer to the below section “How we use the information we have collected”. If you use the application in Belgium, we share, only after your prior consent, a small part of your location and trip data with the Flemish Road Authority (Agentschap Wegen en Verkeer). The shared location and trip data consists of a combination of location data (with departure buffer) and a unique session number. We do not share information that can be traced back to you directly (such as your name or email).
You may withdraw your permission of the above usages by accessing
Settings Menu
inside the Application, at any time, and from that moment on, no location and trip data will be shared anymore.
The Third parties that may collect such information used to identify you, are as listed:

We cooperate with third parties in some countries, such as local road authorities. In the case of a road authority, it receives specific information about traffic so that it can perform its services in a better manner (e.g. optimize traffic flows, better adjust traffic lights, etc.). You can help by sharing data.We only pass on this data if you give us your consent to do so. The transfer is limited to data that cannot be traced back to a user, such as location data, which are only linked to a unique session number. Thus, we do not provide account or payment information. In order to provide the data to that road authority, we ask you (on behalf of that road authority) for your prior consent. This way you keep maximum control over your data.
Traffic
When you use the traffic features of the application, Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp are sent from your device to Karta to detect traffic jams, traffic patterns, changed road conditions and other such conditions so that we can provide you with better service. This information is analysed to distinguish independent routes and traffic patterns and contains an identifier, which is persistent for the duration of the route. You may choose the extent to which you contribute to the improvement of our services. In the context of traffic features of the Service, you can provide us with the Location Data, speed, direction and timestamp, along with the changing identifier. This information is sent to us when you use the application online after which it is deleted from your device. We do not use this data to identify you personally.
Technical information and your transactions
When you use the Service online, certain technical information such as the type of your cellular device, unique device or network service provider identifiers, Internet Protocol address, time zone, technical details of your platform as well as your transactions with Karta may be automatically collected by Karta.
Device, application and service usage
This includes for example device model, operator, country, session and random, but persistent, identifiers in association with a particular event, for example start and stop events, menu accessed, feature selected or default value changed.
Aggregated Statistics
Karta may collect statistics about the behaviour of users to its application. Karta may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Karta does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as explicitly described in this Privacy Policy.
Error diagnostics
This includes information about error situations, for example which actions led to the error. However, no content, such as emails, SMS’s, documents, notes, search content, content of media files, exact location data (latitude and longitude) or any metadata which may be considered personal data or other such content is collected by the application.
How we use the information we have collected?
In the case of your personal data, we will process it only for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and if we have a legal basis for doing so.
The legal bases on which we rely are as follows:
Consent: your free consent, given after being informed of its implications.
Legitimate interest: a legitimate interest that we as an organisation have, for example, the optimization of our products and services delivered.
Legal obligation: a legal obligation to which we are subjected.
Karta may use information collected from or provided by you for the following purposes:
Improvement of products and services
The collected information helps us focus our improvement efforts to things that are most relevant to our users and to avoid error situations in the future. For example, Karta may use your route information to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data. For these purposes, we may use information collected. If you use the application in Belgium, (see section “What information do we collect > Locations data and place information”) your location and trip date will only be used by road authorities to assess and improve traffic situations, optimize traffic lights, monitor and evaluate traffic flows and traffic situations.
Provision of the Services
The information collected by the application is used to provide you with the service, to develop our products and services as well as to communicate with you. We may also use the information to provide you with more improved search and recommendations to better assist you to find a place you may like.
Location based advertising
The Application may include provision of location based advertising or other similar content. You may be positioned separately for this purpose. For example, if you ask for weather information you may be served with advertising content tailored to that location. The Application may also include behaviourally profiled advertisements. For the purposes of provisioning relevant advertisements to you, we may share your device specific advertising ID to advertising networks. We use a third-party company called AdMob to deliver ads to you. The AdMob SDK collects information about your device while you use the application. This information may include, but is not limited to, your device identifier, model and related configuration (such as screen size), wireless communication operator, as well as IP address. In addition, we provide you with means to increase the relevance of the advertising you see in the app by sharing your location with the advertising network. If you wish to opt-out from behaviorally profiled advertising, you can always opt-out from your device settings. Note that in any case you may still receive ads, but just not profiled.
Performance measure
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyse data about your usage of the Application to do things like optimize product design. We also use the data we collected about the ads you view or interact with (e.g., click on) to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns and to provide them with aggregated reports. We may also use data to measure the effectiveness of Karta’s own marketing efforts on third party sites or platforms.
Communication with you
Your information is also used to send you updates, notices, announcements, users’ requests and additional information related to the Services, through push notifications.Karta may also use your information to conduct surveys and questionnaires; and if you contact our support, we may keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protection of Karta, its users, the public and for Legal reasons
Karta may also use and process your information and content, using different technologies to the following purposes:
To enforce the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy;
To comply with any applicable law and assist law enforcement agencies under any applicable law, when Karta has a good faith belief that Karta’s cooperation with the law enforcement agencies is legally mandated or meets the applicable legal standards and procedures;
To detect abuse and illegal activity; to detect and prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity theft and other illegal activities and misuse of the Services;
To handle breakdowns and malfunctions;
To take any action in any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and Karta, or between you and third parties with respect to, or in relation with the Services;
For purposes provided under this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use;
To help improve the safety and reliability of our Services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to security risks, and technical issues that could harm Karta, its users, or the public;
To create aggregated and/or anonymous data (where such data does not enable the identification of a specific user). See “How does Karta use aggregated information”, below;
Your consent will be asked for before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
How do we collect the information?
The application uses third-party software and services to collect and send information to Karta, as stated in the remaining sections of this Privacy Policy. Information sent consists of only a few kilobytes per instance.
How Karta uses aggregated information?
Karta may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including pseudonymization on location information), in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, to properly operate the Application, to improve the quality of the Application, to enhance your experience, to create new services and features, including customized services, to change or cancel existing content or service, and for further internal, commercial and statistical purposes (including advertising).
Karta may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Application, in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to the Services’ providers, partners and any other third party. For example, GPS information that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to map editors in an aggregated and/or anonymous form to help improve the map and solve map problems, traffic data may be provided to cities and local authorities, and aggregated ads analysis may be provided to advertisers
.
What are our information sharing practices?
We do not share the information collected by the application with independent third-parties, unless otherwise explained in our privacy policies. However, information collected of a particular third-party feature may be shared with the provider of that application or feature in aggregated non-identifiable form. Karta will not share your personal information with others, without your permission, except for the following purposes and to the extent necessary in Karta’s good-faith discretion:
As necessary for the facilitation and operation of the Services.
If Karta reasonably believes that you have breached the Terms of Use or is investigating potential breach of the Terms of Use, or believes that you abused your rights to use the Services, or performed any act or omission that Karta reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law, rules, or regulations. Karta may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement agencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;
If Karta is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to share or disclose your information;
In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and Karta, with respect to, or in relation with the Services;
In any case where Karta reasonably believes that sharing information is necessary to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Karta, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law, including to prevent imminent physical damage or damage to property;
To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;
If Karta organizes the operation of its Services within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or if Karta is acquired by, or merged into or with another entity, or if Karta enters bankruptcy, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;
To collect, store, hold and manage your personal information through cloud based or hosting services or a third party or a party affiliated or connected to Karta, as reasonable for business purposes, which may be located in the European Union and the U.S.A., potentially countries outside of your jurisdiction;
Karta may also share personal information with companies or organizations connected or affiliated with Karta, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies;
We work with other Google’s services (such as Google AdMob and AdSense) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Karta, Google, and websites & apps that partner with Google, we may share information with these services, such as a unique identifier for advertising (i.e., Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or similar technologies). For more information see section titled ‘Advertising campaigns’ under this Privacy Policy.
We also work with selected advertising and measurement services which help us understand how our users interact with ads served in our Application and in order to provide marketing, advertising and measurement services for Karta with respect to Karta’s own marketing efforts, by using and sharing devices’ identifiers (i.e., Advertising ID or similar technologies).
Personal information may also be shared with Karta’s trusted partners and service providers to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer services.
What safeguards are in place?
Information security is a top priority for us. Karta services are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. Karta has all the necessary technical and organisational measures in place to process safely your personal data.
We have implemented systems, applications and protocols to secure your information, to minimize the risk of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information, whether on your device or on our servers. For example, we review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.
Notwithstanding the fact that Karta takes great efforts to protect your personal information, all the measures described above are unable to provide absolute assurance. Therefore, Karta cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that Karta’s databases will be absolutely immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.
How long Karta retains the data collected?
Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data will be retained for longer periods of time when necessary. This section describes why we hold on to different types of data for different periods of time.
Information retained until you remove it -
such as your “Home, “work”, favourites, and other related information. We’ll keep this data in your Application until you choose to remove it and/or update it.
Data that expires after a specific period of time
– in some cases, you don’t need to actively delete your information as we set retention timeframes based on the reason for the data’s collection. For example, when you use the traffic features of the application we collect anonymous location data for real-time traffic. After 5 minutes all data shared is no longer real-time and valid and is therefore deleted from servers automatically.
Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes
– sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. For example, if Karta processes a payment for you, we’ll retain this data for longer periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes. Reasons we might retain some data for extended periods of time include:
Security, fraud & abuse prevention;
Financial record-keeping;
Complying with legal or regulatory requirements;
Ensuring the continuity of our services, and;
Direct communications with Karta.
Your personal data will only be processed for as long as necessary for the purposes stated in the section “How we use the information we have collected” to be fulfilled or, if applicable, until the moment you withdraw your consent. Please be aware that the withdrawal of your consent may mean that you are unable to use all or part of the Application.
Advertising Campaigns
Karta allows advertisers to run advertising campaigns on the Application. The information and advertisements that you see when accessing the Application may be targeted on the basis of your current Karta activity, such as your current location, your destination or contextual information based on your current drive session. For example: if you search for “restaurant” you may see an ad for a local restaurant. Depending on your settings, you may also see advertisements personalized to you based on:
Information we received from you (for example, your saved “Home” & “Work” addresses);
Past activity and search query history (for example, drives that appear in your drive list);
Information from our ad partners.
You can decide whether we’ll show you personalized ads or not through our Application Settings > Terms & privacy > Location data & Ads. Please note that turning Ads personalization off does not turn off ads but only their personalization.
Also note:
We don’t knowingly collect nor do we show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, if provided for any reason, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby coffee shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and share your phone number with the coffee shop.
As described under the above sections “How we use the information we have collected” and “What are our information sharing practices”, we work with other services (such as AdMob) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help advertisers, decide what ads to show on Karta, Google, and websites & apps that partner with Google, Karta may share information with these services such as a unique identifier for advertising (Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or similar technologies).
The Ads personalization control described above apply to personalized ads served by Karta on the Karta Application and they do not apply to ads served on third parties’ platforms, including on Karta’s behalf.
When you visit a third-party website from the Application, such third party may use cookies on your computer. The third party’s use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not to this Privacy Policy. If you wish to study the privacy policies of those third parties you should visit their services, or contact them directly.
The Application includes an internal messaging system which provides you the ability to receive marketing messages from us. You hereby agree that we may use the internal messaging system for the purpose of informing you regarding products or services, which may interest you.
It is clarified that we are not responsible for the content of said advertisements and the products delivered or services rendered thereby by third parties and you irrevocably and unconditionally agree that we shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result or in connection thereof.
Your choices
The application offers a variety of choices to allow you to control how your Location Data and other information are collected. You may use the application in offline or online mode. No Location Data or other information is sent to Karta if you only use the application in offline mode. In offline mode, your device will also not interact with the advertising networks. Note, that your device may nevertheless continue to store and have already stored information which may be sent to Karta as defined earlier in this document and if you have enabled traffic feature. Note also that you may still receive ads, in case such ads have been cached in the device prior to switching the device into offline mode.
You can switch positioning services on and off using your device settings. Device positioning settings also control Karta positioning services. If you configure your device such that you are not using any assisted positioning methods, Karta positioning services will also not be used. You can choose to share your location with advertising networks to provide you with more location-relevant advertisements. You can always turn this on and off in the app settings. You may also clear your recent searches and destinations from the local storage of the Service. Clearing local storage will also clear already synchronized recent searches in the next synchronization instance.
Data subject rights and compliance
If you want to exercise your privacy rights relating to the Application, you may contact Karta and our data protection office at
privacy@ndrive.com
and your request will be acted upon according to law and the privacy policies applicable. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data Transfers
Your personal data are essentially processed within the European Economic Area (EEA).
In order to process your personal data for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, we may also transfer your data to third parties processing them on our behalf outside the EEA.

adequacy decision
the European Commission or contractual safeguards.
We may transfer anonymised and/or aggregated data to third parties outside the EEA. If such a transfer occurs, we will make sure that there are safeguards in place to ensure the security and integrity of your data and all rights regarding your personal data that you have under applicable legislation.

OUTLOGIC PRIVACY NOTICE
*Please click
HERE
to opt-out of selling your data.
OUTLOGIC LLC a Virginia company (“OUTLOGIC” “we,” “us,” and “our”), provides data services to other companies and organizations, as further described in this privacy notice (“Privacy Notice.”).
This Privacy Notice explains how we collects, uses, stores, and shares personal information about individuals in two different contexts (we refer to such individuals as “you,” “your,” and “yourself”): (1) visitors to our website located at
www.outlogic.io
or (2) when we collect personal information from third parties such as mobile applications (“Apps”). This Privacy Notice also explains certain choices you may have regarding how we use this information about you, as well as rights you may have to access or correct the information we hold and use.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and would like to review your rights under the GDPR, please go to
Section 8
of this Privacy Notice. If you are a resident of California or Virginia or certain other states that have enacted privacy-specific consumer laws, you may review your data privacy rights under those types of state laws at
Section 10
of this Privacy Notice.
Please note that we do not use any precise location data to create or build consumer profiles or targeted audiences in connection with sensitive health based locations, nor do we permit our customers to do so. In addition, to further comply with specific state laws, we use commercially available information to assist in filtering out precise location data for sensitive health based locations in those states.
Below, we explain certain terms that we will use in this Notice that may make it easier to understand:
Advertising ID
: A unique alphanumeric string randomly assigned by operating system manufacturers to a Device. Examples of this include iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs.
Data Aggregators
: Third party data companies that provide data to Outlogic, including personal data and information.
Devices
: Internet-connected mobile devices such as Apple iPhones that use iOS or Samsung Galaxy devices that use Google’s Android OS.
IP Address
: a numeric address in a format that follows the Internet Protocol data rules and that is used to identify a computer, mobile phone, or other device connected to the internet.
Personal Information
: This Policy refers to “Personal Information” and “Personal Data” interchangeably, to mean the types of information/data that applicable laws that use those terms refer to. It includes, for instance, device identifiers, precise location data, name/address, email address, and other unique identifiers that can be associated with them.
Publishers:
Providers of Apps used by Users on Devices.
SDK, or Software Development Kit
: An SDK is a block of computer code that Publishers can integrate with their Apps to collect data, often useful (as in OUTLOGIC’s case) to the mobile advertising and data industries.
Services
: OUTLOGIC’s Services refer to the products and insights we create/provide using location data,
and using and providing IP Addresses
and/or Advertising IDs assigned by Device manufacturers, to companies for marketing and research purposes, for example, to enable their research and personalized advertising. The Services also refer to products and insights we provide using location data and/or Installation IDs assigned to Devices by certain Apps, to companies for research purposes, excluding marketing and personalized advertising. The Services also include the SDK and other similar technologies we may use to collect information.
Site
: Our website that you may visit at
http://www.outlogic.io/
.
Visitors
: Individuals who
visit our website or
choose to provide information directly to us via the OUTLOGIC website “Contact Us” form.
Server to Server App / Server to Server Partner
: OUTLOGIC sometimes partners with certain Publishers or other Data Aggregators, who (in each case) do not use the SDK in favor of sending us information they collect from their Apps using their own SDKs. In other cases, we may obtain the same kinds of information using server-to-server transfers instead of collecting information through SDKs.
System Location Services
: Device technologies that allow Apps to access information about your location (such as GPS coordinates).
Installation ID
: A unique alphanumeric string randomly assigned by certain Apps to a Device but which is not used for advertising purposes.
App Tracking Transparency/Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads
: Features on iOS or Android Devices that allow Users to disable, or limit Apps’ ability to access, the Device Advertising ID. On iOS phones, users who do not give Apps permission to track zeroes out the Advertising ID. On Android phones running Android 12 or newer, users whom Opt-Out of Interest Based Ads zeroes out the Advertising ID.
A. Summary: Who is OUTLOGIC?
OUTLOGIC is a platform for collecting, aggregating, licensing and managing data. In particular, we focus on the curation and use of high-quality location data to help provide insights to organizations of various kinds regarding patterns of peoples’ movements. Our platform assists a variety of businesses and organizations in understanding movement patterns and trends for purposes including marketing and advertising, financial research, market research, traffic and urban planning, smart cities, or educational purposes. Certain government entities or public health organizations may also use our platform, including for purposes of public health research and planning, information security, physical security, to prevent crime, or for civic and traffic planning. (Our specific data licensing practices may vary depending on geographic region).
2. What Types of Information Do We Collect?
A. Information We Collect Through Our Services
We collect information using our SDK. This information may include Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, location information (described more fully below), and other information pertaining to the way Devices and their users engage with mobile advertising services. We also collect the same types of information using Server to Server transfers. We also collect information (including location information) from Publishers to assist them in meeting revenue goals for their Apps, allowing them to provide media, games, and other mobile apps, such as weather or traffic apps, without charging their users. We also may collect and use information from Apps owned by OUTLOGIC affiliated companies.
Publishers can use our SDK with their Apps in order to enhance advertisers’ ability to show ads in Publisher Apps (including to target more relevant ads and to measure ad performance). App Publishers may also work with us to monetize their App content in other ways we describe in this Privacy Policy. (If you would like to opt-out of our use of the Advertising ID on your Device for these purposes, please take the steps explained in
Section 6
below, entitled “User Choices and Opt-Out Tools”).
When you use an App or OUTLOGIC App on your Device that has integrated with our Services (including the SDK), we can collect certain information through or about your Device, if you have granted access to (and you have not later opted-out of our use of) location services and an Advertising ID or Installation ID. In particular (but not exclusively):
Precise Location Information
:
Specific geolocation of the Device, usually described by latitude-longitude coordinates compiled through GPS features of our SDK, WiFi connection information, cell tower triangulation and other methods.
Dwell time within or in proximity to points of interest (i.e. the length of time your device stayed at one place).
Relative Location Information
:
Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) sensors, or beacons,
Information obtained from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Near-field Communication (NFC)
Our SDK is capable of receiving signals from each of the above technologies that indicate the proximity of a Device. For example, certain brick-and-mortar stores use beacons that sense when a Bluetooth-enabled Device is in proximity to the beacon (i.e., when a Device user enters the store). Retail locations, sports arenas, restaurants, museums and other similar businesses may also use beacons.
Advertising IDs or Installation IDs
Timestamps
(that may include time and date)
Device Event Information
:
App or system crashes
System crashes
Device settings
Device Usage Information
Type of device (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S21)
Operating system (OS) information (e.g., iOS 14.5)
System settings (e.g., enabled/disabled status for Location Services)
Time zone
Mobile carrier
IP address
Names and/or identifiers for Apps on your Device integrated with SDK
Network Information
VPN status
Network protocols employed
Device connectivity information (e.g., how a device connects to a network) and signal strength
Network information such as mobile network code and mobile country code
B. Site Visitors

This information may include technical details about your computer or Device (such as the Device type, operating system, system settings and configurations, IP address, Advertising ID or other unique Device-based IDs, and mobile network carrier information) and information about how you use the Site (including details about the parts of the Site you access, traffic to and from other websites, timestamps, web log data, and other event information, including crashes and system activity). You may exercise control over this type of data collection by adjusting the settings on your device or browser (e.g., by disallowing cookies and using other similar settings).
Cookies:
We, along with our service providers and other vendors, may place cookies on our Visitors’ web browsers. You may view our full cookie policy
here
. We may use cookies for retargeting and other types of interest-based advertising, which you may limit by exercising the opt-out choices described in
Section 6
.
Web Beacons:
Web beacons or “pixels” are small, invisible webpage or email elements that may be used on the Site or in emails we send to you. We use them to deliver cookies, to count Site visits, to understand Site usage, to study the effectiveness of our advertising or marketing offers, and to learn whether you open an email or act upon it. You may limit this type of re-targeting and other types of interest-based advertising by exercising the opt-out choices explained in
Section 6
.
3. How We Use The Information We Collect Through Our Services
When we collect information through the Services, OUTLOGIC
or its customers who receive the data
may use it for any of the following purposes:
To Make Inferences based on collected data, including movement patterns and research
:
Movement Patterns
: To make inferences regarding the location and movement patterns of individuals or devices. For example, we might record location data from Devices at certain points of interest over time, like shows, sporting events, restaurants, etc., and we may include this information in the Services.
Data Products
: To use these location-based observations with other data products. For example, we may add other information to the location data we collect such as the name of a venue, time spent at a point of interest, or other information to a set of Advertising IDs or Installation IDs to enhance user profiles or to enable decision-making based on that information, such as executing a stock trade.
Advertising and Research
: For advertising and research purposes, such as use by advertising technology platforms who use the information to provide similar capabilities. The information helps these platforms to make predictions and generate insights about trends in consumer or market behavior, or to conduct scientific research in connection with human movement patterns.
Smart Cities and Security
: Real estate developers, urban planners, government entities, or security or smart city businesses may use and augment the information to tailor it to their needs. We also license the information to assist businesses and governments with planning, physical security, information security, and preventing crime.
Interest-Based Audiences and Targeting Ads
:
Interest-Based-Audiences
: We use the information we collect to organize Device users into audience segments based on their inferred interests (for example, that a Device user is interested in attending sporting events, or certain kinds of retail stores). This enables our Clients to deliver advertising to those users when they are recognized on their own platforms.
Targeting Ads
: By using audience segments, advertisers increase their chances of sending an ad that is more likely to be relevant.
Ad Measurement
:
Ad Measurement Analysis
: We use information we collect (such as location information and Advertising IDs) to assist advertisers with analyzing ad campaign performance – for example, by measuring how (or whether) Devices that were served with a particular ad engaged with the advertiser’s products or services. This is sometimes called ad measurement or attribution analysis.
An example of ad measurement analysis would be if certain Devices were served with an advertisement for “OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop” on Wednesday, and location data then showed traffic at OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop on Thursday or Friday was higher than average, OUTLOGIC Sandwich Shop might conclude that its ad campaign performed well.
Publisher Analysis
:
Analysis and Compliance
: We assist our Publisher partners with analyzing how Users engage with the Publishers’ Apps, and in activating that information for advertising, to generate revenue, and to enhance App functionality.
We may also use this information to provide Publishers with options for complying with certain laws, regulations, and other rules where applicable.
To learn more about how we collect, use and share information pertaining to our Site visitors, please refer to
Section 5
.
4. How Do We Use Information We Collect From Visitors?
We may use information we collect about Visitors for our corporate and internal purposes, including:
Analyzing what products and services Visitors may be interested in, the popularity of different pages of our Site, as well as how Visitors interact with our Site in other ways. If you give your personal contact information to us (e.g., your email address), we may combine that information with other information described in
Section 2
to understand how to better serve you.
To communicate with Visitors, including to offer customer or Visitor support for the Site or the Services. For example, we may use your personal information solely for purposes of replying to your questions when you use the “Contact Us” form on the Site.
Market research.
Direct and online targeted marketing in accordance with applicable law. For instance, we may “retarget” ads about our services to those who have visited our website.
To improve, maintain, operate, and personalize the Site.
For human resource purposes.
For any other legitimate purpose upon proper notice and/or consent.
5. With Whom Do We Share Information We Collect?
We share the information we collect for purposes of operating our platform (for example, with our service providers) and for purposes of supporting the business of our customers. We may share information we collect from your Device as follows:
With Our Customers
:
We share Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, Location Information, App Usage Data, and audience segments generated from those data points, with our customers (“Clients”).
Our Clients may include brand advertisers, data and technology platforms, advertising technology companies, and other organizations that study consumer behavior, provide tailored advertising, or study human movement patterns.
Like OUTLOGIC, some of these Clients may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options that the NAI offers (and requires its members to provide), please
see
https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. OUTLOGIC is not responsible for these Clients’ or any third parties’ privacy policies or opt-out programs or their compliance with NAI requirements.
With Our Service Providers
:
We have contracts with businesses that assist us with our own business operations (e.g., our Site, database hosting, fraud detection and prevention, verification and reporting, data hygiene, human resources, marketing and advertising, and email services), as well as billing or accounting functions, collections, technology, and other forms of operational support.
With Our Affiliates
:
In the event we establish a subsidiary or otherwise become affiliated with another company, we may share any information that we have collected with those entities.
In Relation to Legal Proceedings or Process
:
We may share information we have collected when we have a legal obligation to do so. This may include compliance with a binding court order, exercising, establishing or defending OUTLOGIC’s legal rights, or those of Clients or any other third party, or in good faith to comply with the requirements of any applicable law or legal process.
Similarly, we may disclose any information we have collected as required to respond in good faith to legal process, including subpoenas (whether civil or criminal), court orders or search warrants.
To Investigate Malfeasance and to Defend Ourselves or Third Parties
:
We may share information to assist us in enforcing our legal rights, our Terms of Service, or other policies as applicable, or to investigate any potential violation of the same. We may also share information to investigate any potential violations of the law, to defend or protect ourselves, our Clients, or any third party from any potential harm (whether tangible or intangible).
In Relation to a Corporate Transaction
:
If a third party seeks to acquire or actually acquires our business or assets in whole or in part, we may disclose information we have collected in connection to that transaction (including without limitation during due diligence that may be undertaken in advance of possible sales).
6. User Choices & Opt-Out Tools
You can manage the way that we use data collected passively from your Device in connection with the OUTLOGIC Site and the Services (e.g. Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, or cookies) as described below:
Browser Settings
: You may adjust the privacy and security settings of your web browser to change how your browser uses cookies.
Opting Out of Interest Based Advertising on Mobile Devices
: You can opt out of tailored advertising on mobile devices by companies that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting the NAI’s Mobile Choices Page and following the instructions provided there.
You can opt out of interest-based advertising on your browser by participating companies by visiting the
NAI’s opt-out page
or the
DAA’s Consumer Choice Page
. Residents of the EEA, UK and Switzerland may refer to
www.youronlinechoices.com
. The opt-out tools provided on these industry pages are generally based on cookie technologies. As such, if you delete your cookies (or change or update your web browser) you will need to repeat the opt out process. While our Services are generally not based on cookie technology, we are providing this information because we may partner with businesses to tailor ads for our own Services that do (for example, to retarget Visitors of Sites with advertisements). Further, certain third-party platforms may use information we have collected to match identifiers across devices – such as to tie a mobile Advertising ID by common IP Address to a browser-based cookie ID.
OUTLOGIC Opt-out:
You may limit the ways we use certain information we have collected by submitting an opt-out request by visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights

If you receive marketing or promotional emails from us, you may opt out of receiving those messages by following the “unsubscribe” instructions contained in them, or by emailing us with your request at
privacy@outlogic.io

7. Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect our physical infrastructure as well as in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks. These measures are intended to protect our systems (and the information contained therein) from loss, misappropriation, misuse, alteration or disclosure. No method of electronic transmission or storage is perfectly secure, however, so we cannot guarantee the security of information we collect with absolute certainty.

The European Union and UK and Protections Under European Privacy Laws (GDPR and UK GDPR)
We (and those using our Services) are required to provide certain information about the processing of “Personal Data” of users in EEA and Switzerland under the GDPR of users in the UK under the UK GDPR. For purposes of this explanation, we will refer to both as “GDPR.” “Personal Data” generally refers to data that identifies or is capable of identifying a particular user or Device. Names and addresses, cookie IDs, Advertising IDs, Installation IDs, precise location information, and biometric data are examples of “Personal Data.”
If you have any questions about OUTLOGIC’s processing of Personal Data in the context of the GDPR, You may contact our Chief Privacy Officer by emailing your questions to
privacy@outlogic.io
, or contact our EU Representative at
eurep@outlogic.io
.
The representations and information we provide below, which are applicable only to individuals located in the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, are provided for purposes of compliance with the GDPR. Please do not rely on the information below if you are not located in one of those regions.
Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data:
Under the GDPR, we must disclose the legal bases we rely on to process Personal Data. Our legal bases for processing Personal Data for the purposes we describe in
Section 2
and
Section 3
above and
Section 5
as to our corporate data) include:
Consent
. We rely on your consent to provide our Services that use precise location information related to other Personal Data. We also rely on your consent to store and access information on your Device (e.g., Advertising IDs and Installation IDs). Our reliance on consent is in turn often in reliance on compliance steps required of and taken by our data suppliers and by Clients that use the Services. These steps are intended to confirm that your consent is collected in compliance with the GDPR and passed on to Clients and business partners such that we only facilitate the collection of data in compliance with the law. We may rely on your consent to process Personal Data in other circumstances as well. When we do so, we will follow applicable laws pertaining to providing and withdrawing consent. We also attempt to obtain consent for certain of our clients to process Personal Data. These Clients, in turn, may be independent data controllers as to data in their own possession and control.
Legitimate interest
. We may rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data in some cases. We may do so when we use Personal Data for purposes of maintaining the security of our services (including to detect and prevent fraud or to facilitate the detection and correction of bugs or other errors). We also rely on legitimate interest when we use our own Clients’ Personal Data (or our Site Visitors’ Personal Data) to communicate with them about their use of our Services, or to analyze user activity on our Site.
Contractual Agreements
. In some cases our basis for processing Personal Data is that the processing is necessary pursuant to a contractual relationship we have entered into (such as records and contact information related to our Clients).
You may obtain a copy of our SCCs document by contacting us at
privacy@outlogic.io
.
Legal Obligations
. We may process Personal Data when it is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
Transfers of Personal Data:
When we collect Personal Data in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, and then transfer it outside of those jurisdictions, we take measures to ensure that such Personal Data is protected by appropriate safeguards. In general, our transfers of Personal Data rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and Data Processing Agreements to safeguard that data where the GDPR or other European data protection laws require it. You may use the contact information below to request a copy of these SCCs.
How We Retain Personal Data
: We generally retain Personal Data we collect for as long as is necessary to either (1) provide our Services (absent a deletion or opt-out request); or (2) for other purposes including compliance with our legal obligations, dispute resolution, and to enforce our contracts. Our schedule for retaining Advertising IDs, Installation IDs,
and related location data
is as follows: Advertising IDs and Installation IDs we collect in order to provide our Services are rendered inactive by us within 12 months after the time we last obtained your consent; however, we may retain data beyond 13 months where we have de-identified it (i.e., altered it in such a way that it cannot be linked to Personal Data). We may retain this (and other) information insofar as we have a legal or operational need to do so, for example, for purposes of auditing, corporate record-keeping, legal compliance, accounting, security and bug-prevention purposes.
Rights of Data Subjects:
Data Subjects have certain rights in connection with the Personal Data that data controllers process about them pursuant to the GDPR. These include the right to access Personal Data, the right to request correction of inaccurate Personal Data, the right to request the restriction of processing of Personal Data, the right to request deletion of Personal Data, and the right to object to processing of Personal Data (including when we process Personal Data to build a profile for targeted digital advertising). We describe these rights more fully below.
Right to Access
: You may contact us at
privacy@outlogic.io
in order to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller. We will respond to your request by explaining the steps you must follow to access your Personal Data after we receive your request. Because we are required to verify the identity of the individual making a request before we provide access to Personal Data, we will evaluate requests to exercise certain rights to access Personal Data on a case-by-case basis. In conducting this evaluation, we may consider both (1) the effort involved in verifying whether Personal Data that we process actually pertains to the data subject making the request – and only to that data subject; and (2) any potentially negative consequences that may result from erroneously releasing Personal Data to an individual other than the data subject, in light of the sensitivity of the Personal Data at issue and the degree of certainty we can achieve through verification. We may also limit the amount or kind of Personal Data we will release in circumstances where we believe it is likely that the improper release of Personal Data would adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the data subject. We will only honor requests for access to Personal Data for which we act as a data controller, as explained more fully in sub-section (d) below. Where we act as a processor for Personal Data on behalf of another entity (for example, our Clients), you may contact that company instead of OUTLOGIC to make a data access request.
Right to Correct
: You may exercise your right to correct Personal Data by contacting us using the contact information provided below.
Right to Withdraw your Consent or Object to our Personal Data Processing
: You may use the opt-out methods described in
Section 6
of this Privacy Notice to withdraw your consent for our processing of your Personal Data (when we are relying on your consent). If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your Personal Data in connection with our Services within 30 days or fewer.
Right to Request Deletion
: You have the right to request that we delete Personal Data concerning you that we process as a controller. If you use the opt-out process described above, we will also delete your Personal Data. You may also contact us at
privacy@outlogic.io
to request that we delete your Personal Data. We will provide further instructions on how you can exercise your right to deletion after we receive your email request. In certain circumstances we may keep copies of Personal Data in back-up files (or otherwise in inactive form), for certain of our internal purposes that are important to our business, including legal, auditing, accounting and billing, bug-detection and correction. We may keep such backups for as long as is necessary to fulfill those purposes.
Right to Make Complaints
: You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our processing of Personal Data with a relevant data protection authority. If you have a complaint, please contact us first to allow us to assist you in resolving it.
OUTLOGIC may act as either a data controller or a data processor in connection with the Personal Data we process, depending on the circumstances. EU data protection law distinguishes between companies that process Personal Data for their own purposes (i.e. “data controllers”) and companies that process Personal Data on behalf of and at the direction of other organizations (i.e. “data processors”). When we act as a data processor for other organizations, such as for our Clients, we may direct your requests or inquiries to the relevant data controller that is responsible for the processing of your Personal Data.
9. Children’s Data
We do not intend for our Services to be used in connection with minors under the age of 18, and we do not intentionally collect data from them. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected of any such data, please use the contact information provided in
Section 12
below to let us know.
10. Additional Information for U.S. Residents Including Residents of California, Montana, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and other States with Applicable Privacy Rights
US residents have data deletion rights as described in this
Section 10
. In addition, California residents have certain privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”), and Virginia residents have similar privacy rights under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act of 2019 (“VCDPA”), with respect to personal information or personal data about them. Residents of Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have similar rights under either the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA” effective July 1, 2023), the
Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring
(“CTDPA” effective July 1, 2023), or the Utah
Consumer Privacy Act
(“UCPA” effective December 31, 2023).
A number of other states’ residents have or will have similar protections at various times beginning in 2024 and 2025. We refer in this section to all states with privacy laws relevant to the below rights and disclosures as “Applicable States”).
A useful guide map to consult as to what privacy laws exist in your state is located at
http://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/
. (we are not responsible for the content in that tracker, which is not ours but rather is provided by a third-party organization.)
Under the CCPA “Personal Information” generally means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Similarly, under the VCDPA
and other state privacy laws
, “Personal Data” means any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. When we use the term “personal information” in the following sections, we mean your personal data or information under the CCPA if you are a California resident or your Personal Data under the
under the laws of other Applicable States
.
If you are a resident of the US including any of
the Applicable States
, this section of the Privacy Notice applies to you insofar as we have collected personal information about you, or have sold such information.
As required by the CCPA and VCDPA, and the other Applicable States laws when they become effective, describe the personal information we collect about residents of US states, and the purposes for which we may use it, in the following sections:

We provide information for purposes including financial and market research, for the study movement patterns, for urban planning, for smart cities research, or for educational purposes. We may also share information with government entities or public health organizations who wish to study movement patterns for disease prevention research, for physical security or defense purposes or information security, to prevent crime, or for civic, disaster and traffic planning.
To Operate Our Services
: We use personal information to:
Enhance, test, update, and verify our own data and data-related services
Develop new products or services
Operate, analyze, enhance, and secure our services
Other Internal Business Purposes
:
We use personal information for internal research or operations, auditing, detecting and responding to security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance. Information we collect from our Sites and from Apps may be used for the above, in addition to our own marketing purposes.
Sharing for Purposes of Legal Compliance:
We may share personal information with third parties for purposes of: (1) compliance with official legal process or a regulatory investigation (for example, a valid subpoena or court order); (2) enforcing our Terms of Service, this Privacy Notice, or other agreements, including investigation of suspected violations of the same; (3) responding to claims that certain content violates the rights of third parties; or (4) protecting the rights, property or personal safety of us (or our platform), our Clients, our affiliates, our agents, our platform users, or the general public. Similarly, we may share personal information with other entities to detect or prevent fraud, to prevent spam or malware, or other similar purposes.
Sharing In Connection With a Corporate Transaction:
In the event of a major corporate transaction (such as a merger, investment, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, or sale of some or all of our assets), we may share personal information in connection with that transaction, including for purposes of associated due diligence.
Sharing With Our Service Providers:
We may share any personal information we collect with our service providers.

We may use personal information to create aggregate information, or may de-identify any personal information we collect to make it such that it cannot be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate or De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate or De-Identified Information for any purpose, including, but not limited to, for research and marketing purposes. We may also share Aggregate or De-Identified Information with third parties, who may include advertisers or marketers, promotional partners, our sponsors, or otherwise at our discretion.
C. Rights and Choices of US States Residents
If you are a resident of any US state, you have the right to request that we delete personal information collected from you, including data that may reveal your mobile device’s precise geographic location, and also send requests to any recipients of your personal information that they delete such data from their commercial databases (your “deletion rights”). If you choose to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which we may nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as to prevent, detect, or investigate data security incidents, or to protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity directed at the company. The right to delete is separate from the right to opt-out of data sales as provided in Applicable States laws. We describe below how you may exercise your deletion rights.
In addition to data deletion, if you are a resident of an Applicable State, you may have
additional rights including
the right to request (1) that we disclose what personal information we collect from you; and (2) to opt out of our sale of your personal information. The states that provide these rights to their residents include but are not limited to California (under the CCPA), Colorado (under the CPA), Connecticut (under the CTDPA), Utah (under the UCPA), and Virginia (under the VCDPA),
as well as other Applicable States, as we have stated above.
These rights are subject to certain limitations, although you will not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. In certain circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee to process your request to the extent permitted by law.
Right to Opt-out of the Sale of Your Personal Information
:
Residents
of Applicable States
may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. “Sale” is defined broadly by
various state laws,
to include making personal information available in exchange for any monetary or other valuable consideration.
To “opt out” of our “sale” of your personal information you may use either of the methods below:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
By emailing your opt-out request to
privacy@outlogic.io
using a subject line that reads “Data Transfer Opt out.”
Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
:
If we have collected personal information from you, you may request that we delete such personal information. A request to delete is distinct from a request to “opt out” of our sale of your personal information. You may contact us by email at
privacy@outlogic.io
or call us toll-free at +1 (866) 346-9602 to exercise this right.
If you choose to exercise your right to deletion, there are certain circumstances under which we many nevertheless retain personal information as permitted by law, such as:
To defend against fraudulent activity directed towards our business, systems, or users.
To detect and fix technical issues that affect existing system functions (e.g., for de-bugging).
As necessary for the protection of the free speech or other rights of us (or others).
To assist with law enforcement requests made pursuant to lawful process.
For certain scientific or historical research purposes.
For our own internal purposes, provided they are reasonably related to your relationship with us.
To comply with our legal obligations.
Please note that we require certain information in order to provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete that information, it may prevent you from being able to access or use our Services.
Opt-Out/Access/Deletion Requests Metrics-2024
From January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, we maintained processes to facilitate requests pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act. We received the following requests, and responded as follows:a. As to requests to know:
We received 10
We complied with 2
We denied 8, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
b. As to requests to delete:
We received 141
We complied with 8
We denied 133, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
c. As to requests to opt out of sale:
We received 543
We complied with 94
We denied 449, as the limited personal data collected is logged by a device ID. The requestor refused to provide the necessary device D despite the company’s follow up explanation and request.
Our median response time was 2 days. Our mean response time was 3 days.
d. We received an additional 24,800 requests by a purported third-party automated data deletion service. Such requests could not be processed, due to service’s failure to provide the necessary identifying information despite our repeated requests.
Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information
:
Applicable States may give their residents the right to request that we disclose both the categories and specific pieces of personal information that we collect, use, or sell. We will comply with data access requests if we can verify them to a legally sufficient degree. You may make such an access request by emailing us at
privacy@outlogic.io
with the subject line “Data Access Request” or by calling us toll-free at +1 (866) 346-9602.
We may be able to adequately verify access requests for certain information we have collected. However, in line with certain guidance provided by the California Attorney General, we do not provide location data in response to access requests due to the fact that we are not able to verify to a reasonably high degree of certainty that the location data we have collected pertains to the individual making such a request, or whether either an individual with custody of a device — or the person making the request — is the rightful owner of the device to which the information we hold pertains. For example, it is not uncommon for a person to be in possession of another person’s phone temporarily (for example, a partner, friend or work colleague’s mobile phone or tablet), whether or not such temporary possession is authorized. We take this approach in order to avoid a scenario where such a person in temporary possession of a phone might obtain potentially detailed and sensitive information pertaining to the phone’s owner through a request for access. We also believe California law compels us to avoid a scenario like this. In addition, a recent study found that roughly 50% of mobile phones were not password protected at all, making the possibility of such “spoofing” a tangible risk. Further, we do not have other, more conventional means to confirm the identity of a device’s true owner because for consumer privacy reasons we do not collect information such as name, address or email address that could be used to do so.
If you do not wish location data associated with your device to be used in the ways we describe above, we suggest that you make a request to opt out of sales of your information as detailed above. You can find complete information about how to exercise your right to opt out by visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
.
Our Collection of Sensitive Personal Information, and Your Rights to Limit Its Use
:
Certain Personal Information that we collect and sell, such as precise geolocation of a person, household, or device, is considered “Sensitive Personal Information” under the data privacy laws of California (CCPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), and Virginia (VCDPA)
and other Applicable States
. We obtain the right to use and share this information, through the consent methods described in our Privacy Policy. California residents have the right to require a business to limit the use of their Sensitive Personal Information to only certain internal business purposes specified in the CCPA.
To limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information, you may use either of the methods below:
By visiting this link:

here
.
By emailing your request to
privacy@outlogic.io
using a subject line that reads “California Limit SPI Use.”
How to Exercise Your Rights and Submit a Verifiable Consumer Request
:
To exercise
applicable privacy
rights or to learn more about how to do so, residents of those
Applicable
States may contact us using any of the following means:
By visiting this link:
Your Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Rights
By emailing your request to
privacy@outlogic.io
.
With respect to access or deletion requests, by calling us toll-free at: +1 (866) 346-9602.
In certain circumstances, we may not disclose some personal information to you in response to an access request where doing so presents too great a risk to you or our business. We may also withhold such information where we cannot verify your identity in connection to such personal information.
To learn about how to opt out of Tailored Advertising, please review and consider whether to use the industry opt-out mechanisms provided on the
NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) page
. We believe that opting out using these industry tools may be more efficient, faster, and more uniform compared to using manual opt out processes.
In the event we are not able to comply with your requests fully for any of the reasons described above, we will still explain the reasons why we could not fulfill your request. Certain consumers have the right to appeal our decision not to fulfill a request, and may do so by emailing our Chief Privacy Officer at
A
ppeals@outlogic.io
with the subject line “Privacy Choices Appeal”.
Right to Non-Discrimination
:
If you elect to exercise your rights
under the Applicable State, as described in this
Section 10
, we will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services for that reason.
Information Regarding Individuals Younger than 16 Years Old
:
Unless we have obtained legally sufficient consent to do so, we do not knowingly sell personal information pertaining to minors younger than 16 years old. In the event we learn that we have collected or sold personal information regarding such residents, we will take reasonable steps to remove such information from our database (or we will obtain any legally required consents).
Authorized Agents
:
You may exercise your rights described above under the
laws of Applicable States
, by designating an agent to make requests on your behalf. If you choose to designate an agent, we will take steps to verify both (1) your identity; and (2) that your designated agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf by providing us
(depending on the legal requirement in your state)
with a written authorization signed by you or a copy of a valid power of attorney.
D. Retention of U.S. Personal Information
We retain personal information pertaining to the categories listed in
Section 10
.A. on the following schedule: device and other identifiers, precise location data, inferences, and internet or other electronic activity information may be retained for up to 5 years, with certain aggregated information related to locations of devices and internal reporting data retained for up to 3 years, to fulfill the business purposes listed in Section II.B. We may maintain personal information for longer periods if we have a significant operational or legal need to do so, such as for auditing, compliance, accounting, security, bug-prevention purposes, and when required by law. For example, we may retain Consent audit logs
for up to 10 years
.
