CellarTracker! LLC (collectively “CellarTracker” or “we”, “us”, or “our”) is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information when you interact with the cellartracker.com website and mobile applications (“Sites”). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the kinds of information we may gather from your use of the Sites; why we gather your information; what we use your personal information for; when we might disclose your personal information; and how you can manage your personal information. We also include specific disclosures for residents of the European Economic Area, UK, and Switzerland, as well as California.
This Privacy Policy applies to CellarTracker’s websites, mobile applications, emails we send, as well as information we collect when you interact with us through our services and other websites.
By visiting the Sites, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites.  We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. Your continued use of the Sites and our affiliate websites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.  If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don’t see your concerns addressed here, you should contact us by email at

What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?
CellarTracker adheres to the highest standards of ethical practices in all of our operations and is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all visitors to the Sites.
Our Privacy Policy is simple: Except as disclosed below, we don't sell, barter, give away, or rent your personal information to any company outside of or not affiliated with CellarTracker.
Information You Give Us
The Sites include features or services that permit you to enter contact information and other information about you (“Information You Give Us”). We collect and store any information you enter on the Sites. This includes:
Information you may provide in connection with your creation of an account, including your First Name, Last Name, City, State, Email Address, and Username.
Information you provide in connection with making your subscription payment.
Information or data you provide by interacting in our online forum or by commenting on content posted on the Sites. The content, such as tasting notes, may be visible to other users of the Sites.
Information you provide when you interact with us via social media, including any posts, pictures, videos and messages which you submit to us either via our social media sites (including by use of hashtags associated with us) or the Sites.

If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence and any contact information provided.
CellarTracker does not process or store credit card information.
When you submit a subscription payment, members are connected with a third party online payment platform, Braintree Payments, which processes the credit card transaction and sends us confirmation of payment and limited details about your payment method. Braintree Payments uses industry-standard encryption and secure web pages for transmission of credit card information to keep your information secure, accurate, current, and complete. For more information on Braintree Payments, please visit their website.
Information We Collect Automatically
When you interact with the Sites, certain information about your use of the Sites is automatically collected. Much of this information is collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies, as well as through your web browser or device.  Any or all activities with regard to collecting usage information may be performed on our behalf by third-parties (see Additional Information About Third Party Cookies below). This includes:

These third parties will not be able to relate this data to identifiable individuals.

support@cellartracker.com
.
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “Personal Information,” as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit sharing of Personal Information. The CCPA defines “Personal Information” as “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.”
To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below. We do not engage in any disclosures that would be considered sales of data for California residents under the CCPA at this time.
Notice at Collection Regarding the Categories of Personal Information Collected
You have the right to receive notice of the categories of Personal Information we collect, and the purposes for which those categories of Personal Information will be used. The categories we use to describe the information are those enumerated in the CCPA.
Our practices regarding disclosure of your Personal Information are described below:
Personal Identifiers
:
We collect your name, the city and state that you live in, as well as your email address when you create an account or complete a transaction. If you create an account, you will also be asked to create a username, and we will assign one or more unique identifiers to your profile. We use this information to provide the Sites, respond to your requests, and send information about products, services, and promotional offers to you.
We collect your social media handle and basic account information when you interact with our Sites through social media.
You may submit payment information to us through our website, which may include your credit card number, when you complete a transaction. This information is transmitted directly to our payment card processor, and we do not store it.
We collect your IP address automatically when you use our Sites. We use this information to identify you, gauge online activity on our website, measure the effectiveness of online services, applications, and tools, and serve targeted advertisements based on your online activities.
We collect your device id automatically when you use our Sites. We use this information to monitor your use and the effectiveness of our Sites, to identify you, and to prevent fraud.
Commercial Information
: When you engage in transactions with us, we create records of goods or services purchased or considered, as well as purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of our Sites and to provide you with targeted information, advertisements and offers.
Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information
: We collect information about your browsing history, search history, and interactions with websites, and/or applications advertisements automatically when you utilize our Sites. We use this information to gauge online activity on our website, measure the effectiveness of online services, applications, and tools.
Geolocation Data
: As described above, we collect your IP address automatically when you use our Sites. We may be able to determine your general location based on the IP address. We do not collect your precise location (e.g., your GPS coordinates).
We may use any of the categories of information listed above for other business or operational purposes compatible with the context in which the Personal Information was collected, as described in the How We Use and Share Your Information section above.
Right to Know About Personal Information Disclosed or Sold
You have the right to request that we disclose to you the Personal Information we disclose or sell.
We may share any of the above-listed information with Service Providers, which are companies that we engage for business purposes to conduct activities on our behalf. Service Providers are restricted from using Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. The categories of Service Providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described in our Privacy Policy above in the section titled “Third-Party Agents.”
To “sell” information means to disclose it to a company for monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party either because the purpose of sharing is not an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because our contract does not restrict them from using Personal Information for other purposes. We do not engage in any disclosures that would be considered sales of data for California residents under the CCPA at this time.
Right to Know/Access Information
You have the right to request access to Personal Information collected about you and information regarding the source of that information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we share it. You may submit such a request as described below. To protect our customers’ Personal Information, we are required to verify your identify before we can act on your request.
Right to Request Deletion of Information
You have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete Personal Information that we have collected directly from you. You may submit such a request as described below. To protect our customers’ Personal Information, we are required to verify your identify before we can act on your request. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request, or why we may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.
How to Submit a Request
You may submit a request to exercise your rights to know/access or delete your Personal Information through one of two means:
By emailing us at
support@cellartracker.com
By requesting to delete your account from the
Edit Profile
page (website) or
Profile page
(mobile).
Verification Procedures
In order to process your request to know/access or delete Personal Information we collect, disclose, or sell, we must verify your request. We do this by asking you to:
send us an email from the email address associated with your account; or
confirm your request using the email address associated with the account stated in the request.
Authorized Agent
You may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf. We require the authorized agent to provide proof that you have authorized them to act on your behalf.
Changes to This Policy
We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes, and such changes will become effective when they are posted. Your continued use of the Sites following the posting of any changes will mean you accept those changes.
We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use the Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.  We will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information we have previously collected without your express consent.

Residents of the State of California have the right to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please send an e-mail to
support@cellartracker.com
.
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “Personal Information,” as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit sharing of Personal Information. The CCPA defines “Personal Information” as “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.”
To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below. We do not engage in any disclosures that would be considered sales of data for California residents under the CCPA at this time.
Notice at Collection Regarding the Categories of Personal Information Collected
You have the right to receive notice of the categories of Personal Information we collect, and the purposes for which those categories of Personal Information will be used. The categories we use to describe the information are those enumerated in the CCPA.
Our practices regarding disclosure of your Personal Information are described below:
Personal Identifiers
:
We collect your name, the city and state that you live in, as well as your email address when you create an account or complete a transaction. If you create an account, you will also be asked to create a username, and we will assign one or more unique identifiers to your profile. We use this information to provide the Sites, respond to your requests, and send information about products, services, and promotional offers to you.
We collect your social media handle and basic account information when you interact with our Sites through social media.
You may submit payment information to us through our website, which may include your credit card number, when you complete a transaction. This information is transmitted directly to our payment card processor, and we do not store it.
We collect your IP address automatically when you use our Sites. We use this information to identify you, gauge online activity on our website, measure the effectiveness of online services, applications, and tools, and serve targeted advertisements based on your online activities.
We collect your device id automatically when you use our Sites. We use this information to monitor your use and the effectiveness of our Sites, to identify you, and to prevent fraud.
Commercial Information
: When you engage in transactions with us, we create records of goods or services purchased or considered, as well as purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of our Sites and to provide you with targeted information, advertisements and offers.
Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information
: We collect information about your browsing history, search history, and interactions with websites, and/or applications advertisements automatically when you utilize our Sites. We use this information to gauge online activity on our website, measure the effectiveness of online services, applications, and tools.
Geolocation Data
: As described above, we collect your IP address automatically when you use our Sites. We may be able to determine your general location based on the IP address. We do not collect your precise location (e.g., your GPS coordinates).
We may use any of the categories of information listed above for other business or operational purposes compatible with the context in which the Personal Information was collected, as described in the How We Use and Share Your Information section above.
Right to Know About Personal Information Disclosed or Sold
You have the right to request that we disclose to you the Personal Information we disclose or sell.
We may share any of the above-listed information with Service Providers, which are companies that we engage for business purposes to conduct activities on our behalf. Service Providers are restricted from using Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. The categories of Service Providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described in our Privacy Policy above in the section titled “Third-Party Agents.”
To “sell” information means to disclose it to a company for monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party either because the purpose of sharing is not an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because our contract does not restrict them from using Personal Information for other purposes. We do not engage in any disclosures that would be considered sales of data for California residents under the CCPA at this time.
Right to Know/Access Information
You have the right to request access to Personal Information collected about you and information regarding the source of that information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we share it. You may submit such a request as described below. To protect our customers’ Personal Information, we are required to verify your identify before we can act on your request.
Right to Request Deletion of Information
You have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete Personal Information that we have collected directly from you. You may submit such a request as described below. To protect our customers’ Personal Information, we are required to verify your identify before we can act on your request. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request, or why we may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.
How to Submit a Request
You may submit a request to exercise your rights to know/access or delete your Personal Information through one of two means:
By emailing us at
support@cellartracker.com
By requesting to delete your account from the
Edit Profile
page (website) or
Profile page
(mobile).
Verification Procedures
In order to process your request to know/access or delete Personal Information we collect, disclose, or sell, we must verify your request. We do this by asking you to:
send us an email from the email address associated with your account; or
confirm your request using the email address associated with the account stated in the request.
Authorized Agent
You may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf. We require the authorized agent to provide proof that you have authorized them to act on your behalf.
Changes to This Policy
We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes, and such changes will become effective when they are posted. Your continued use of the Sites following the posting of any changes will mean you accept those changes.
We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use the Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.  We will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information we have previously collected without your express consent.

Functionality
Functionality cookies allow the Platform to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features.

We sometimes use cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Platform.

Information on this is available from us upon request.
Data Privacy Framework
Adjust Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Adjust Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, Adjust Inc. commits to cooperate and comply with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF.

2. Tracking Technologies on our Website
Google Analytics
We use the Google Analytics service of the provider Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland on our website.
Google Analytics is a web analytics service that allows us to collect and analyze data about the behavior of visitors to our website. Google Analytics uses cookies for this purpose, which enable an analysis of the use of our website. This involves processing of personal data in the form of online identifiers (including cookie identifiers), IP addresses, device identifiers and information about interaction with our website.
Some of this data is information that is stored in the terminal device you are using. In addition, further information is also stored on your end device via the cookies used. Such storage of information by Google Analytics or access to information that is already stored in your terminal device only takes place with your consent.
Google Ireland will process the data collected in this way on our behalf in order to evaluate the use of our website by the users, to compile reports on the activities within our website and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our website and the use of the internet. In doing so, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.
The personal data processed on our behalf to provide Google Analytics may be transferred to any country in which Google Ireland or Google Ireland's sub-processors maintain facilities. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries".
In addition to the option to reject Google Analytics in our Consent Banner, you can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google Ireland within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the IP address be transferred to Google on a server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other data. You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
We use the Google Analytics 4 variant, which allows us to track interaction data from different devices and from different sessions. This allows us to put individual user actions in context and analyze long-term relationships.
The data about user actions are stored for a period of 14 months and then automatically deleted. All other event data is stored for 2 months and are then automatically deleted. Thereby, the deletion of the data whose storage period has expired takes place automatically once a month.
Google Ads
We use the online advertising program Google Ads of Google Ireland, Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”) on our website, through which we place advertisements on the Google search engine. When you access our website via a Google ad, Google sets a cookie on your terminal device ("conversion cookie"). In the process, a different conversion cookie is assigned to each Google Ads customer, so that the cookies are not tracked across the websites of different Ads customers. The information obtained with the help of the cookie is used to create conversion statistics. This tells us the total number of users who clicked on one of our Google ads. However, we do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified. When using the service, a transfer of your data to the USA cannot be excluded. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries". You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
Google Remarketing
We also use the Google Analytics advertising features (remarketing) from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This function enables us, in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google, to display advertisements in a more targeted manner and to present users with ads that are tailored to their interests. Via the remarketing, users are shown ads and products for which interest has been identified on other websites in the Google network. The function allows us to link advertising target groups created via Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device functions of Google Ads. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to a user depending on previous usage and surfing behavior on an end device (e.g. cell phone) can also be displayed on another end device of the user (e.g. tablet or PC).
If you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history with your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be placed on every end device on which you log in with your Google account. The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based solely on your consent, which you can give or withdraw at Google. For these linked services, data is then collected via Google Analytics for advertising purposes. To support the remarketing function, Google Analytics collects users' Google-authenticated IDs, which are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data. This is used to define and create target groups for cross-device ad advertising.

.
Google Signals
We use the Signals feature of Google Analytics, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Signals recognises individual users using different devices (so-called cross-device tracking). We only receive anonymous data in the form of a report that shows patterns in user behaviour. Google Signals helps us to better understand how visitors interact with our website and to show more meaningful and personalized ads to these visitors after leaving our website.
For this, session data is being processed and linked with website visitors that
• have a Google account;
• are logged in to their Google account when they access the corresponding website; and
• have turned on the “Ads personalization” feature in their Google account.

Transactions Involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings.

Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services.

Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
