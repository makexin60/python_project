Autodesk Privacy Statement
Effective date: January 1, 2025
Protecting your privacy is important to Autodesk. This Privacy Statement explains how Autodesk processes personal data collected through websites, products, and services (“applications”), including those distributed by our resellers and other channel partners, and through in-person and digital events, webinars, surveys, marketing activities, and visits to our premises (along with applications, collectively our “offerings”). References to “Autodesk,” “we,” or “our” means Autodesk, Inc. and other entities that belong to the Autodesk corporate family and that link to this Privacy Statement. A list of entities within the Autodesk corporate family can be found
here
.
We may display just in time privacy notices on occasion, such as when we believe on-the-spot transparency would help you make an informed choice about whether to provide personal data. For example, you may see a just in time privacy notice explaining a particular data collection program, or you may see a just in time privacy notice when registering for an event.
This Privacy Statement describes how we process personal data for our own purposes. We also process personal data on behalf of our customers subject to a written contract. We do not control the data processing or protection practices of our customers, which may differ from those set out in this Privacy Statement.
Our Privacy Statement applies only to data collected by Autodesk. We may provide links to third-party websites, but we are not responsible for their privacy practices. When you click on these links, you will be subject to the privacy practices of those websites. We encourage you to review their privacy statements before providing any information.
“Personal data” is information that identifies, or can reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to, an identifiable person. Personal data does not include information that is anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated, as those terms may be defined under applicable law. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, “personal data” and “personal information” have the same meaning and are used interchangeably. In some jurisdictions, publicly available information is also not considered personal data, and this Privacy Statement may not apply in those cases.
What information does Autodesk collect about you?
We obtain personal data in different ways. Some personal data is collected directly from you. Other data is automatically collected or generated about how, when, and why you interact with us through our offerings, including data obtained through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.

Cookie Statement
.
Except as described in our Privacy Statement and our Cookie Statement, whether we collect data through the use of Cookies is up to you.

If you use one of our offerings that contains Plugins, information can be transferred directly from your device to a third-party provider of services and/or platforms. We may not control the data collected by Plugins. If you are logged into a social network, the social network may be able to link your use of our offerings to their services and/or platform.
For example, if you interact with a Plugin by clicking on "Like," "Follow," or "Share," or by writing a comment, this information may automatically appear in your profile on the relevant social network service or platform. Even if you are not logged in, the Plugins may send your IP address to social network services and/or platforms. Please note this when using our offerings.
When you connect to a social networking service or platform on a device that is also used by others, these other users may be able to see information that is stored or displayed in connection with your profile on the social networking service page.
Information we collect from other parties:
We receive and process information from our affiliates and from third-party sources, including employers, business partners, business contact databases, enrichment services, channel partners (e.g., resellers), marketing service providers, third-party data aggregators, and social networking services and platforms (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook). We also receive information from publicly available sources and licensors. The categories of personal information we collect from these sources include:

Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the contact details below or as otherwise indicated to you in writing. Please note that your withdrawal of consent will not affect our processing activities based on your consent that occurred before your withdrawal.
Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal information, we balance your rights against ours so that our interest is not overridden by the interests you have to protect your information. You may also have the right to object to that processing on the basis of circumstances specific to you. For more information, see “
What Rights and Choices Do You Have?
” below.
When we process personal data about you to comply with legal requirements or to perform our obligations under a contract with you or with our customer through whom you use our offerings, failure to provide such data may prevent or delay our fulfillment of these obligations.

What are Autodesk’s storage and data retention practices?
We store your personal data and content on our servers and the servers of our service providers. Because we and our service providers maintain servers in global locations, your personal data may be transferred across national borders and stored on the servers outside of your country or region. We will retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary or permitted and proportionate to the purpose for which it was collected. For example, to provide you with the offerings that you are using or have requested, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and as needed to comply with our legal obligations. The criteria that we use to determine our retention period include the duration of our relationship with you, nature and sensitivity of the processed data, whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data, the risk of harm from unauthorized disclosure of data and whether the purpose of processing can be achieved by other means. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time. As described further below, you have the ability to delete information from your account at any time. There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize or de-identify your personal data due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance or other operational reasons.
Does Autodesk transfer your personal data across national borders?
Because Autodesk is a global company, we transfer personal data across national borders to other countries, in compliance with the laws that apply to that data.  For example, if your data is transferred from one of our entities in the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States, or to another country outside of the EEA that does not provide adequate protection for personal data, as determined by the European Commission, we rely on our EU Binding Corporate Rules  approved by the Irish Data Protection Commission in May 2023, which you can find on our website
here.
If your data is transferred from one of our entities in the United Kingdom or in Switzerland to a country that does not provide adequate protection for personal data (as determined by UK and Swiss Data Protection Laws) we rely on the legal mechanism of Standard Contractual Clauses for such transfers.
Autodesk complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (‘EU-U.S. DPF’), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, European Commission, UK Government, and Swiss Federal Administration regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, and their related principles (the "Data Privacy Framework Principles"). Autodesk has certified to the U.S. International Trade Administration, within the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern.
In compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, Autodesk commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this policy should first contact at:
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
.
Autodesk has further committed to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution-American Arbitration Association
(“ICDR-AAA”), an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the ICDR-AAA DPF independent recourse mechanism. The services of ICDR-AAA are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may have the possibility to engage in binding arbitration to resolve residual disputes. For more information on this option, please see Annex I of the Data Privacy Framework Principles.
Autodesk’s commitment to subject the personal information described in this Policy to the Data Privacy Framework is subject to the enforcement and investigative powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
Autodesk may share personal information with third parties under certain circumstances described above. Autodesk’s obligations under the Data Privacy Framework Principles extend to third parties acting as agents who help us run our business and provide services, and Autodesk remains liable should a third party acting as our agent process personal information subject to this Policy in a manner inconsistent with this Policy, except where Autodesk is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
What are Autodesk’s marketing and advertising practices?
We use analytics tools and also work with one or more advertising networks and digital advertising partners (our “Ad Partners”) that use Cookies to collect information about application visitors, to serve ads, and to help us track results of advertising and marketing campaigns. Partners of our Ad Partners may also use Cookies to collect information from you for these purposes. Through these means, we and/or our Ad Partners and their partners may be able to collect information from application visitors, including websites visited, how and when applications are used, marketing preferences, IP addresses, device IDs, and browser information. This information is used to display personalized advertising in websites and other applications, to calculate and control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, to deliver ads that relate to a visitor’s interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. We process your personal data for the above activities in furtherance of our legitimate interests or, where required, with your consent.
You can opt out of the use of your information by certain Ad Partners for online behavioral advertising by using the Digital Advertising Alliance’s
Your AdChoices
tool. The Your AdChoices tool may not work if your browser does not accept third-party Cookies, and if you delete Cookies, use a different browser, or use a different computer, you will need to use the tool again to renew your opt-out.
If you reside in the U.S., please see what additional rights you might have in the "Privacy Rights under U.S. Privacy Laws" section below.
As described above, you can change your Cookie preferences. Cookie choices are generally application-, browser-, and device-specific, so you may need to refresh your choices if you visit a different application, use a new browser or device, or clear your browser’s cookies.
How does Autodesk protect children and student data?
At Autodesk, we care deeply about children’s privacy and protecting their data.
Most of our applications are made for the general public and are designed for adult users. We refer to these applications as “general interest applications.” We do not knowingly collect personal data from children in connection with general interest applications. If you become aware of any unauthorized submission of children's personal information to Autodesk, please inform us by contacting us using the contact information listed below so that we may conduct the necessary investigation which may result in deletion of the data.  Certain applications are appropriate for and are intended for use by children. We refer to these applications as “Children’s applications.”
Our
Children’s Privacy Statement
applies to personal data collected from certain child and student users of Autodesk offerings, including Children's applications. If there is a conflict between our Children’s Privacy Statement and our Privacy Statement, the Children’s Privacy Statement sets the standard for how we process children’s personal data. For more information, please refer to our
Children’s Privacy Statement
.
Is the personal data you give us ever displayed publicly?
As always, we urge you to be mindful when deciding to disclose personal data, including on our offerings. Our offerings may allow you to post content, including comments and “likes,” that can be visible to the public.
In some cases, you can limit who can view or access the information and content you post. In other cases, the information and content might be available to registered members of the offering, or even to the general public. Your name, username, profile image, or email address (particularly if this is your username) may be posted along with any message or other content you post through some of our offerings.
If you are posting information you do not want to be disclosed publicly, make sure you are using an offering that allows you to control who sees information you have posted.
Will this Privacy Statement change?
We may change this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in the law, our data handling practices, or the features of our business. The updated Privacy Statement will be available at our Trust Center
here
. We will show the date the Privacy Statement was last updated to help you know when we change it. If we make material changes to our Privacy Statement, we will endeavor to provide you with notice before such changes take effect, such as through prominent notice on our website or services or by email.

Privacy Rights under U.S. Privacy Laws
We described several types of rights in
“What Rights and Choices Do You Have?”
above.
If you reside in California, you may have the following rights:
right to access
the specific pieces of your information that we have collected about you in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format;
right to know
details about our processing of your information;
right to request deletion
of your personal information;
right to correct
inaccurate data in certain circumstances;
right to opt-out of sales of personal information and the sharing of your personal information for cross context behavioral and targeted advertising;
and
the right to non-discrimination
(e.g., to not be denied goods or services for exercising your rights).
To the extent applicable, you also have the right to limit the use and disclosure of any "sensitive personal information, according to the legal definition of what constitutes sensitive personal information."
California law treats certain disclosures of personal information with third parties in exchange for something of value as “sales,” even when no money changes hands. Autodesk does not exchange your personal information for money. However, some of the technologies we use to provide our offerings involve transfers of personal information that may be considered a “sale” under California law. In addition, California consumers have the right to opt out of the “sharing” of their information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
You may exercise these rights by going to
www.Autodesk.com
and clicking on Do Not Sell or Share link provided at the bottom of the page. You may also opt out of these transfers by submitting
this form
or by emailing us at
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
.
You can exercise the rights above by emailing us at
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
. To request a copy of the personal information in your account, you can also
submit this form
. To request deletion of your personal information, you can also
submit this form
. If you have an Autodesk account, you can edit and correct your personal information at any time by changing it in your account.
Except as described in this notice or provided under applicable privacy laws, there is no charge to exercise your legal rights. However, if your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may:
Charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or taking the action requested; or
Refuse to act on the request and notify you of the reason for refusing the request.
Please note that the above rights are not absolute, and we may be entitled to refuse requests in whole or in part, where exceptions under applicable law apply. For example, we may decline certain requests where the time and resources expended by us to honor the request significantly outweigh the benefit provided to the consumer.
We may need to verify your identity before completing your rights request. How we verify your identity depends on whether you hold an account with Autodesk:
Individuals with Autodesk accounts can verify their identity by logging into their account.
Individuals without Autodesk accounts (non-accountholders) need to provide information establishing their identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We may ask non-accountholders to provide information such as name, e-mail addresses, and information relating to their use of the Autodesk websites or other offerings.
Authorized Agents: Persons authorized to submit requests on behalf of a consumer (“agents”) can submit a request by email to
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
. We may notify the consumer and require the consumer to independently verify their identity with us and confirm that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the rights request before fulfilling the authorized agent’s request. This verification process is not necessary if your authorized agent provides documentation reflecting that the authorized agent has power of attorney to act on your behalf under Cal. Probate Code §§ 4121 to 4130. For additional information, please see our
U.S. Privacy Law FAQs for California
.
We will not respond to your data rights request until we are able to verify your identity or confirm the validity of an Authorized Agent request. For more information about authorized agent requests, please see
U.S. Privacy Law FAQs for California
.
We retain certain information relating to your CPRA request to demonstrate compliance with CPRA and to improve our consumer request process. We retain personal information that is reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purpose for which it was collected or for other disclosed and compatible purposes.
The following table provides a description of the personal information that we have disclosed for our business purposes, the personal information that we have sold or shared, and the categories of third parties that received the personal information.

Autodesk Privacy Statement
Effective date: January 1, 2025
Protecting your privacy is important to Autodesk. This Privacy Statement explains how Autodesk processes personal data collected through websites, products, and services (“applications”), including those distributed by our resellers and other channel partners, and through in-person and digital events, webinars, surveys, marketing activities, and visits to our premises (along with applications, collectively our “offerings”). References to “Autodesk,” “we,” or “our” means Autodesk, Inc. and other entities that belong to the Autodesk corporate family and that link to this Privacy Statement. A list of entities within the Autodesk corporate family can be found
here
.
We may display just in time privacy notices on occasion, such as when we believe on-the-spot transparency would help you make an informed choice about whether to provide personal data. For example, you may see a just in time privacy notice explaining a particular data collection program, or you may see a just in time privacy notice when registering for an event.
This Privacy Statement describes how we process personal data for our own purposes. We also process personal data on behalf of our customers subject to a written contract. We do not control the data processing or protection practices of our customers, which may differ from those set out in this Privacy Statement.
Our Privacy Statement applies only to data collected by Autodesk. We may provide links to third-party websites, but we are not responsible for their privacy practices. When you click on these links, you will be subject to the privacy practices of those websites. We encourage you to review their privacy statements before providing any information.
“Personal data” is information that identifies, or can reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to, an identifiable person. Personal data does not include information that is anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated, as those terms may be defined under applicable law. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, “personal data” and “personal information” have the same meaning and are used interchangeably. In some jurisdictions, publicly available information is also not considered personal data, and this Privacy Statement may not apply in those cases.
What information does Autodesk collect about you?
We obtain personal data in different ways. Some personal data is collected directly from you. Other data is automatically collected or generated about how, when, and why you interact with us through our offerings, including data obtained through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.

We also use cookies (small text files stored by your web browser when you use websites) and related technologies, such as pixels and beacons (collectively “Cookies”), to collect and store information when you use our applications. To learn more, see our
Cookie Statement
.
Except as described in our Privacy Statement and our Cookie Statement, whether we collect data through the use of Cookies is up to you. You can change your mind at any time by going into your application settings or by clicking a link in the footer of our websites.

Social Networking Data:
We may include content, pixels, tags, buttons, or other tools that link to another company’s services and/or platform(s) (“Plugins”). If you use one of our offerings that contains Plugins, information can be transferred directly from your device to a third-party provider of services and/or platforms. We may not control the data collected by Plugins. If you are logged into a social network, the social network may be able to link your use of our offerings to their services and/or platform.
For example, if you interact with a Plugin by clicking on "Like," "Follow," or "Share," or by writing a comment, this information may automatically appear in your profile on the relevant social network service or platform. Even if you are not logged in, the Plugins may send your IP address to social network services and/or platforms. Please note this when using our offerings.
When you connect to a social networking service or platform on a device that is also used by others, these other users may be able to see information that is stored or displayed in connection with your profile on the social networking service page.
Information we collect from other parties:
We receive and process information from our affiliates and from third-party sources, including employers, business partners, business contact databases, enrichment services, channel partners (e.g., resellers), marketing service providers, third-party data aggregators, and social networking services and platforms (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook). We also receive information from publicly available sources and licensors. The categories of personal information we collect from these sources include:

Professional information

What are Autodesk’s storage and data retention practices?
We store your personal data and content on our servers and the servers of our service providers. Because we and our service providers maintain servers in global locations, your personal data may be transferred across national borders and stored on the servers outside of your country or region. We will retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary or permitted and proportionate to the purpose for which it was collected. For example, to provide you with the offerings that you are using or have requested, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and as needed to comply with our legal obligations. The criteria that we use to determine our retention period include the duration of our relationship with you, nature and sensitivity of the processed data, whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data, the risk of harm from unauthorized disclosure of data and whether the purpose of processing can be achieved by other means. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time. As described further below, you have the ability to delete information from your account at any time. There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize or de-identify your personal data due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance or other operational reasons.
Does Autodesk transfer your personal data across national borders?
Because Autodesk is a global company, we transfer personal data across national borders to other countries, in compliance with the laws that apply to that data.  For example, if your data is transferred from one of our entities in the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States, or to another country outside of the EEA that does not provide adequate protection for personal data, as determined by the European Commission, we rely on our EU Binding Corporate Rules  approved by the Irish Data Protection Commission in May 2023, which you can find on our website
here.
If your data is transferred from one of our entities in the United Kingdom or in Switzerland to a country that does not provide adequate protection for personal data (as determined by UK and Swiss Data Protection Laws) we rely on the legal mechanism of Standard Contractual Clauses for such transfers.
Autodesk complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (‘EU-U.S. DPF’), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, European Commission, UK Government, and Swiss Federal Administration regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, and their related principles (the "Data Privacy Framework Principles"). Autodesk has certified to the U.S. International Trade Administration, within the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern.
In compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, Autodesk commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this policy should first contact at:
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
.
Autodesk has further committed to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution-American Arbitration Association
(“ICDR-AAA”), an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the ICDR-AAA DPF independent recourse mechanism. The services of ICDR-AAA are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may have the possibility to engage in binding arbitration to resolve residual disputes. For more information on this option, please see Annex I of the Data Privacy Framework Principles.
Autodesk’s commitment to subject the personal information described in this Policy to the Data Privacy Framework is subject to the enforcement and investigative powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view our certification, please visit

Autodesk may share personal information with third parties under certain circumstances described above. Autodesk’s obligations under the Data Privacy Framework Principles extend to third parties acting as agents who help us run our business and provide services, and Autodesk remains liable should a third party acting as our agent process personal information subject to this Policy in a manner inconsistent with this Policy, except where Autodesk is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
What are Autodesk’s marketing and advertising practices?
We use analytics tools and also work with one or more advertising networks and digital advertising partners (our “Ad Partners”) that use Cookies to collect information about application visitors, to serve ads, and to help us track results of advertising and marketing campaigns. Partners of our Ad Partners may also use Cookies to collect information from you for these purposes. Through these means, we and/or our Ad Partners and their partners may be able to collect information from application visitors, including websites visited, how and when applications are used, marketing preferences, IP addresses, device IDs, and browser information. This information is used to display personalized advertising in websites and other applications, to calculate and control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, to deliver ads that relate to a visitor’s interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. We process your personal data for the above activities in furtherance of our legitimate interests or, where required, with your consent.
You can opt out of the use of your information by certain Ad Partners for online behavioral advertising by using the Digital Advertising Alliance’s
Your AdChoices
tool. The Your AdChoices tool may not work if your browser does not accept third-party Cookies, and if you delete Cookies, use a different browser, or use a different computer, you will need to use the tool again to renew your opt-out.
If you reside in the U.S., please see what additional rights you might have in the "Privacy Rights under U.S. Privacy Laws" section below.
As described above, you can change your Cookie preferences. Cookie choices are generally application-, browser-, and device-specific, so you may need to refresh your choices if you visit a different application, use a new browser or device, or clear your browser’s cookies.
How does Autodesk protect children and student data?
At Autodesk, we care deeply about children’s privacy and protecting their data.
Most of our applications are made for the general public and are designed for adult users. We refer to these applications as “general interest applications.” We do not knowingly collect personal data from children in connection with general interest applications. If you become aware of any unauthorized submission of children's personal information to Autodesk, please inform us by contacting us using the contact information listed below so that we may conduct the necessary investigation which may result in deletion of the data.  Certain applications are appropriate for and are intended for use by children. We refer to these applications as “Children’s applications.”
Our
Children’s Privacy Statement
applies to personal data collected from certain child and student users of Autodesk offerings, including Children's applications. If there is a conflict between our Children’s Privacy Statement and our Privacy Statement, the Children’s Privacy Statement sets the standard for how we process children’s personal data. For more information, please refer to our
Children’s Privacy Statement
.
Is the personal data you give us ever displayed publicly?
As always, we urge you to be mindful when deciding to disclose personal data, including on our offerings. Our offerings may allow you to post content, including comments and “likes,” that can be visible to the public.
In some cases, you can limit who can view or access the information and content you post. In other cases, the information and content might be available to registered members of the offering, or even to the general public. Your name, username, profile image, or email address (particularly if this is your username) may be posted along with any message or other content you post through some of our offerings.
If you are posting information you do not want to be disclosed publicly, make sure you are using an offering that allows you to control who sees information you have posted.
Will this Privacy Statement change?
We may change this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in the law, our data handling practices, or the features of our business. The updated Privacy Statement will be available at our Trust Center
here
. We will show the date the Privacy Statement was last updated to help you know when we change it. If we make material changes to our Privacy Statement, we will endeavor to provide you with notice before such changes take effect, such as through prominent notice on our website or services or by email.

Privacy Rights under U.S. Privacy Laws
We described several types of rights in
“What Rights and Choices Do You Have?”
above.
If you reside in California, you may have the following rights:
right to access
the specific pieces of your information that we have collected about you in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format;
right to know
details about our processing of your information;
right to request deletion
of your personal information;
right to correct
inaccurate data in certain circumstances;
right to opt-out of sales of personal information and the sharing of your personal information for cross context behavioral and targeted advertising;
and
the right to non-discrimination
(e.g., to not be denied goods or services for exercising your rights).
To the extent applicable, you also have the right to limit the use and disclosure of any "sensitive personal information, according to the legal definition of what constitutes sensitive personal information."
California law treats certain disclosures of personal information with third parties in exchange for something of value as “sales,” even when no money changes hands. Autodesk does not exchange your personal information for money. However, some of the technologies we use to provide our offerings involve transfers of personal information that may be considered a “sale” under California law. In addition, California consumers have the right to opt out of the “sharing” of their information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
You may exercise these rights by going to
www.Autodesk.com
and clicking on Do Not Sell or Share link provided at the bottom of the page. You may also opt out of these transfers by submitting
this form
or by emailing us at
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
.
You can exercise the rights above by emailing us at
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
. To request a copy of the personal information in your account, you can also
submit this form
. To request deletion of your personal information, you can also
submit this form
. If you have an Autodesk account, you can edit and correct your personal information at any time by changing it in your account.
Except as described in this notice or provided under applicable privacy laws, there is no charge to exercise your legal rights. However, if your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may:
Charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or taking the action requested; or
Refuse to act on the request and notify you of the reason for refusing the request.
Please note that the above rights are not absolute, and we may be entitled to refuse requests in whole or in part, where exceptions under applicable law apply. For example, we may decline certain requests where the time and resources expended by us to honor the request significantly outweigh the benefit provided to the consumer.
We may need to verify your identity before completing your rights request. How we verify your identity depends on whether you hold an account with Autodesk:
Individuals with Autodesk accounts can verify their identity by logging into their account.
Individuals without Autodesk accounts (non-accountholders) need to provide information establishing their identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We may ask non-accountholders to provide information such as name, e-mail addresses, and information relating to their use of the Autodesk websites or other offerings.
Authorized Agents: Persons authorized to submit requests on behalf of a consumer (“agents”) can submit a request by email to
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
. We may notify the consumer and require the consumer to independently verify their identity with us and confirm that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the rights request before fulfilling the authorized agent’s request. This verification process is not necessary if your authorized agent provides documentation reflecting that the authorized agent has power of attorney to act on your behalf under Cal. Probate Code §§ 4121 to 4130. For additional information, please see our
U.S. Privacy Law FAQs for California
.
We will not respond to your data rights request until we are able to verify your identity or confirm the validity of an Authorized Agent request. For more information about authorized agent requests, please see
U.S. Privacy Law FAQs for California
.
We retain certain information relating to your CPRA request to demonstrate compliance with CPRA and to improve our consumer request process. We retain personal information that is reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purpose for which it was collected or for other disclosed and compatible purposes.
The following table provides a description of the personal information that we have disclosed for our business purposes, the personal information that we have sold or shared, and the categories of third parties that received the personal information.

Children's Privacy Statement
Effective: January 1, 2025
This Children’s Privacy Statement supplements the
Autodesk Privacy Statement
. It provides specific information about how we process children’s and students’ personal data, and it applies to:
(1)  users of Tinkercad regardless of age; and
(2)  individuals enrolled at a primary, secondary, or other educational institution (the “Education Provider”) who use our products or cloud-based services offered in a K-12 educational setting pursuant to a signed data privacy agreement with Education Providers (“Student Applications”), as described in the “
Education and FERPA
” section below.
We consider an individual to be a
child
for the purposes of this Children’s Privacy Statement if applicable law limits the processing of the individual’s personal data because the individual is under a certain age (for example, under age 13 pursuant to the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)).
For purposes of this Children’s Privacy Statement, a
student
refers to any individual who uses a Student Application.
U.S. visitors: For more information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and general tips about protecting children’s online privacy, please visit
OnGuard Online
.
Most Autodesk websites, products and services (“applications”) are primarily designed for adults. We refer to applications designed for adults as “general interest applications.” We do not knowingly collect personal data from children in connection with general interest applications. Certain Autodesk applications are appropriate for and are intended for use by children. We refer to these applications as “Children’s applications.” At this time, Tinkercad is Autodesk’s only Children’s application. Note that a Children’s application may also be a Student Application, if it meets the criteria described above.
This Children’s Privacy Statement contains the following information:
What information do we collect from children and students
How we use the information we collect
How we share information with third parties
Tinkercad’s privacy information for Child users
How Autodesk acts as a “School Official” with respect to its Education offerings under FERPA (Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act)
Conflicts between this Children’s Privacy Statement and other documents
Will this Privacy Statement change?
How to contact us
1.	What information do we collect from children and students?
We collect the following information via the methods listed below:
Information provided by a child, their parent or legal guardian:
We collect a child’s username, password, birthdate, and parent or guardian’s email address when a child registers to use a Tinkercad.
Information provided by or about a student:
When a student creates a student account to use Student Applications, we collect a student’s first and last name, email address, birthdate, school address and educational verification information.
When an Education Provider creates an account for their student, by adding the student through Single Sign On for example, we may collect less personal information about a student (e.g., we may not require a birthdate or password).
Information we collect automatically:
We collect information automatically when children and students use our products and services. Examples include type of computer operating system, IP address or mobile device identifier, web browser used, frequency with which the child/student visits various parts of our applications, data regarding the online or mobile service provider.
This data is collected using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and similar technologies (“Cookies”). This data may be collected by Autodesk or by a third party. For a list of third parties that use Cookies on our Children’s applications and links to their privacy policies, please visit the
Children’s Privacy Statement - Third Party List
. Please visit our
Cookie Statement
for more information about our Cookie practices and a list of third parties that use Cookies on our general interest applications.
Registration
Children can register on Tinkercad to (among other things):
view and download content
take tutorials, create, edit, and import content
like others’ content
upload a photo
participate in contests
view in-application notifications
During the registration process, we will ask the child to provide certain personal data, including:
parent or guardian’s email address
child’s member or account username, and password
child’s birthdate to validate age.
Persistent identifiers
When children interact with us, certain personal data and non-personally identifiable data may be collected automatically, both to make our applications more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business.
Examples include:
type of computer operating system
child’s IP address or mobile device identifier
web browser used
frequency with which the child visits various parts of our applications
data regarding the online or mobile service provider
This data is collected using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and similar technologies (“Cookies”). This data may be collected by Autodesk or by a third party. For a list of third parties that use Cookies on our Children’s applications and links to their privacy policies, please visit the
Children’s Privacy Statement - Analytics List
. Please visit our
Cookie Statement
for more information about our Cookie practices and a list of third parties that use Cookies on our general interest applications.
Data minimization
We will not require a child to provide more data than is reasonably necessary to use Children’s applications. If a child chooses not to share certain personal data (such as a parent or guardian’s email for purposes of gathering consent if needed) with us, we may limit their access to the Children’s application or disable certain features, such as the ability to publish content publicly.
Purpose of collection
We only collect and use children’s data to fulfill our duties and provide the Children’s applications. Children’s data will be used:
for security purposes,
to send notices and gather parental or legal guardian consent,
to provide the services,
to allow parents to have access to their child's account.
Data retention
We store your personal data and content on our servers and the servers of our service providers. Because we and our service providers maintain servers in global locations, your personal data may be transferred across national borders and stored on the servers outside of your country or region. We will retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary or permitted and proportionate to the purpose for which it was collected, for example, to provide you with the offerings that you are using or have requested, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and as needed to comply with our legal obligations. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time. There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize or de-identify your information due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance or other operational reasons.
Consent Processes
Our Children’s applications sometimes collect personal data from children or allow children to create, share and publicly post content. Before allowing children to use certain features and functionality that collect personal data from them, we seek parental or guardian consent, if required by applicable law:by requiring a signed consent form to be submitted by mail or email attachment.
We may also require parents or guardians to open their own accounts so that they can view and moderate their child’s account. For further details, please see “
Moderator choices and controls
” below.
If we do not receive parental consent within reasonable time, we will delete the parental contact information provided by the child, along with any other data associated with the child.
For more information on parental rights in the United States with respect to a child’s educational record under the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please see “
Education and FERPA
” below.
2.	How we use the information we collect
Purpose of collection
We use collected information about children and students:
to provide access to Tinkercad and Student Applications,
for security purposes,
to send notices and gather parental or legal guardian consent (when parental consent is required),
to allow parents or Education Providers to have access to their child’s or student’s account.
Data minimization
We will not require a child or student to provide more data than is reasonably necessary to use Children’s applications or Student Applications. If a child chooses not to share certain personal data (such as a parent or guardian’s email for purposes of gathering consent if needed) with us, we may limit their access to the Children’s application or disable certain features.
Data retention
We store your personal data and content on our servers and the servers of our service providers. Because we and our service providers maintain servers in global locations, your personal data may be transferred across national borders and stored on the servers outside of your country or region. We will retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary or permitted and proportionate to the purpose for which it was collected. For example, we may retain your data  to provide you with the Children’s applications or Student Applications that you are using or have requested, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and as needed to comply with our legal obligations. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time. There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize or de-identify your information due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance or other operational reasons.
Augmented Reality
Our Children’s applications may access device cameras to offer augmented reality functions, such as overlaying 3D models developed in the Children’s application over the image available through the camera. Autodesk does not collect or receive any information captured from the device’s camera. Users can remove an application’s access to a device’s camera by changing the device’s settings.
Email contact with a Child
Some of our applications may collect online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with a user who makes a specific request through customer service. For example, a user may email us to ask for help in understanding how to use a design tool that the child is having trouble with, or the user may want to sign up for a monthly newsletter.
If we know that we are communicating with a child using Autodesk Children’s Applications without parent or guardian consent and such consent is required by applicable law, we will respond once to the communication, delete their personal data, and will not participate in any ongoing communication.
Here is how we would handle communication requests:
One-time communication
After we respond to the child’s question or request, we or our service provider will delete this data immediately after responding to the question or request.
If a child initiates additional communication, submits additional tickets, or signs up for newsletters, we will delete the child’s personal data in each instance, and will not retain a record. The parent may need to opt-out of each communication separately.
Communicating more than once
Where there is an activity or service where we need to communicate with a child more than once and we have not already obtained parent or guardian consent where such consent is required by applicable law:
If we collect the child’s contact data for ongoing communications, we will also require a parent or guardian email address (if we have not already obtained verifiable parent or guardian consent) so we can notify the parent about the collection and use, and to provide the parent or guardian with an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.
Persistent identifiers
When children interact with us, certain personal data and non-personally identifiable data may be collected automatically, both to make our applications more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business.
Examples include:
the type of computer operating system
the child’s IP address or mobile device identifier
the web browser used
the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our applications
data regarding the online or mobile service provider
This data is collected using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and similar technologies (“Cookies”). This data may be collected by Autodesk or by a third party.

3.	How we share information with third parties
We do not sell children’s and students’ personal information to third parties. Autodesk and its third-party providers will not use children’s or students’ personal data for advertising purposes, to create a profile about a child and tie it to an application or for any other purpose prohibited by law or outside the authorization provided by parental, guardian, or school, as may be applicable.
We may disclose personal information:
With our trusted vendors and service providers working on our behalf. Please see the “
How does Autodesk disclose your personal data?

4.	Tinkercad’s privacy information for Child users
kidSAFE Seal COPPA certification
Tinkercad is certified as COPPA compliant by the kidSAFE Seal Program. kidSAFE is also a Federal Trade Commission-approved COPPA Safe Harbor provider.
To learn more or verify Tinkercad’s certification by KidSAFE, click on the KidSAFE seal on Tinkercad webpages or visit
https://www.kidsafeseal.com/certifiedproducts/tinkercad.html
.
Tinkercad Account creation
We do not knowingly allow a child to create an account without the consent of a parent/legal guardian.
If we discover that we have processed a child’s personal data in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, we will promptly delete the data or bring that processing into compliance with applicable law, such as by obtaining appropriate permission for that processing.
o
Child account created with parental consent
Where we know that parent or guardian consent is required by applicable law for a child user of an application, we will ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect personal data from the child. If we do not receive parental consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the parental contact information provided by the child, along with any other data associated with the child.
Tinkercad sometimes collects personal data from children or allows children to create, share and publicly post content. Before allowing children to use certain features and functionality that collect personal data from them, we seek parental or guardian consent, if required by applicable law: by requiring a signed consent form to be submitted by mail or email attachment.
We may also require parents or guardians to open their own accounts so that they can view and moderate their child’s account. For further details, please see “
Moderator choices and controls
” below.
o
Child access authorized by a school
We may rely on an Education Provider to provide consent on behalf of a parent, as described in the “Education and Ferpa” section below.
For more information on parental rights in the United States with respect to a child’s educational record under the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please see “
Education and FERPA
” below.
Children’s Use of Tinkercad
Children can register on Tinkercad to (among other things):
view and download content
take tutorials, create, edit, and import content
like others’ content
upload a photo
view in-application notifications
Data Collected via Specific User activities in Tinkercad
o
Content generated by a Child and ability to delete Child-generated content
Tinkercad might include activities that allow users to create or manipulate content and save it. Such content may be accessible by the public depending on the child’s settings when they posted the content.
We honor requests to delete any content that they post on Tinkercad unless we are required by law to retain it.
o
Augmented Reality
Tinkercad may access device cameras to offer augmented reality functions, such as overlaying 3D models developed in Tinkercad over the image available through the camera. Autodesk does not collect or receive any information captured from the device’s camera. Users can remove an application’s access to a device’s camera by changing the device’s settings.
o
Email contact with a Child
Some of our applications may collect online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with a user who makes a specific request through Customer Service. For example, a child user may email us to ask for help in understanding how to use a design tool that the child is having trouble with..
If we know that we are communicating with a child using Tinkercad without parent or guardian consent and such consent is required by applicable law, we will respond once to the communication, delete their personal data, and will not participate in any ongoing communication.
Here is how we would handle communication requests:
One-time communication
After we respond to the child’s question or request, we or our service provider will delete this data immediately after responding to the question or request.
If a child initiates additional communication, submits additional tickets, or signs up for newsletters, we will delete the child’s personal data in each instance, and will not retain a record. The parent may need to opt-out of each communication separately.
Communicating more than once
Where there is an activity or service where we need to communicate with a child more than once, we will also require a parent or guardian email address so we can notify the parent about the collection and use, and to provide the parent or guardian with an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.
Moderator choices and controls in Tinkercad
Account moderated by a parent or legal guardian
Tinkercad may enable parents and guardians to “moderate” a child’s account, giving the moderator the ability to review how the child is using Tinkercad and allowing them to make certain choices about how the child’s personal data is processed. Moderators can, at any time:
o    refuse to permit us to collect further personal data from the child in association with a particular account
o    request that we delete from our records the personal data we have collected in connection with that account
Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service and that any content saved in that account may no longer be accessible. Please note that Autodesk does not have control over third parties (e.g., other users) who may have copied or reposted publicly posted information.
Moderators can access, change, or delete the personal data that we have collected from a child in one of the following ways:
o    request access to or delete personal data by logging into their account (where available)
o    contact us to request access, a change, or delete personal data by sending an email
to
.
In any correspondence such as email or mail, please include:
o    the name of the application
o    the child’s username
o    the moderator’s email address and telephone number
To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify a moderator’s identity before granting access to a child’s personal data. Please visit the “
How does Autodesk protect your data
” section in the
Autodesk Privacy Statement
for additional information.
Account moderated by an Education Provider
Applications that we provide directly to Education Providers for use in educational settings may allow Education Providers to act as “moderators” with respect to student accounts. See the “Education and FERPA, Tinkercad Classrooms” section for more information.
Access, correction, deletion, objection, restriction rights, or rights to obtain a copy of your personal data are described in the
Autodesk Privacy Statement
.
5.	How Autodesk Acts as a “School Official” with respect to its Education offerings under FERPA (Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
This section describes Autodesk’s practices when Tinkercad and our Student Applications are used.
This section does not apply when users access Autodesk applications that are not Student Applications Schools or school districts that would like to inquire about Autodesk’s student data privacy agreement may contact Autodesk at
privacy.questions@autodesk.com
.
Educational institution consent in lieu of a parent
Autodesk may provide
Tinkercad
directly to Education Providers for use in educational settings, in which case Education Providers may provide consent for the collection of personal data from students, where allowed by applicable law. Autodesk expects Education Providers to notify parents or guardians before providing consent to such collection.
Autodesk provides information for teachers in the
COPPA
Direct Notice.
We may also ask Education Providers to obtain consent directly from a parent or guardian instead of, or in addition to, the school providing consent. In these cases, Tinkercad may allow for the parent or guardian to be added as a moderator of the student’s account. Parental or guardian consent would also allow a child to continue using Tinkercad outside of school.
Tinkercad Classrooms
A teacher may become a moderator for students using Tinkercad by creating a Classroom under their teacher account and having students join the Classroom using a Class code provided by the teacher. A student may join the Classroom using their preexisting account or without registering for a Tinkercad account and instead using a nickname provided by the teacher. Autodesk will not collect personal data from the student as a result of joining a Classroom, and the student will not be able to communicate or share personal data with Tinkercad members other than the teacher of the Classroom. All other data collection practices are consistent with those described in the Children’s Privacy Statement.
Prior to allowing a student with a pre-existing account to join a Classroom, a teacher is responsible for ensuring that the student’s parent or guardian has given any consent required by applicable law, either as described in this Children’s Privacy Statement or directly to the teacher or the teacher’s school or school district. A teacher will remain moderator of the student’s account as long as the student is participating in the Tinkercad Classroom.
