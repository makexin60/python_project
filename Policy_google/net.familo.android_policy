We process your personal data primarily based on the
contract
(General Terms and Conditions) between us and you (Art. 6(1)(b) of GDPR).
We ask for your explicit consent to collect and process your location data. This consent is voluntary, and you can withdraw it at any time by adjusting your location settings in your phone. However, please note that if you withdraw consent for location data processing, certain core functionalities of the app, such as real-time location sharing, may be limited.
We do not use profiling or automated decision-making that would significantly affect users' rights. The app allows users to create profiles, add family members, and track their locations, but it does not involve automatic analysis or decision-making based on this data.
We also want to share a few important details about how we use your data:
Before registration, you can review our General Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy. You can access and read them directly from the registration screen. After registration, you can return to the General Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy anytime within the app, on our website or our app store page.
The manually entered data (mobile number, username) are required to enable the use of the app and its features. The optional input of additional data (e-mail address, gender and birthdate) improves the user experience of the app for you.
You can use FamiloApp by entering a pseudonym. There is no need to enter your real name in the app.
For the app and all of its features to work properly, automatic collection and use of Device and Network Information is required during sessions (see section
"What kind of data do we collect?"
).
Your user account is created using a randomized user ID (technically as 12-byte ObjectId value). We use this account to authenticate users and ensure system security for example.
After you granted us access to your address book, we will propose contacts to connect with, which are also registered on FamiloApp. You can connect with others and share content with them within FamiloApp. The contacts in your address book will be processed but not stored. Through so-called hashing, we can not see any specific contacts on the server side, unless they are also registered on FamiloApp.
All data is collected and processed by us in the minimum necessity to guarantee the functionality of the app.
Our users expect high accuracy for location-based features, and we provide this to deliver the best possible experience. However, if you choose a less accurate location mode, such as "Places only" or "Invisible," we do not continuously track your location. Instead, your location is only detected when necessary for these specific features and is not stored permanently.
By offering personalized and prominent adjustable location modes for users we follow the "privacy by design" principle.
User-generated content (such as text, images, audio, or video) within FamiloApp is never shared outside your group.
Your data is not processed for third-party advertising purposes.
The collection and processing of your payment data for billing purposes will not be handled by us directly. It will be processed by third-party payment providers who manage payment transactions securely on our behalf.
To continually improve FamiloApp's features and user experience, we rely on a variety of third-party services, analytics, location, mapping, cloud storage, and more. These services help enhance app performance and user engagement. We ensure all third-party providers adhere to strict data protection agreements regarding the access, storage, and processing of your data. Additionally, we implement technical safeguards, including TLS/SSL encryption, to protect your data during transfers and ensure its confidentiality and integrity.

According to Art. 6(1)(f) of GDPR, we have a legitimate interest in collecting such statistical data, as it helps us improve the app and user experience, without overriding your rights and freedoms.

Who is responsible and how do I contact FamiloApp?
).
You can access and export all personal data that we store about you to you or a third party by contacting us (see section

You may submit a request to exercise any of these rights by contacting us (see section

). We will respond to your request within 30 days, as required under the GDPR, unless an extension is necessary due to the complexity of the request or a high volume of requests.
If you are not satisfied with how we have addressed your issue, you have the right to file a complaint about how your personal data is being handled with the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI).
We take all reasonable technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the app and data transmission. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, and to ensure data accuracy and legitimate use, we have implemented appropriate procedures to safeguard the data handled within the FamiloApp.
Your registration and authentication in the app are done through a unique code sent via SMS, which you must enter into the app. This provides a level of security comparable to mobile TAN processing in online banking.
Data transfer to our server backend is secured via TLS/SSL encryption using the HTTPS protocol, with additional transport encryption.
Local storage on your device is limited to what's necessary for the functionality of FamiloApp. When you uninstall the app, all data is erased from the device. However, on Android devices, data stored on external memory may remain even after uninstallation.
App usage is logged within FamiloApp, but by default, we do not access this data. You can choose to send this data to us via email for troubleshooting and improving your app experience.
Certain screens within FamiloApp load as web pages, but these are exclusively owned by FamiloApp and not third-party websites.
Our server backend is protected by various safety and security mechanisms. You authenticate and gain access using a unique token based on your personal data, ensuring secure authentication. We also implement firewalls and conduct regular security updates to safeguard your information.
In the event of a data breach or security incident, we will take immediate steps to mitigate the impact and notify affected users. This includes informing you without undue delay if your personal data is compromised. We will also report the incident to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of it.
