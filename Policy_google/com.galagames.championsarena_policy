Marketing
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain Personal Data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following Personal Data control mechanisms:
We may use your Personal Data to form a view on what Services we think may be of interest to you. You will receive marketing communications from us if (i) you have requested information from us; or (ii) use our Services, in each case, you have chosen to opt-in and not opted out of receiving marketing communications. We may transfer or otherwise make available your Personal Data to authorized third parties, including affiliates, and associate partners/business partners. We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your Personal Data with any company outside of GALA for marketing purposes.
You acknowledge by providing your personal information in connection with receiving services from GALA, that you have an established business relationship with GALA. As such, you provide GALA with express consent to contact you using your personal information for all matters relative to your services with GALA. This may include the use of autodialed or pre-recorded telephonic communications for operational communication, which may include the verification of your personal information, the collection of a debt, or any other necessary communication or confirmation in connection with any element of your ongoing service with GALA. You further acknowledge that this established business relationship may extend beyond the standard eighteen months from the last transaction standard. You understand that services with GALA may not have such a transaction within eighteen months, but that the relationship will still be considered as ongoing due to the specific nature of GALA services. The established business relationship which is created upon the initiation of services, and the providing of personal information to GALA shall continue for five years following the providing or updating of any personal information in connection with your services with GALA. With respect to sales and marketing from GALA specifically, you understand that the same existing business relationship standard applies.
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us. However, where you opt out of receiving marketing messages, this will not apply to Personal Data provided to us as a result of your use of our Service, a product/service experience or other transactions. Further, Gala Games is not responsible for the collection and use of your Personal Data by any Company outside of Gala Games. Gala Games assumes no liability whatsoever for any disclosure of Personal Data due to unauthorized third-party access or other acts of third parties, or any other acts or omissions beyond the reasonable control of Gala Games.
How we Share your Information – Personal Data shared with third parties.
We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
It may be necessary to disclose your Personal Data to comply with any legal obligation, to defend or investigate any illegal or suspected violations of GALA’s Terms and Conditions, to enforce our Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy, or to protect the rights, safety, and security of GALA, our users, or the public.
We may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to provide you with the Services; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and to verify your identity. These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by you.
We may share some or all of your Personal Data with third parties (e.g. the purchaser or new owner) in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires GALA assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by GALA and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
Our Services may contain links to other third party or external affiliates’ websites, extensions, and resources which are regulated by their own privacy policies. GALA is not responsible for the privacy policies of these third party websites even if they were accessed using the links from our Services. We do not have any control or authority over the contents of those sites, extensions or resources provided by third parties or external affiliates, and accept no liability for any losses caused by them, if you access or use any of the third-party links, extensions or resources. It is solely at your own risk and you will be subject to third parties’ separate terms and conditions of use.

Transfers outside of the EEA
We may share your Personal Data within GALA and other companies that assist in providing GALA Services which are based in various locations globally. If you are based in Europe, this will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). In addition, many of our external third parties are also based outside of the EEA so their processing of your Personal Data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. We may transfer personal data from EEA to third countries outside of EEA, under the following conditions:
Contractual Obligation: Where transfers are necessary to satisfy our obligation to you under our EULA, including to provide you with our services and customer support services, and to optimize Gala Games; and
Consent: where you have consented to the transfer of your Personal Data to a third country.
Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see
European Commission: Adequacy Decisions
We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see
European Commission: EU Standard Contractual Clauses
In respect of transfers to entities in the US, we may transfer Personal Data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see
European Commission: EU-US Data Transfers

Where we are unable to comply with your request of deletion, we will notify you at the time of your request.
Object to processing
You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing

(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to delete it;
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at privacy@gala.games.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your rights to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
