Further information about retention time
Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.

Further information about retention time
Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.
Therefore:
Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of  this document or by contacting the Owner.
The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.

We may transfer and process your personal data outside of the United Kingdom/European Union to countries where data protection laws are less stringent than those in the UK. When we transfer your personal data outside of the UK, we only do so to entities that offer our users the same level of data protection as that afforded by the UK Data Protection Act 2018, UK GDPR and the EU GDPR.
We will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information; or
We will use specific contracts approved for use in the UK or EU which give personal information the same protection it has in the UK/EU. For example, the use of Article 46 UK and EU GDPR safeguard mechanisms to transfer personal data endorsed by the UK Government or European Commission.
To find out more about the transfer mechanism used please contact us at
privacy@monedata.io
Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take reasonable measures to protect your personal data, Monedata cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted and any transmission is at your own risk.
Data retention
Monedata will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
Monedata may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Children data
This website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children. Pursuant to Data Protection Laws this means to individuals under the age of 13 (UK) or 16 (EU).
Data Subject Rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under Data Protection Laws. You can:
Request access to your personal data:
This is known as a "data subject access request" and enables you to receive a copy of the personal data Monedata hold about you.
Request correction of your personal data:
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request erasure of your personal data:
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note: We may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data:
This is where we are processing your personal data based on a legitimate interest or those of a third party and you may challenge this. However, we may be entitled to continue processing your information based on our legitimate interests or where this is relevant to any legal claims. See also
Marketing communications.
Request restriction of processing your personal information:
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the information's accuracy (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request transfer of your personal information (“data portability”):
This is where in some circumstances we will provide to you or a third party you have chosen your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Right to withdraw consent:
This is where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. Depending on the processing activity, if you withdraw your consent we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Automated decision making:
This is where decisions are made about you by automated means. We do not carry out automated decision making that results in legal or similarly significant effect.
Keeping personal information accurate and current
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us. If you wish to update your personal data please contact us.
Carrying out your data subject rights
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of the other rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at
privacy@monedata.io
Concerns and complaints
We would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns in the first instance. Please see
Contact us
section. If you have unresolved concerns and you live or work in the UK or believe that a personal data breach happened in the UK you have the right to complain at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (
www.ico.org.uk
).
If you live or work outside the UK or you have a complaint concerning our personal data processing activities you may lodge a complaint with another supervisory authority.
Changes to our privacy notice
This privacy notice may be changed from time to time in response to legal, technical or business developments. We will take appropriate measures to inform you when we update our privacy notice. We will obtain your consent to any material privacy notice changes if and where this is required by applicable Data Protection Laws.

How Google retains data we collect
Advertising
Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses cookies in advertising
Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).
We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These
server logs
typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
Our advertising cookies
To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.
See more detail about the
types of cookies used by Google
and our partners and
how we use them
.
How you can control advertising cookies
You can use
ad settings
to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.
You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based
aboutads.info choices
page or the EU-based
Your Online Choices
.
Finally, you can
manage cookies in your web browser
.
Other technologies used in advertising
Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the
IP address
, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
Location
Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us.  Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:
Reset your device’s advertising ID
, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
Delete your device’s advertising ID
, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.
To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

iOS
Devices with iOS use Apple’s Advertising Identifier. To learn more about your choices for use of this identifier, visit the
Settings
app on your device.
Connected TV/Over-the-Top
Advertising identifiers for connected TV
Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.
The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:
Reset advertising ID
Delete advertising ID
Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
Your advertising ID (long string)
These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

What determines the ads by Google that I see?
Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.
Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.
Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.
The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.
You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.
Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.
We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.

We describe the information received through the Smaato Websites in Section 5 below, titled “Privacy Practices for the Smaato Websites.”
We encourage consumers to learn about how information (including information we collect) can be used to market to them, and how to exercise their choices to permit or limit such marketing. We describe ways consumers can exercise that choice or opt-out of marketing in Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
1. Introduction and Background
Smaato provides mobile advertising technology services that facilitate transactions among demand-side platforms, advertisers, app developers, publishers of mobile websites and/or apps, and ad exchanges (collectively, “Clients”), and service providers (collectively “Partners”). We do this by making available the Smaato Ad Services and other tools to Clients. Clients use the Smaato Ad Services and other tools to deliver advertising to End Users, and we in turn provide our services to help Clients (and their own customers) to deliver ads that are of interest to End Users. We explain what SDKs and APIs are in Section 3 below, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs,” which also explains how cookies and similar technologies (which we also use to provide the Smaato Ad Services) work.
2. Privacy Practices for the Smaato Ad Services
a. Information Collected Through the Smaato Ad Services
Through the Smaato Ad Services, we may collect information about End Users (to the extent that Clients pass such information to Smaato), which includes:
IP addresses, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information such as information about End Users’ operating system;
Rough geolocation information;
Cookie IDs, Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Google Advertising IDs (collectively, “Mobile IDs”);
Age;
Gender;
Device type and other device information (e.g., whether an End User is using a smartphone or tablet, and related information);
Network provider;
Mobile browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, and Chrome); and
Other unique identifiers that may be associated with an End Users’ device, including identifiers provided by Clients or their service providers.
We refer to all of the above information as the “Service Information.”
b. How We Use the Information Collected Through the Smaato Ad Services
We use the Service Information to provide a variety of services to our Clients related to advertising and marketing, including services we may describe elsewhere on Smaato Websites. This includes use of the Service Information for purposes such as to:
Provide customer, technical, and operational support for the Smaato Ad Services, detect and protect against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity, and resolve disputes and enforce our terms and conditions and other rights we may have. This may also include analyzing, customizing, and improving the features of the Smaato Ad Services;
Provide information and analytics to Clients about the advertising inventory provided through the Smaato Ad Services;
We, or our Clients, may deploy online cookies to track End Users across mobile websites and/or apps, or to associate End Users and these cookies with Mobile IDs. You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in Section 3 below, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs.”
c. How We Share Information We Collect Through the Smaato Ad Services
We share the Service Information with Clients and Partners in order to provide the Smaato Ad Services. For example, we share the Service Information with:
Clients and their marketing and service providers, so they may provide targeted advertising to End Users on mobile websites and/or apps;
Partners that facilitate the functioning of the Smaato Ad Services (e.g., traffic and ad quality verification vendors and data centers).
Even when a Client no longer accesses our SDK, we may continue to use and share Service Information as described in this Policy. The processes we described above often involve cookies or similar technologies, which may be associated with other information about End Users, such as End Users’ interests, demographics, or transactions. This is generally known as “interest-based advertising.” We encourage individuals who are interested in controlling or learning about this type of advertising to go to Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options,” or go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA’s) website at www.aboutads.info. We may also share Service Information with third parties:
Pursuant to a request or authorization by an End User or Client;
If the disclosure is provided to: (a) comply in good faith with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement; (b) enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements; or (c) protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity;
Where the information is aggregated or de-identified; and
As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence).
3. Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs
a. Cookies and Pixel Tags
Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as unique browser identifiers. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your browser. Our servers may deploy a cookie on your browser when you visit the Smaato Websites. Our Clients and Partners may do likewise on the Smaato Websites, our Clients’ and Partners’ websites, and elsewhere. Smaato may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Persistent cookies, unlike session cookies, remain after you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to any given website. Using persistent cookies, a site operator (or a third party they work with) can “remember” what you have previously done on a website and personalize the site, or ads you see, for you. This technology may also provide a site operator or third party (or us, when you visit the Smaato Websites) with information regarding your IP address, browser type, the web pages that you visit just before or after visiting a website, the web pages viewed, and the dates and times of your visits. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access a web page with a pixel tag, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit, and permit us, or our Clients or Partners, to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. We, alone or with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, for example, “remember” you, track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or interact with advertising. We, and our Clients and Partners, use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests. If you wish to opt-out of interest-based mobile advertising, please see Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.” Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the Smaato Websites’ functionalities and offerings, and those of other websites you visit.
b. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs
We, or our Clients or Partners, may use or work with mobile SDKs (including our own SDK(s), which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as Mobile IDs, and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Smaato Ad Services and those using our Smaato Ad Services. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. Sometimes, we obtain data through other (generally, simpler) interfaces that deliver similar data to us, which are commonly referred to (and which we refer to) as APIs. We may use these technologies, for example, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you would like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
4. Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options
In most cases, consumers have control over whether or not they would like to receive relevant ads and marketing emails from our Clients. To change the settings for the cookies Smaato sets on your devices through the Smaato Websites, please visit our Cookie Policy.
a. Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising from Cookies
You can opt-out of many of the publishers, platforms and service providers we work with that support online interest-based advertising from cookies or similar technologies by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer education and opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info (or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are located in the European Union). Some of our publisher Clients have their own opt-out mechanisms that are linked from their websites or their online-posted privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of those companies for these opt-out links if you no longer wish to receive targeted advertising from a certain company, or multiple companies. You can also click below to opt-out of having the Smaato Ad services used to select ads for your browser based on your online web browsing behavior. When you opt-out, an opt-out cookie (from smaato.net) will be stored in your web browser. Our platform will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt-out cookie, and will apply your choice to all companies using Smaato Ad services for online interest-based advertising from cookies. Please note: This type of opt-out is cookie-based, which means that if you block cookies, upgrade your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to opt-out again. Also, in order for your opt-out choice to be effective, you must ensure that your browser is set to accept third-party cookies such as the Smaato opt-out cookie. Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, and you may need to change your browser settings to accept third-party cookies before opting out. If you use a different device or browser, or erase cookies from your browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Even if you opt-out, Smaato may continue to collect data for other purposes and you still will receive advertising from the Smaato Ad Service when you visit websites of a publisher Client who uses our Platform – but such advertising will not be personalized to you.
b. Opting Out of Cross-App Advertising on Mobile Devices
You can opt-out of having your Mobile IDs used for certain types of interest-based mobile advertising (also called “cross-app advertising”), including those performed by Smaato, by accessing the settings on your Apple or Android mobile device, as follows:
Apple Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt-out of most cross-app advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher and enabling “Limit Ad Tracking.”
iOS 7 and Higher: Go to Settings → Privacy → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
iOS 6: Go to Settings → General → About → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
Android Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt-out of most cross-app advertising by going to Google Settings → Ads, and selecting the option to opt-out of interest-based ads.
Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above instructions may change, and the precise language may be different on certain (particularly, on older) devices. Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described above, please check the settings for those devices.
c. Additional Choices
Advertisers may also provide ways for you to opt-out from, or limit their collection of, certain information from and about you. Please refer to the privacy policies for retailers, apps, and mobile websites to learn more about their privacy practices. You may opt-out from receiving promotional emails from us, such as emails to inform you about events and new services, by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any promotional email you receive, or by contacting us at
marketing@smaato.com
*protected email*
. Please note, however, that we may still send you non-promotional emails relating to your relationship with us.
5. Privacy Practices for the Smaato Websites
a. Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
The Smaato Websites provide information regarding Smaato and our products and services. Through the Smaato Websites, we collect the information you voluntarily disclose to us, and we may also obtain automatically-collected information.
i. Information You Disclose to Us
When registering for an account, expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about Smaato or our products and services, or otherwise contacting us through the Smaato Websites, we collect the information you voluntarily disclose to us, such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and other billing information. You may also provide us with certain information about your business or other individuals.
ii. Automatically-Collected Information
When you visit the Smaato Websites, we may use cookies and pixel tags that we associate with unique identifiers to keep track of visitor interactions and personalize your experience on the Smaato Websites. For more information, please see Section 3 above, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs.” We may also use third-party services, such as Google Analytics, that gather information such as your IP address, browser type, the web page from which you came to the Smaato Websites, and the times of your visit. In addition, as you browse the Smaato Websites, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can “remember” your interests. Our display advertising partners may then help us retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the Smaato Websites. To opt-out of such interest-based mobile advertising, please see Section 4 above, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.” Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving ads; rather, the ads you see will be less customized to you.
b. How We Use Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
In addition to the uses described elsewhere in this Policy, we use the information we collect through the Smaato Websites (alone or in combination) to provide, market, improve, and operate the Smaato Websites, Smaato Ad Services, and any other products or services we have or may develop. This includes use of the information to:
Fulfill your requests;
Send information about our products and services, including marketing communications;
Respond to your questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;
Create aggregated or de-identified information;
Comply with applicable laws, prevent fraud, mitigate risk, and perform similar purposes;
Understand usage trends and preferences;
Analyze, improve, and provide products and services;
Customize the content and advertising you see on the Smaato Websites, across the Internet, and elsewhere; and/or
Perform other purposes at your request.
c. How We Share Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
We may share the information we collect through the Smaato Websites in the following situations:
With your consent, including through this Policy;
With our affiliates;
With third parties that help us to operate our business and provide our services, such as entities that provide us with technical, customer, billing, administrative, event planning, marketing, or operational services;
As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence);
When required by law or in response to lawful process, such as a subpoena, or to cooperate in good faith with a request from a government or law enforcement agency or official, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement;
If we believe sharing the information may prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury, or loss; or
If we believe sharing the information is necessary to protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
With respect to aggregated or de-identified information, we may share such information without restriction.
d. Analytics Services
For the purpose of designing our website in line with your needs, evaluating it from a business management perspective, controlling it and continuously optimizing our pages, we use services described in more detail below on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) and f) GDPR. All of the mentioned processing operations result in a transfer of data to the servers of the providers of tracking or targeting technologies commissioned by us. Some of these servers are located in the USA. The data transfer is based on so-called standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles and and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the/or Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles. If you do not agree with the storage and evaluation of your data, you can object to the storage and processing of your data in the consent banner on our website. In this case, a so-called opt-out cookie will be stored in your browser, which means that the services used will not process any session data. However, you may then no longer be able to use all the functions on our websites. You can also prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of our websites to their full extent.
Google reCAPTCHA
We use the reCaptcha service of Google LLC (“Google”), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, to protect us from spam and misuse. We use this processing on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. This service serves to distinguish whether an entry was made by a human being or abusively by automated, machine processing. To determine this, Google places a cookie in your browser when you use the reCaptcha service and collects and processes the following data:
Referrer URL (address of the page on which the captcha is used)
Browser, browser size and resolution, browser plug-ins, date, language setting
Mouse- or Touch-Events within the reCaptcha box
Assignment to a Google account (if you are currently logged in to Google when using the reCaptcha service, this will be recognized and assigned)
Your input behaviour (e.g. answering the reCAPTCHA question, input speed into the form fields, order of selection of input fields by the user) is processed to improve pattern recognition on Google. Google also reads the cookies from other Google services such as Gmail, Search and Analytics. All of the above data is sent to Google in encrypted form. Google’s subsequent evaluation decides in which form the captcha is displayed on the page – in the form of a checkbox or by text input. A readout or saving of personal data from the input fields of the respective form does not take place. Further information about Google’s privacy policy can be found at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ .
Google Analytics – Google Universal Analytics
Smaato uses Google Universal Analytics, a web analytics tool from Google and we have a privacy agreement with Google. Google uses Cookies. The information generated by the Cookies on the use of the Smaato website by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, Smaato has activated the IP anonymization, so that your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before this happens. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of Smaato, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services to us in connection with the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. We use this processing on the basis of Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f) GDPR for range measurement and evaluation (so-called statistics). In this case there is no further processing of your data for marketing or retargeting purposes. This serves the business optimization of our processes. If you have given your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR), we will also process your data for marketing purposes. You can find more information on terms of use and data protection at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms or https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended by the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” in order to ensure the anonymous processing of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). If you do not agree with the processing of your data by Google Analytics, you can object here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
6. Data Access and Retention
Generally speaking, we retain the information collected from the Smaato Websites and Smaato Ad Services for as long as necessary to achieve our objectives as detailed in this Policy, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), California, or Virginia, you may obtain a copy of the information we have about you, and correct or amend such information, by contacting us at
datarights@smaato.com
*protected email*
or by submitting a request to our online web form. You may read more about this and other rights in Section 11 below.
7. Data Security
We have administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in place in our physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks that are designed to protect the information from loss, misuse, or alteration. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information. To assist with data security, you understand that YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF ANY ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS THAT CAN BE USED TO ACCESS ANY ACCOUNT WITH SMAATO. ANY ACTIONS TAKEN USING YOUR ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS ARE YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY.
8. Third-Party Websites and Apps
This Policy only applies to the Smaato Websites and the Smaato Ad Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of websites, developers, or apps that access or use the Smaato Websites or Smaato Ad Services. Likewise, when you access the Smaato Websites, you may be directed to other websites that are also beyond our control. We encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such third parties and websites, and the industry tools that we have referenced in this Policy.
9. Users from Outside the United States
The Smaato Websites and Smaato Ad Services are provided, supported, and hosted in the United States, and their operation is governed by United States law. If you are using the Smaato Websites or Smaato Ad Services from outside the United States, be aware that your Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States and other countries where our facilities are located. The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Smaato Websites or Smaato Ad Services, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share your information as described in this Policy. Please see Section 11 below, titled “The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)” for additional information we provide for the benefit of residents of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK.
10. California Privacy Notice
Please see our California Privacy Notice for California Consumers
here
.
11. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
As of May 25, 2018, a new data privacy law known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) will be in effect through the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. The GDPR requires Smaato and those using our services to provide users with certain information about the processing of their “Personal Data.” “Personal Data” is a term used under the GDPR that means, generally, data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for instance, names, addresses, and Mobile IDs. To comply with the GDPR, we provide the below representations and information, which are specific to persons located in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK and to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of Smaato, Inc., Barcastraße 5, 22087 Hamburg, Germany.
a. Legal Grounds for Processing Personal Data
The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we are relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Sections 1 and 2 above (and Section 5 as to the Smaato Websites) will typically be because:
You provided your consent.
In order to store and gain access to information stored on your device, we rely on your consent. For this “cookie consent” (which applies not only to “cookies” but also to Mobile IDs), we rely on mobile app developers and oblige them contractually to pass on only legally obtained data. We do so to fulfill our obligations under the ePrivacy Directive. We may choose to obtain consent in other cases as well, in which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to such consent and its withdrawal;
The processing is in our legitimate interest.
In some cases, we rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data, in order to provide our and/or other data controllers’ services. Such processing goes beyond the original collection of Mobile IDs. A legitimate interest we rely on, for instance, is the tailoring of promotional communications within mobile apps and services, which is beneficial to End Users and is an integral part of the ecosystem by which freely available content is funded through advertising revenue. This also may include providing analysis of and reporting about ad campaigns. We also rely on legitimate interest when we use Personal Data to maintain the security of our services, such as to detect fraud or to ensure that bugs are detected and fixed;
Contractual relationships.
Sometimes, we process certain data as necessary under a contractual relationship we have (such as our customer records and contact information);
Legal obligations.
Finally, some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
b.	Transfers of Personal Data
As Smaato is a global company and works with other global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided. For instance, we may transfer your data to third parties that we work with who may be located in jurisdictions outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, and which may have data protection laws that are less strict in comparison to those in Europe. When we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data. Your Personal Data will only be transferred to third countries outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK within the legally permissible framework. We transfer Personal Data to third countries outside the EU/EEA (a) as stipulated by law or based on your consent, (b) based on the adequacy decisions of the European Commission (a public and updated list of these countries can be found here) and (c) by contractual regulations such as the EU Standard Data Protection Clauses (a public and updated list of these clauses can be found here). These safeguards shall ensure an adequate level of protection of your Personal Data and you can access further details regarding these safeguards upon request. Smaato, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Smaato has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Smaato has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.

Further, Smaato is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Smaato commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU and UK individuals and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
. or at the contact information in Section 14 below, titled “Contacting Us,” and we will work with you to resolve your issue. If you are a resident of the EU, UK, or Switzerland, you may also contact your appropriate European Data Protection Authority, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, respectively, with questions or complaints about our privacy practices. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, we also commit to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, the international division of the American Arbitration Association (“ICDR-AAA”), an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, you may, under certain circumstances, invoke binding arbitration; please notify us at
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
and/or please visit
https://www.icdr.org/dpf
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of IDCR-AAA are provided at no cost to you.
c.	Personal Data Retention
As a general matter, we retain your Personal Data for only as long as necessary to provide our Smaato Ad Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. We generally render Mobile IDs inactive within 13 months, provided that we may retain them if we have a legal or significant operational need to do so, such as for auditing, corporate record-keeping, compliance accounting, or bug-fixes. If you are a Client of ours and thus have an account with us, we will typically retain your business-to-business Personal Data for a period of 3 years after you have requested that your account be closed, or such account has been inactive.
d.	Your Rights as a Data Subject
The GDPR provides you with certain rights in respect to Personal Data that data controllers hold about you, including certain rights to access Personal Data, to request correction of the Personal Data, to request to restrict or delete Personal Data, and to object to our processing of your Personal Data (including profiling for online ad targeting).
Right to Access:
If you wish to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller, you may do so by requesting access through the e-mail address
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
. When we receive your request, we will provide you with current, step-by-step instructions to follow in order to obtain access. We will then assess requests to exercise data access rights on a case-by-case basis; in doing so, we consider the difficulty of verifying whether a mobile identifier and data we have linked to it truly and solely belongs to the data subject making the request, as well as the potential adverse effects on disclosure of personal data to the wrong individual. Because such improper disclosure would likely adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the data subject, we may limit the Personal Data we make available. Please note that we will only grant requests submitted via email for Personal Data for which we are a data controller, as explained further below. Where we act as a data processor for one of our Clients, we will refer your request to that Client. Please identify the Client your request refers to (if possible), to simplify this process.
Right to Correct:
If you wish to exercise your right to correct Personal Data, you may do so by contacting us at the contact information below.
Right to Object to Processing or to Withdraw Consent:
By using the device-based “opt-out” signals described in Section 4(b) above, you may withdraw consent for processing on which we rely on consent. If you do so, we will cease processing your Personal Data for purposes of our services within 30 days or less. We either collect these opt-out signals ourselves or receive them from the mobile apps we work with.
Right to Erasure.
You also have the right to obtain the erasure of Personal Data concerning you that we hold as a data controller. The above opt-out process satisfies this right. When an End User opts-out through device settings, and we receive this signal from our Clients, the Personal Data we use to provide our services will be deleted within 30 days (if you have an Android device) or permanently rendered disconnected to your device (if you have an iOS device). We will also manually delete your Personal Data, subject our identity verification process mentioned above, if you prefer that we do so; please contact us at
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
for further instructions on exercising this right manually. Please note, however, that we may retain copies of certain Personal Data on inactive or backup files, for our own internal and necessary purposes, such as auditing, accounting and billing, legal, or bug detection. We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill any important purposes that we have in retaining it, principally regarding legal, auditing, accounting, and billing obligations.
Right to Lodge Complaints.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. However, we hope that you will first consult with us, so that we may work with you to resolve any complaint or concern you might have.
e.	Smaato as a Data Controller and a Data Processor
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, we encourage you to direct your inquiry to the relevant data controller, since data controllers hold primary responsibility for your Personal Data. Smaato may act as either a data controller or a data processor in handling your Personal Data, depending on the precise circumstances. For instance, for Personal Data that we use internally and independently to operate the Smaato Ad Services, and for Personal Data that we collect about our Clients, we are a data controller. If Smaato is acting as a data Controller, it remains primarily liable where this data is passed to third parties. But when we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our Clients or Partners in order to provide our services to them, we are a data processor. Thus, for instance, if you have questions about data that is used primarily by a mobile app on which our technology is embedded – or companies that serve ads that use our technology – you should contact those companies regarding questions about the Personal Data they handle and control.

The connection data is also stored in internal logfiles for the purposes described above, temporarily and limited in content to what is absolutely necessary, in order to find the cause and take action in the event of repeated or criminal requests that endanger the stability and security of our website. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. Art. 6 para. 1, letter b GDPR.
The logfiles are generally stored for a few days and then anonymised. Exceptionally, individual logfiles and IP addresses are kept longer in order to prevent further attacks from this IP address in the event of cyber attacks and/or to take action against the attackers by way of criminal prosecution.
Contact
If you contact us, e.g. via our contact form, we only process your personal data, e.g. name, e-mail address, phone number (‘contact data’) and the content of the conversation (‘communication data’), for communication with you. The legal basis for this is Art. Art. 6 para. 1 letter b GDPR, insofar as your information is required to answer your enquiry or to initiate or execute a contract, and otherwise Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR due to our legitimate interest that you contact us and that we can answer your enquiry.
We only make promotional telephone calls if you have given your consent for this. If you are not an existing customer, we will only send you promotional e-mails on the basis of your consent. In these cases, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 letter a GDPR in conjunction with. § 7 para. 2 no. 1 or 2 UWG (German Act against Unfair Competition, German: Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb).
The contact and communication data will be deleted after we have completed processing your request, unless we need your request to fulfill other contractual or legal obligations.
Newsletter
You can subscribe to our newsletter, with which we will regularly inform you about news on our products and campaigns. You can also unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time. The corresponding unsubscribe link is included in every newsletter. For this purpose, it is also sufficient to send a message to the contact details provided above or in the newsletter.
The following data such as e-mail address, the time of registration and the IP address used for registration (‘subscription data’) are stored during your active subscription and a limited time after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. The storage serves the sole purpose of being able to send you the newsletters and to be able to prove your registration.
The legal basis for this processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 letter a GDPR.
Our newsletters use standard market technologies that enable the measurement of interactions with the newsletters (e.g. opening the email or activating links, ‘interaction data’). We use this data in pseudonymised form for general statistical evaluations and to optimize and further develop our content and customer communication. This is done by means of small graphics embedded in the newsletters (so-called pixels) that establish a connection to the server of the pixel when the e-mail is opened. Furthermore, we use links that first register a click on the link and then redirect to the desired target page. Our newsletter serves to share content relevant to our customers and to better understand what interests our readers. Your interaction data is stored until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. If you do not wish to have your user behavior analyzed, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time (see above), or permanently deactivate the display of graphics and the output of HTML content in your email programme and do not click on any links.
The legal basis for the newsletter tracking is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 letter a GDPR. Access to the information in the terminal device is then based on the implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU member states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 1 TDDDG.
Job Applications, Talent Pool and Active Sourcing
You can use our Career Portal to apply for open positions. The corresponding data is collected for the purpose of applicant selection and the possible establishment of an employment relationship. In order to accept and process your application, we collect personal data, e.g., your first and last name, your e-mail address, application documents (e.g., certificates, CV), the earliest possible date you can start work and your salary expectations, LinkedIn profile name (‘applicant data’).
Furthermore, we will use your given LinkedIn profile name in the application to consider your public and freely accessible data within the application process, where applicable.
The legal basis for processing your applicant data is Art. Art. 6 para. 1 letter b and Art. Art. 88 para. 1 GDPR in conjunction with Section Art. 26 para. 1 sentence 1 BDSG (German Federal Data Protection Act, German: Bundesdatenschutzgesetz).
We store your personal data upon receipt of your application. If we accept your application and an employment relationship is established, we store your application data for as long as it is required for the employment relationship and to the extent that legal regulations justify an obligation to store it.
If we reject your application, we will store your application data for a maximum of three months after rejecting your application, unless you give us your consent to store it for a longer period.
If you have separately given us your consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 letter a GDPR, we will store your data submitted as part of the application in our Talent Pool for a further fifteen months after the end of the application process in order to identify any other interesting positions for you and, if necessary, to approach you again. After this period, the data will be deleted. You can withdraw this consent at any time with effect for the future.
For our Career Portal and Talent Pool we use our service provider Greenhouse Software Inc., 228 Park Avenue S, PMB 14744, New York, NY 10003-1502, USA, with which we have concluded a data processing agreement. Furthermore, Greenhouse Software Inc. is certified for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, so that the transfer to the USA is governed by an adequacy decision according to Art. 45 GDPR.
Sometimes we proactively look for candidates for our open positions online and may then obtain your personal information from sources like LinkedIn or XING or other professional networks where you have published your profile. We may then store some of your data (such as name, link to your profile) in our database and contact you to inform you about our open positions. If there are no open positions at the moment, we ask your consent to store the data in the Talent Pool. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 letter 7 GDPR where data processing is based on our legitimate interest and Art. 6 Para. 1 letter a GDPR where the data processing is based on your consent.
Use of cookies and similar technologies
This website uses various services and applications (‘tools’) that are offered either by us or by third parties. These include, in particular, tools that use technologies to store or access information in the device:
Cookies
: small text files that your browser stores on your terminal device, consisting in particular of a name, a value, the storing domain and an expiry date. So-called session cookies (e.g. PHPSESSID) are deleted after the session, while so-called persistent cookies are deleted after the specified expiry date. Cookies can also be removed manually.
Web storage
(local storage / session storage): information stored on the device, consisting of a name and a value. Information in session storage is deleted after the session, while information in local storage has no expiry date and remains stored unless a mechanism for deletion has been set up (e.g. storage of a local storage with a time entry). Information in local and session storage can also be removed manually.
JavaScript
: Programming codes (scripts) embedded or called up in the website that, for example, set cookies and web storage or actively collect information from the device or about the user behavior of visitors. JavaScript may be used for ‘active fingerprinting’ and the creation of user profiles. JavaScript can be blocked by a setting in the browser, although most services will then no longer work.
Pixel
: tiny graphics automatically loaded by a service that can make it possible to recognise visitors by automatically transmitting the usual connection data and, for example, to determine whether an email has been opened or a website visited. With the help of pixels, ‘passive fingerprinting’ and the creation of user profiles can be carried out. The use of pixels can be prevented, for example, by blocking images, such as in emails, although the design is then severely restricted.
The tools are used for the following purposes and categories:
Essential
: Essential services enable basic functions and are necessary for the proper function of the website. These include especially consent management platforms.
Statistics
: Statistics services process usage information, enabling us to recognize you as a visitor, to analyze user behavior, to gain insights into how our visitors interact with our website, and to adjust and optimize our website upon our usage evaluations.
Marketing
: Marketing services are used by third-party advertisers or publishers to display personalized ads, to retarget you, to create audiences, and to evaluate our advertising campaigns. They do this by tracking and recognizing visitors across websites, and by creating usage profiles about your clicked advertisements and interests.
External Media
: Content from video platforms and social media platforms is blocked by default. If External Media services are accepted, access to those contents no longer requires manual consent. Providers of embedded content and media may track your use of it for personalization and marketing purposes.
The legal basis for Essential tools is Art. Art. 6 para. 1 letter b and f GDPR. The access to and storage of information on the device is absolutely necessary in these cases and takes place on the basis of the implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU member states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 2 TTDSG. In this regard, we especially use the Elementor WordPress Page Builder to provide and maintain our essential website functions; this includes the storage of the “elementor” information on your device’s web storage.
The legal basis for Statistics, Marketing and External Media tools is Art. 6 para. 1 letter a GDPR. The access to and storage of information in the device is then based on the implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU member states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 1 TTDSG.
The data collected includes in particular:
network data (e.g. IP address),
usage data (e.g. visited sites),
event data (e.g. clicked buttons),
identifiers
approximate location data,
language,
device data (e.g. information about browser, and operating system, device, resolution).
You can manage your tool selection and withdraw your consent in our consent banner, which you can open with the icon in the lower left corner. There you can also find detailed information about the provider of the tools and our marketing partners, about the specific purposes of the tools, the data processed and the information stored on the device.
III. Transfer of your data
The data we collect about you will only be transferred if there is a legal basis for this in the specific case, in particular if:
you have given your explicit consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 letter a GDPR,
the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR is necessary to protect our interests or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding interest worthy of protection in not disclosing your data,
we are legally obliged to disclose your data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 letter c GDPR, in particular if this is necessary for legal prosecution or enforcement due to binding requirements (e.g. in the context of tax audits by the tax authorities), official enquiries, court orders and legal proceedings, or
this is legally permissible and required pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter b GDPR for the processing of contractual relationships with you or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request.
Some of the data processing may be carried out by our service providers. In addition to the service providers mentioned in this privacy policy, these may include, in particular, data centers, software providers (e.g. for logfile management or sending newsletters), IT service providers, help desks, agencies, market research companies and consultancies. If we pass on data to our service providers, they may only use data to fulfill their tasks. Service providers are carefully selected and commissioned by us.
Furthermore, we share your data with our group companies on the basis of a joint controller agreement to perform jointly determined purposes for our services, including especially the customer management, campaign management, trading management, product development, and analytics. For all aspects regarding this joint processing of data with our group companies, we are your preferred contact point.
We may use services whose providers are partly located in so-called third countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic Area) or transfer personal data there, i.e. countries whose level of data protection does not correspond to that of the European Union.
If there is an adequacy decision by the European Commission (Art. 45 GDPR) for these countries, we base the data transfer on this. This applies, for example, to transfers to Argentina, Israel, Japan, Canada, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay or the United Kingdom. In the case of the USA, this only applies if the US recipient has certified itself for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.
Where the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision for these countries, we have taken appropriate precautions to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data transfers. These include, among others, the standard contractual clauses of the European Union or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 46 GDPR).
Where this is not possible, we base the transfer of data on exceptions to Art. 49 GDPR, in particular your express consent or the necessity of the transfer for the performance of the contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
If a third country transfer is provided for and no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards are in place, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the respective third country (e.g. intelligence services) may gain access to the transferred data in order to collect and analyze it, and that enforceability of your data subject rights cannot be guaranteed. When obtaining your explicit consent, you will also be informed of this.
IV. Online presence in social networks
We maintain online presences in social networks in order to communicate there with customers and interested parties, among others, and to provide information about our products and services.
Processing for advertising purposes of the social network providers
The users’ data is usually processed by the social networks concerned for market research and advertising purposes. In this way, usage profiles can be created based on the interests of the users. For this purpose, cookies and other identifiers are stored on the computers of the data subjects. Based on these usage profiles, advertisements, for example, are then placed within the social networks but also on third-party websites.
For the legal basis of the data processing carried out by the social networks under their own responsibility, please refer to the data protection information of the respective social network. The following links will also provide you with further information on the respective data processing and the options to object.
Processing for statistics
As part of the operation of our online presences, it is possible that we may access information such as statistics on the use of our online presences provided by the social networks. These statistics are aggregated and may include, in particular, demographic information (e.g., age, gender, region, country) as well as data on interaction with our online presences (e.g. likes, subscription, sharing, viewing of images and videos) and the posts and content distributed via them. This may also provide information about the interests of users and which content and topics are particularly relevant to them. This information may also be used by us to adapt the design and our activities and content on the online presence and optimise it for our audience. Please see the list below for details and links to the social network data that we, as operators of the online presences, can access. The collection and use of these statistics is usually subject to joint responsibility. Where applicable, the relevant agreement is listed below.
The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR, based on our legitimate interest in effective information and communication with users, and Art. 6 para. 1 letter b GDPR, in order to stay in contact with and inform our customers, as well as to carry out pre-contractual measures with interested parties.
Access to publicly available information
Where you have an account with the social network, it is possible that we may see your publicly available information (e.g. profile name) and media (e.g. pictures and videos) when we access your profile. In addition, the social network may allow us to contact you. This may be, for example, via direct messages or via posted articles. The content communication via the social network and the processing of the content data is thereby subject to the responsibility of the social network as a messenger and platform service. For this processing, we refer to the data protection information of the respective social network.
Processing of publicly available information
As soon as we transfer or process personal data from you into our own systems, we are independently responsible for this. The processing is done to carry out pre-contractual measures and to fulfill a contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 letter b GDPR or to pursue our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR in order to contact customers.
Data subject rights
We would like to point out that data protection requests can be asserted most efficiently with the respective provider of the social network, as only these providers have access to the data and can take appropriate measures directly. Of course, you can also contact us with your request. In this case, we will process your request and forward it to the provider of the social network.
Our online presences
Below is a list of information about the social networks on which we operate online presences:

V. Storage period
We store your personal data only as long as it is necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which we have collected your data. Thereafter, we delete your data immediately, unless we need your data as evidence for civil law purposes or until the statutory retention periods expire  or there is another legal basis under data protection law for the continued processing of your data in the specific individual case.
We are obliged to store your contractual data for evidence purposes for three years after the end of the year in which our business relationship with you ends. Any claims become statute-barred at the earliest time permitted under the statutory limitation period.
However, for accounting or other legally prescribed purposes, it may be necessary for us to store your data for longer. We may be obliged to do so due to legal documentation obligations, e.g. in Germany according to the German Commercial Code (HGB) or the German Fiscal Code (AO). The periods specified there for the retention of documents are two to ten years.
VI. Your rights
You have the rights of data subjects set out in Art. 7 para. 3, Art. 15 – 22 GDPR at any time if the respective legal requirements are met:
You have the right to obtain information about the processing of your personal data by us at any time. We will explain the data processing to you and give you an overview of the personal data we store about you (Art. 15 GDPR).
If your personal data stored with us is incorrect or no longer up to date, you have the right to have this data corrected (Art. 16 GDPR).
You also have the right to have your data deleted (Art. 17 GDPR). If deletion is not possible due to other legal requirements, your data will be blocked so that it is only available for the legally prescribed purposes.
You also have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data (Art. 18 GDPR) if, for example, you dispute the accuracy of the data.
You also have the right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR), i.e. we will provide you with a digital copy of your personal data stored with us upon request.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects you, including, where applicable, the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express your point of view and to contest the decision (Art. 22 GDPR).
Right of withdrawal (Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR):
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This means that we will no longer process the data based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the withdrawal.
Right of objection (Art. 21 GDPR):
General objection: If we process your data on the basis of legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your data at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation.
Objection for direct marketing: If it is a matter of objecting to the processing of data for direct marketing purposes, you have a general right of objection, which will also be implemented by us without giving reasons.
Assertion of your rights:
If you wish to exercise your right of withdrawal or objection, it is sufficient to send an informal message to the above contact details.
Finally, you have the right to complain to any data protection supervisory authority. You can assert this right, for example, with a supervisory authority in the member state of your place of residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. In Berlin, where we are based, the competent supervisory authority is: Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Alt-Moabit 59-61, 10555 Berlin.
To exercise your rights described here, you can contact us at any time using the contact details above. This also applies if you wish to receive copies of guarantees demonstrating an adequate level of data protection. Provided that the respective legal requirements are met, we will comply with your data protection request.
Your enquiries regarding the assertion of data protection rights and our responses to them will be stored for documentation purposes for a period of up to three
years and, in individual cases, for a longer period if there are grounds for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR, based on our interest in defending against any civil claims under Art. 82 GDPR, avoiding fines under Art. 83 GDPR and fulfilling our accountability obligations under Art. 5 para. 2 GDPR.

Services Privacy Policy
Information collected through our Services related to End Users: Yieldmo partners with numerous companies to support our business customers (our “Customers”) in providing online advertisements to end users of mobile websites, mobile applications (“Apps) and other online media (“End Users”). As an End User browses the Internet or uses Apps that include references to the Service, the End User’s browser or device may request advertisements from Yieldmo’s system. When Yieldmo receives these requests, and/or when Yieldmo delivers advertisements to such browser or device, we may collect information about these interactions (as well as any further interaction with the advertisements provided by the Service such as views, clicks, conversions, etc.).
This may include, for example:
IP address;
Unique identifiers sent to us from web browsers, mobile devices, network carriers or data providers;
Information contained in HTTP headers or other internet transfer protocol signals;
‘Hashed’ information (such as email addresses or usernames that are pseudonymized so as to be no longer associated with an individual’s name or email address);
Demographic information such as a user’s gender, age, and income range;
Attributes of computer or device usage, such as advertisements clicked, websites and content areas visited;
Date and time of advertisement request, and advertisement delivery and interaction activities;
Browser type and version; operating system;
language setting;
information about or from the presence or use of Apps on a mobile device; and
location including GPS location of your device if you have opted to provide it to Yieldmo or to one of Yieldmo’s publisher or third party data provider partners.
Some information collected through our Services may be considered ‘sensitive’ or ‘health data’ as defined by applicable law. For example, Yieldmo may collect certain general health-related information in delivering advertisements based on inferred End User interest in these topics based on sites or ads with which the End User previously interacted. This may include information related to general health, wellness, common ailments and illnesses, or beauty and fitness. We may receive health-related targeting data segments from third party data companies. As an example, Yieldmo may use health-related segments from those third parties such as “Beauty, Health & Fitness > Health, Diets & Nutrition” (Click
here
for a representative list of such health segments).
On occasion, we may also receive information from third-parties that enables advertisement optimization, independently of or in combination with the information collected by Yieldmo, such as audience interest segments and product categories.
From time to time, advertisements served by Yieldmo may contain functionality that enables an End User to enter personal information into such advertisements, in order to allow the End User to sign-up for or receive information regarding a product or service offered by an advertiser. In the event that an End User elects to provide personal information under such circumstances, we may collect such information on behalf of such advertiser or its agency.
Information collected through our Services related to our Customers
In order to serve our Customers, we will collect various information through our software and customer support channels, including:
Customer registration information. If you register to use the Website or Service as a business customer (e.g., as an advertiser, agency or publisher), we ask for and store information you provide such as your email, first name, last name, company name, username, address and phone number (collectively, “Registration Data”).
Campaign Information. After our Customers register to use the Website or Service, they may set up advertising campaigns and other account parameters.
Corporate email addresses for email correspondence;
Chat correspondence, which may include any personal information provided during a chat session;
Billing and administrative finance information;
Information about how our Customers use our software products and services, including time spent on our applications, behavioral activity, and metadata associated with software interactions.
How we use your information
Collected information may be used to provide the Services to our Customers such as by providing purchasing opportunities and aggregate reports to advertisers, agencies, and publishers who participate in the Yieldmo Service; to schedule, deliver, and optimize advertisements; to use or create audience interest segments and categories; to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping); to provide advertisements only to certain types of mobile devices; to anonymously track sales and conversions; to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity; to administer and enhance the Service; and to help Yieldmo display, optimize, target and/or customize advertisements to the interests or preferences of End Users.
Yieldmo may use certain general health-related information in delivering advertisements based on inferred End User interest in these topics based on sites or ads with which the End User previously interacted.
For example, a user who views content related to parenting might later be shown an ad for children’s clothing or accessories.
Similarly, a user who views content related to fitness might later be shown ads related to exercise-related apps.
We may also utilize health-related targeting data segments provided by third party data companies.
As an example, Yieldmo may use health-related segments from those third parties such as “Beauty, Health & Fitness > Health, Diets & Nutrition” (Click
here
for a representative list of such health segments).
We may, in accordance with our
Ad Policy
, accept certain political advertising and target such advertising based upon region, or contextually based upon the content of the page on which the advertising will be displayed (e.g. news page). We do not currently use audience segments in connection with political advertising.
In addition, collected information may be used to conduct internal analysis, account management and maintenance, perform billing, invoicing and payment functions in connection with your account, send services-related information, alerts and promotional messages to you, and maintain and improve the performance of the Website and Service. We may also use this information to offer personalized features, including varying the content you receive in future visits to the Website based on your preferences and activities.
Subject to the terms of our Customer agreements, we may also use personal information for any legal purpose necessary, including IP protection and where Yieldmo is required to process information as a result of a court order or other legal or regulatory proceeding.
How we disclose your information
Any End User-volunteered personal information that is entered by an End User into an advertising unit which we receive pursuant to this Policy may be disclosed to the applicable advertiser or its agency on behalf of whom such information was collected. The End User should review the advertiser’s privacy policy to understand how the advertiser will process such personal information.
We may disclose the above types of information with our Customers, affiliates, third party partners and agents. For example, we may disclose information to analyze the performance of advertisements, provide reporting to advertisers and clients, improve advertisement targeting on our platform, improve our products and services, and enable third party partners (such as Google) to improve advertisement targeting across their respective services and platforms and otherwise use the information for their lawful business purposes.
In addition, we may disclose information for a designated business purpose, including:
With your consent.
With vendors who help us provide our Services.
With any other divisions, subsidiaries or corporate affiliates of Yieldmo.
If we are compelled by law to do so, such as through a subpoena or court order.
If it is required as part of a business transaction where Yieldmo or any subsidiary is acquired.
We may disclose aggregated information for any purpose. This means that the information we disclose does not identify specific individuals, or is combined with other data to protect your privacy.
Your choices with our information uses
If you are a current or former employee of one of our Customers, or believe your information was uploaded to us by one of our Customers, and you would like to fulfill your rights to the personal information we maintain about you on behalf of our Customer, please contact a representative of that Customer rather than email us with your request.

5. Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not
               in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. Amazon Europe
               shares customers' personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com,
               Inc. and the subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
               this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described
               in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions involving third parties:
We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by
                        third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products
                        from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application
                        providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services.
                        We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses,
                        such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
                        transactions and we share customer personal information related to those transactions
                        with that third party.
Third party service providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                        include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal
                        mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data,
                        providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
                        listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and managing
                        credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have
                        access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use
                        it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance
                        with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.
Business transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or
                        services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
                        business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
                        Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely
                        event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
                        information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Amazon Europe and others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate
                        to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements;
                        or protect the rights, property or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This
                        includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection
                        and credit risk reduction.
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about
                        you might be shared with third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose
                        not to share the information.
Transfers out of the European Economic Area and the UK.
Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic
            Area or the UK, we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
            Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection. We rely
            on European Commission adequacy decisions or use contracts with standard safeguards
            published by the European Commission (you can ask
Customer Service
for a copy of these) and similar measures under UK laws for such transfers.
6. How Secure is Information About Me?
We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.
We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by
                        using encryption protocols and software.
We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling
                        credit card data.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the
                        collection, storage and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security
                        procedures mean that we may ask you to verify your identity before we disclose personal
                        information to you.
Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorised access and
                        loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs.
                        Click
here
for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and
                        to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password
                        for your Amazon account that is not utilized for other online accounts. Be sure to
                        sign off when you finish using a shared computer. For more information on how to sign
                        off click

7. What About Advertising?
Third-party advertisers and links to other websites:
Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and
                        apps. Third party advertising partners may collect information about you when you
                        interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about
                        third-party advertising at Amazon Europe, including interest-based ads, please read
                        our
Interest-Based Ads notice
. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the
Advertising Preferences page
.
Use of third-party advertising services:
We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more
                        useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share
                        your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead,
                        we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived
                        from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.
                        For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
                        identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download
                        the app again. While we do not share your specific shopping actions like purchases,
                        product views, or searches with ad companies, we may share an advertising identifier
                        and an estimate of the value of the ads they show you on our behalf so they can serve
                        you with more effective Amazon ads. Some ad companies also use this information to
                        serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out
                        of interest-based advertising by going to the
Advertising Preferences page
.
8. What Information Can I Access?

            information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the "Your

9. What Choices Do I Have?

            information, please contact our
Customer Service
. Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options
            as to how your information is being used.
As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information but then you
                        might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the
Information You Can Access?
section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the previous version
                        for our records.

                        your

You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data processing by updating
                        your settings on the applicable Amazon website (e.g., in "Manage Your Content and
                        Devices"), device, or application. For more information click
here
. Most non-Amazon devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions
                        (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls
                        are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change
                        your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you
                        contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer as different devices
                        may have different permission settings.

            to our processing of your personal data or ask that we restrict the processing of
            your personal data in certain instances. If you wish to do any of these things, please

10. Are Children Allowed to Use Amazon Services?
Amazon Europe doesn't sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products
            for purchase by adults. If you're under 18, you may use Amazon Services only with
            the involvement of a parent or guardian. For more information on how we handle personal

11. How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?
We keep your personal information to enable your continued use of Amazon Services,
            for as long as it is required in order to fulfil the relevant purposes described in
            this Privacy Notice, as may be required by law such as for tax and accounting purposes,
            or as otherwise communicated to you. For example, we retain your transaction history
            so that you can review past purchases (and repeat orders if desired) and what addresses
            you have shipped orders to, and to improve the relevancy of products and content we
            recommend.
12. EU-US and Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework
Amazon.com, Inc. and certain of its controlled US
affiliates
(together, the Amazon Group Companies, or "We") participate in the EU-US Data Privacy
            Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and Swiss-US Data
            Privacy Frameworks* regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information
            from European Union and European Economic Area member countries, the United Kingdom,
            and Switzerland. We have certified with the Department of Commerce that we adhere
            to the Data Privacy Framework Principles. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework
            Principles, see
here
.
If you have any inquiries or complaints about our handling of your personal information
            under the Data Privacy Framework, or about our privacy practices generally, please
            contact us at: eu-privacy@amazon.co.uk. We will respond to your inquiry promptly.
            If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily,
            please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge)
            at
https://www.verasafe.com/public-resources/dispute-resolution/submit-dispute/

            arbitration through the Data Privacy Framework Panel. To learn more about the Data
            Privacy Framework Panel, see

As explained
here
we sometimes provide personal information to third parties to perform services on
            our behalf. If we transfer personal information received under the Data Privacy Framework
            to a third party, the third party's access, use, and disclosure of the personal information
            must also be in compliance with our Data Privacy Framework obligations, and we will
            remain liable under the Data Privacy Framework for any failure to do so by the third
            party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
You can review our Data Privacy Framework registration
here
. The Amazon Group Companies are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers
            of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). We may be required to disclose personal information
            that we handle under the Data Privacy Framework in response to lawful requests by
            public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
*
We will not rely on the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework or the UK Extension to the
               EU-US Data Privacy Framework until each enters into force, but we adhere to their
               required commitments in anticipation of their doing so.
13. EU General Data Protection Regulation and UK Data Protection Laws - Legal Basis
The EU GDPR and UK data protection laws require a legal basis for our use of personal
               information. Our basis varies depending on the specific purpose for which we use personal
               information. We use:
Performance of a contract
when we provide you with products or services, or communicate with you about them.
                        This includes when we use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver
                        products and services, and process payments.
Our legitimate business interests and the interests of our customers
when we improve Amazon services (including when we use your voice, video, or camera
                        input to improve services), when we detect and prevent fraud and abuse in order to
                        protect the security of our customers, ourselves, or others, and when we provide you
                        with interest-based advertising.
Your consent
when we ask for your consent to process your personal information for a specific
                        purpose that we communicate to you. When you consent to our processing your personal
                        information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and
                        we will stop processing of your data for that purpose.
Compliance with a legal obligation
when we use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect
                        seller place of establishment and bank account information for identity verification
                        purposes.
These and other legal bases
depending on the purpose for which we use personal information.

            data controllers, please

            the data protection officer for the above mentioned data controllers can be contacted

            Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
            We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our
            policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected
            in the past without the consent of affected customers.
