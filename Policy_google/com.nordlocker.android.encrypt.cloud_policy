What is cloud encryption?
Use NordLocker’s private cloud to secure, back up, and access your files on the web or on desktop and mobile devices.
What is cloud storage?
Cloud storage allows you to store your data on a server rather than your computer. Using cloud storage, you can synchronize data across multiple devices, back it up securely, and free up space on your other devices.
How does cloud storage work?
Use cloud storage like your digital file cabinet. Store private files and synchronize them across devices. Cloud storage is equal parts accessible and secure. If anything happened to your device, restoring data from the cloud is easy.
What makes NordLocker cloud storage unique?
NordLocker uses zero-knowledge architecture for secure storage. It combines AES-256, xChaCha20-Poly1305, and Ed25519 algorithms to optimize file security and privacy. All your items are protected by end-to-end encryption as you add them to the vault.
