children. Whenever we refer to “children” in this Privacy Policy, we mean
children under the age of 13.
We are committed to making sure that kids’ privacy is safeguarded and we
aim to comply with all (privacy) regulations worldwide, like the Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US.
Currently, We does not knowingly collect any personal information from
children or within the child-directed portions of our the Service except as
otherwise outlined in this Privacy Policy. If we were to collect and store
personal information from children, we would obtain the consent of a parent or
legal guardian before such collection, unless the collection of information
falls within an exception that is permitted under COPPA.
In our Apps directed to children users, we may collect information which
includes persistent identifiers such as a device identifier (“device ID”) and
Internet Protocol address (“IP address”). This information is collected solely
for the purpose of providing functionality and support for our internal
operations and optimizing our users’ use experience.
The Service may contain advertisements about our or third party products and services. In any case, Amax Software does not permit behaviorally-targeted advertising to children in the Service where we have actual knowledge that the user is under the age of 13.

collects analytical information to better understand your use of our Apps. We
have explicitly indicated to Unity that our products are aimed at children
under 13 (which means Unity is aware that the handling of information should be
COPPA compliant).
