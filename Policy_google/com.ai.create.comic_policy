Information That Is Processed Automatically
On the basis of your

, we utilize third-party automatic data processing technologies, such as advertising or analytics tools, to analyze specific information sent by your device through our App (Identity For Advertisers for Android ID for Android devices). These technologies may involve automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which refers to automated processing used to evaluate personal aspects related to you, such as preferences, interests, behavior, location, or movements (see the list of data described below). This automated data processing starts once you allow our App to track your activity. However, you can withdraw your permission at any time, and we provide opt-out options in Section VIII for your convenience.
We may process certain information about your device and user behavior based on our legitimate interest. This information falls within the data categories described in the subsection "Information That Is Processed Automatically." It is generally non-personal, meaning it cannot directly associate with any specific individual, and we access it only in aggregated form. This information is used to improve our App and provide the best user experience.
Device Details
: When you use a mobile device (tablet / phone / smartwatch) to access our App, some details about your device are reported, including “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties.
The following data about your device and its usage can be processed:
Information about the device itself: device type, operating system type and version, model, manufacturer, screen size, screen density, orientation, audio volume, and battery usage, device memory usage.

Ad-related information
: Data related to the ads you view may be reported, including the date and time of ad serving, whether an ad was "clicked" or shown as a "conversion" event, the content of the ad offer, the ad type (e.g., text, image, video), ad placement within the App, and your response to the ad.
In-App events

Please note that information provided automatically to advertising or analytics tools is not generally under our control, and we cannot be held responsible for how such information is processed. Some services engaged in personal data profiling may obtain information related to your personality and/or device using technologies beyond our responsibility. For instance, if your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook may use your device information in conjunction with categorized data from their databases (e.g., your age, gender, or other demographic information). We do not supervise or guarantee how third parties process your personal data, especially data collected through means unrelated to our App. If you have any information requests regarding the disclosure of your personal information, kindly direct them to the respective third parties (refer to Section IV for more details).
