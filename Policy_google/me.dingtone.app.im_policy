Privacy Policy
The
dingtone.me
website (the Website or Dingtone Website) and Dingtone mobile
              applications (the Software or Dingtone Software) are owned and
              operated by Dingtone, Inc. ("Dingtone", "us" or "we"). Our Privacy
              Policy explains how we, and some of the companies we work with,
              collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our
              websites and Dingtone Software (collectively, the "Service").
Information We Collect
(1) Contacts Information
You need to allow Dingtone to access your address book on your mobile device. By authorizing the access you can easily send messages and make calls, forward messages and files, share contacts information, or initiate a conference call to your friends and family. A simplified copy of the address book with information such as the name, phone number, and ringtone of each contact will be stored and used to display the identity of the caller who's in the user's contact book(the caller will also be automatically added to the user's Dingtone friend list) in the push notification. We create a cryptographic hash value of the transmitted information to prevent any misuse. The information will not be shared with any third parties and will be removed permanently once the user disables the app.
(2) Personal Information
When you install Dingtone Software on your mobile device, you are required to provide a mobile phone number to receive an access code via SMS. The phone number will be saved on the Dingtone servers. The phone number is also used to discover other Dingtone users who have your phone number in their address book.
When you create a Dingtone account, we may ask for personal information, like your name or email address. We may also collect demographic information, such as age, gender, or preferences. We might also ask you to create a publicly-visible profile, which may include your name and photo. These information might be used to provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing.If you register with a third-party account, we may collect the information such as age, gender, address or portrait from your third-party account and use it to complete your profile on Dingtone.
(3) Location Information
Certain Dingtone features require access to the location information on your mobile phone. Some features, such as "Find Nearby Friends" also store your location information in our servers, and share your location information with other Dingtone users. If you are concerned about the privacy of your location information, we recommend you do not use those features.
(4) Device Information
When you install Dingtone on your device, we may automatically collect certain information(on the premise of having obtained the necessary system permissions) from your device, including an Android, Apple iOS, or other ID, device maker and model, mobile web browser type and version, the operating system’s maker and version, MCC (Mobile Country Code) information, the mobile application name and other technical data about your device to diagnose or fix technology problems.  To provide certain calling/texting service in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we may automatically collect information(on the premise of having obtained the necessary system permissions) including IP address, MAC address, location information, email associated with the device, phone number associated with the device and use them as part of the required identification to detect, investigate, prevent, or address illegal activity.
A list of specific mobile applications installed on your device will also be collected to provide certain features, such as signing in from a third-party service or sharing messages on other third-party apps and services.
The information listed above(phone number associated with the device, etc) may be uploaded and securely stored in our servers and will never be shared with 3rd parties. You can delete the data by deactivating the account or contacting us.
(5) Usage Information
We automatically collect usage information that does not identify an individual user. For example, when you install Dingtone on your device, we automatically collect information such as your device type, operating system version and type, IP address, certain unique device identifiers (such as Android ID, MAC address, and IDFA) and carrier and other information for your device. We use this information to enhance the services we offer and to help us understand how people use the Service.
(6) Analytic Information
We use third-party analytic tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, Dingtone software screens you access, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytic information with analytic information from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.
(7) Cookie and Tracking
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Dingtone uses cookies to help Dingtone identify and track visitors, their usage of the Dingtone website, and their website access preferences. Dingtone visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Dingtone' websites, with the drawback that certain features of Dingtone's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

When you use Dingtone to send a multimedia message (such as sharing a picture, or sharing a video clip), the multimedia content will be cached in Dingtone servers for enhancing the responding speed of our service and increasing the effectiveness of performance. The cached content will be removed after a certain period of months. Dingtone does not provide any means for you to delete the cached content manually.
(9) Share Data
