Welcome to Letterlike! We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our website.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT: We may collect personal information that you provide to us when you create an account, or contact us for support. This information may include your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and payment information. We may also collect certain information automatically when you visit our website, such as your IP address, browser type, and operating system.

COOKIES: Cookies and similar technologies used for analytics help collect data that allows services to understand how you interact with a particular service. These insights allow services to both improve content and build better features that enhance your experience. Some cookies and similar technologies help sites and apps understand how their visitors engage with their services. For example, Letterlike implements Google Analytics, which uses a set of cookies to collect information on behalf of businesses which use the Google Analytics service and report site usage statistics to them without personally identifying individual visitors. ‘_ga’, the main cookie used by Google Analytics, enables the service to distinguish one visitor from another and lasts for 2 years. Any site that implements Google Analytics, including Google services, uses the ‘_ga’ cookie. Each ‘_ga’ cookie is unique to the specific property, so it cannot be used to track a given user or browser across unrelated websites.
