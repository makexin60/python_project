We are Löwenstein.
Löwenstein has been developing and distributing medical technology for over 35 years. Ventilation is our field of expertise. Ventilation always means that life must be saved, preserved, and facilitated. That is our motivation. And our meaning. We are committed to people and to life. As a family-owned business, we see ourselves as a partner to our patients and customers, to whom we guarantee quality: made in Germany. In the clinic or at home. In diagnosis or treatment. We are there. With our knowledge and experience in ventilation and respiratory therapy. The focus is always on people.
For many decades, even before Reinhard Löwenstein joined the company and Heinen moved to Bad Ems, the youngest patients have always been particularly close to our hearts. The ventilation of premature and newborn infants is and remains one of our core competencies, as does our commitment to constant improvement. When little heroes are born prematurely, their delicate bodies need help with every breath. That’s when we are there. Our knowledge and our commitment to people has developed from this highly sensitive form of ventilation. Our expertise in ventilating the most sensitive lungs also helps us provide particularly gentle support in the other ventilation fields, close to the natural breathing processes. With every breath.

d) Mapbox
On our website, we use the Mapbox API of Mapbox Inc, 740 15th Street NW 5th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, USA (hereinafter "Mapbox"). Mapbox is an online mapping tool that is accessed via an interface (API). We used the Mapbox API to display the interactive maps. In the process, the following personal data is processed:

commercial information: application ID, Mapbox customer's ac-count ID, Mapbox product name / version;
internet or other electronic network activity: Timestamp of data elements received and the fact that an end user leaves a particular navigation route or uses an alternative navigation route;
geolocation: e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude, horizontal and vertical accuracy (an IP address is not associated with such location data and the session ID is deleted within 24 hours);
connectivity and device data: Device model and browser information, operating system, and content of an API or SDK request.
By using this tool, among other things, your IP address is transmitted to Mapbox. The collected data is stored and processed on servers of the Mapbox company. For security reasons, your IP address is stored for 30 days and then deleted. Randomly generated IDs (no personal data) that analyze the use of the APIs are deleted after 36 months.
The use is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in ensuring the best possible online presence. If a corresponding consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR and § 25 Para. 1 TDDDG (germand law: Data Protection and Privacy in Telecommunications and Telemedia Act), insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's terminal device (e.g. device fingerprinting) as defined by the TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time.

This serves primarily to distinguish whether the input is made by a natural person or abusively by machine and automated processing. The following information is processed:
hash value (one-way encryption) of the incoming IP address (the IP address is discarded, only the hash value is stored);
HTTP request header data, especially user agent, origin and referrer;
date/time of the request;
version of the widget used;
number of requests from the (hashed) IP address per time period;
answer of the calculation task solved by the visitor's computer.
IP addresses are only stored in hashed (one-way encrypted) form and do not allow us and Friendly Captcha to draw any conclusions about an individual person. If personal data is collected, it will be deleted after 30 days at the latest. Friendly Captcha does not set or read any cookies on the end device of the visitor. The data is used exclusively to protect against spam and bots as described above.
Your data will be deleted immediately after the purpose has been achieved. For more information on the use of Friendly Captcha and the retention periods, please visit
