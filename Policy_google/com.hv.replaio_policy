About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our

, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators

domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.

the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

How Google retains data we collect
Advertising
Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox

How Google uses cookies in advertising
Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).
We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These
server logs
typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
Our advertising cookies
To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.
See more detail about the
types of cookies used by Google
and our partners and
how we use them
.
How you can control advertising cookies
You can use
ad settings
to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.
You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based
aboutads.info choices
page or the EU-based
Your Online Choices
.
Finally, you can
manage cookies in your web browser
.
Other technologies used in advertising
Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the
IP address
, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
Location
Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us.  Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:
Reset your device’s advertising ID
, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
Delete your device’s advertising ID
, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.
To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

iOS
Devices with iOS use Apple’s Advertising Identifier. To learn more about your choices for use of this identifier, visit the
Settings
app on your device.
Connected TV/Over-the-Top
Advertising identifiers for connected TV
Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.
The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:
Reset advertising ID
Delete advertising ID
Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
Your advertising ID (long string)
These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

What determines the ads by Google that I see?
Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.
Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.
Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.
The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.
You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.
Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.
We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.

Zarządzanie reklamami dopasowanymi
Co to są reklamy dopasowane?
Reklamy dopasowane to takie reklamy, które zostały opracowane z wykorzystaniem informacji o Tobie, aby odpowiadały Twoim zainteresowaniom. Są one również znane jako reklamy oparte na zainteresowaniach.
Na przykład dopasowanie reklamy ma miejsce, gdy nasz partner reklamowy posiada informacje wskazujące na to, że lubisz samochody. Dzięki temu możemy pokazywać Ci reklamy dotyczące samochodów.
Jak zarządzać dopasowaniem reklam?
Dopasowaniem reklam możesz zarządzać w ustawieniach
prywatności konta
w sekcji „Spersonalizowane reklamy".
Dopasowaniem reklam możesz też zarządzać za pomocą linków w opisach odcinków wybranych podcastów, gdy dostawca treści czerpie zyski z treści reklamowych emitowanych w trakcie audycji, aby sfinansować tworzenie podcastu. Dostawca usługi hostingu, którym może nie być Spotify, zarządza tymi ustawieniami podcastu.
Jeśli wyłączysz spersonalizowane reklamy w sekcji
Prywatność konta
, reklamy nadal będą emitowane zarówno w bezpłatnej, jak i płatnej Wersji Usługi (np. reklamy w podcastach). Dobór tych reklam jest oparty na informacjach podanych w trakcie rejestracji oraz treściach odtwarzanych w naszych usługach. Jeśli na przykład słuchasz podcastu kulinarnego, możesz usłyszeć reklamę robota kuchennego.
Odpowiedni wiek użytkownika w kontekście dopasowanych reklam:
Odpowiedni wiek użytkownika, na którego są kierowane reklamy dopasowane, zależy od kraju, w którym się znajduje, a także zasad, jakie w nim obowiązują. Osoby, które nie osiągnęły odpowiedniego wieku, nie zobaczą dopasowanych reklam.
Osoby, które nie osiągnęły odpowiedniego wieku, nie mogą wyrazić zgody na dopasowane reklamy.
Zaczniemy wyświetlać spersonalizowane reklamy, gdy osiągniesz wiek uznawany za odpowiedni w Twoim kraju. Otrzymasz w tej sprawie powiadomienie od Usługi Spotify. Wiadomość będzie zawierała link do sekcji
Prywatność konta
, w której możesz zmienić swoje preferencje lub wyłączyć spersonalizowane reklamy w każdej chwili.

W takiej sytuacji możemy przekazać Twoje dane osobowe niniejszemu nabywcy lub jego spółce stowarzyszonej w ramach zawartej transakcji.
6. Przechowywanie danych
Przechowujemy Twoje dane osobowe tylko tak długo, jak jest to konieczne do świadczenia Usługi Spotify lub ze względu na prawnie uzasadniony interes oraz przyczyny biznesowe Spotify, takie jak:
utrzymanie wydajności Usługi Spotify,
podejmowanie decyzji biznesowych na temat nowych funkcji oraz ofert na podstawie danych,
przestrzeganie zobowiązań prawnych,
rozstrzyganie sporów.
Wybrane kategorie okresów przechowywania danych oraz kryteria, którymi się kierujemy w celu ich określania:
Dane przechowywane do momentu usunięcia ich przez Ciebie
Masz prawo żądania usunięcia przez nas niektórych Twoich danych osobowych. Więcej informacji o usuwaniu danych oraz okoliczności, w których spełniamy to żądanie, można znaleźć w części „Usuwanie danych" w
Sekcji 2. „Twoje prawa związane z danymi osobowymi oraz ustawienia"
.
Możesz również usunąć niektóre dane osobowe bezpośrednio w Usłudze Spotify, np. poprzez zamianę lub usunięcie swojego zdjęcia profilowego. Gdy użytkownicy mogą samodzielnie sprawdzać i aktualizować swoje dane osobowe, przechowujemy informacje tak długo, jak sobie tego życzą, chyba że ma zastosowanie jeden z celów ograniczonych opisanych poniżej.
Dane wygasające po określonym czasie
Ustaliliśmy pewne okresy przechowywania, aby niektóre dane wygasły po upływie określonego czasu. Są to na przykład dane osobowe wprowadzone w pole wyszukiwania, które są zazwyczaj usuwane po upływie 90 dni.
Dane przechowywane do momentu usunięcia konta Spotify
Niektóre dane przechowujemy do momentu usunięcia Twojego konta Spotify, np. nazwę użytkownika oraz informacje na profilu. Zazwyczaj przechowujemy historię odtwarzania przez cały okres funkcjonowania konta, na przykład aby przygotować retrospektywne playlisty, które cieszą się popularnością wśród naszych użytkowników, a także spersonalizowane rekomendacje dobierane na podstawie aktywności odtwarzania (np. „Twoja kapsuła czasu" oraz „Letnie wspomnienia muzyczne"). Gdy Twoje konto Spotify zostaje usunięte, Twoje dane zostają usunięte lub pozbawione elementów pozwalających na zidentyfikowanie Twojej tożsamości.
Dane przechowywane przez dłuższy okres w ograniczonych celach
Po usunięciu Twojego konta przechowujemy niektóre dane przez dłuższy czas, ale w bardzo ograniczonych celach. Mogą one wynikać między innymi ze zobowiązań prawnych lub umownych, na przykład przepisów dotyczących przechowywania danych, rozporządzeń rządowych nakładających obowiązek zachowania danych istotnych dla dochodzenia oraz dane zachowane na potrzeby postępowania sądowego. Możemy również przechowywać przez ograniczony czas dane usunięte z Usługi Spotify w następujących przykładowych celach:
zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa użytkowników,
ochrona przed szkodliwymi treściami na naszej platformie.
Pomagają nam one w analizie potencjalnych naruszeń naszych
Wytycznych dla użytkowników Spotify
oraz naszej
Polityki treści Spotify
. Usuwamy natomiast treści niezgodne z prawem, jeśli wymagają tego od nas obowiązujące przepisy.
7. Przekazywanie danych do innych krajów
Spotify udostępnia dane osobowe na całym świecie spółkom należącym do Grupy Spotify, podwykonawcom oraz partnerom z uwagi na międzynarodowy charakter prowadzonej działalności. Zakres udostępnianych danych został określony w niniejszej Polityce. Podmioty te mogą przetwarzać Twoje dane w krajach, w których przepisy o ochronie danych nie są tak restrykcyjne, jak przepisy prawa Unii Europejskiej, które mogą obowiązywać w Twoim miejscu zamieszkania. Zgodnie z tym prawem możesz na przykład nie mieć takich samych praw do swoich danych.
Za każdym razem, gdy przekazujemy dane osobowe za granicę, używamy narzędzi, aby:
mieć pewność, że przekazanie danych jest zgodne z obowiązującym prawem,
zapewnić bezpieczeństwo Twoim danym na podobnym poziomie jak w Unii Europejskiej.
Stosujemy następujące mechanizmy prawne, aby mieć pewność, że przekazanie danych odbywa się zgodne z obowiązującym prawem Unii Europejskiej:
Standardowe klauzule umowne
(„
SKU
"). Klauzule te nakładają na drugą stronę obowiązek ochrony Twoich danych oraz zapewniają Ci prawa oraz ochronę na poziomie UE. Korzystamy z SKU na przykład do przekazywania danych osobowych opisanych w
Sekcji 3 „Dane osobowe gromadzone przez Spotify"
naszym dostawcom usług hostingowych, którzy korzystają z serwerów na terenie Stanów Zjednoczonych. Możesz korzystać ze swoich praw wynikających ze standardowych klauzul umownych. Aby to zrobić,
skontaktuj się z nami
lub stroną trzecią, która przetwarza Twoje dane osobowe.
Decyzje o adekwatności
. Oznacza to, że przekazujemy dane osobowe do krajów spoza Europejskiego Obszaru Gospodarczego, w których obowiązują odpowiednie przepisy o ochronie danych osobowych określone przez Komisję Europejską. Na przykład przekazujemy dane osobowe opisane w
Sekcji 3. „Dane osobowe gromadzone przez Spotify"
dostawcom z siedzibami w Zjednoczonym Królestwie, Kanadzie, Japonii, Republice Korei oraz Szwajcarii.
Identyfikujemy i stosujemy również dodatkowe zabezpieczenia, odpowiednio dla każdego transferu danych. Stosujemy na przykład:
zabezpieczenia techniczne, takie jak szyfrowanie i pseudonimizacja;
politykę oraz procesy mające na celu kwestionowanie nieproporcjonalnych lub niezgodnych z prawem wniosków organów władzy.
8. Ochrona danych osobowych
Dokładamy wszelkich starań, aby odpowiednio zabezpieczyć dane osobowe naszych użytkowników. Wdrażamy odpowiednie środki techniczne oraz organizacyjne mające na celu zwiększenie bezpieczeństwa Twoich danych osobowych. Należy jednak pamiętać, że żaden system nie jest całkowicie bezpieczny.
Wdrożyliśmy wiele rozwiązań, aby zapobiegać nieautoryzowanemu dostępowi do danych oraz ich niepotrzebnemu przechowywaniu w naszych systemach. Obejmują one politykę w zakresie pseudonimizacji, szyfrowania, dostępu oraz przechowywania danych.
Jeśli chcesz zabezpieczyć swoje konto, zachęcamy Cię do:
używania silnego hasła, które jest powiązane
tylko
z kontem Spotify;
nieudostępniania nikomu swojego hasła;
ograniczenia dostępu do swojego komputera oraz przeglądarki;
wylogowania się po zakończeniu korzystania z Usługi Spotify na wspólnym urządzeniu;
zapoznania się ze szczegółowymi informacjami o
ochronie konta
.
Możesz wylogować się ze Spotify w wielu miejscach jednocześnie za pomocą funkcji „Wyloguj się wszędzie" na stronie
konta
.
Jeśli inne osoby mają dostęp do Twojego konta Spotify, mogą uzyskać dostęp do danych osobowych, ustawień oraz Usługi Spotify na Twoim koncie. Na przykład w przypadku zezwolenia innej osobie na korzystanie z Twojego konta na wspólnym urządzeniu.
Twoim obowiązkiem jest pozwalanie osobom uprawnionym do korzystania z Twojego konta tylko wtedy, gdy nie masz nic przeciwko udostępnieniu im swoich danych osobowych. Korzystanie z konta Spotify przez inne osoby może mieć wpływ na Twoje spersonalizowane rekomendacje i pobieranie danych.

10. Zmiany niniejszej Polityki
Możemy co jakiś czas wprowadzać zmiany w niniejszej Polityce.
W przypadku wprowadzenia istotnych zmian do niniejszej Polityki powiadomimy Cię o nich w sposób wyraźny i dostosowany do okoliczności. Możemy wyświetlić na przykład widoczne powiadomienie w Usłudze Spotify, przesłać wiadomość e-mail lub powiadomienie na urządzeniu.

Cloudflare and GDPR compliance
Cloudflare is a privacy-first company. As such, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) represents many steps we were already taking. We do not sell personal data we process, or use it for any purpose other than delivering our services. In addition, we let people access, correct, and delete their personal information, and give our customers control over the information passing through our network.
To learn more, explore our GDPR FAQ below, or check out Cloudflare’s overall privacy policy.

Privacy policy
Frequently asked questions (Last Updated: Oct 13, 2023)
What personal data does Cloudflare process for its customers and where?
Cloudflare is a security, performance, and reliability company headquartered in the United States with global operations including five offices in Europe that delivers a broad range of network services to businesses of all sizes and in all geographies. We help make our customers’ websites and Internet applications more secure, enhance the performance of their business-critical applications, and eliminate the cost and complexity of managing individual network hardware. Cloudflare's Global Network  – which is powered by Edge servers in more than 300 cities around the world, as described
here
– serves as the foundation on which we can rapidly develop and deploy our products for our customers.
The types of personal data Cloudflare processes on behalf of a customer depend on which Cloudflare services are implemented. For our most popular Core Application Layer Services, Cloudflare does not store customer content, nor do we have any control of the data our customers choose to transmit, route, switch, and cache through our Global Network. In a limited number of cases, Cloudflare products can be used for storage of content. Regardless of what Cloudflare services they use, however, our customers are fully responsible for their own compliance with applicable law and their independent contractual arrangements in connection with the data they choose to transmit, route, switch, cache, or store through the Cloudflare Global Network.
For our Core Application Layer Services, the vast majority of data that transits Cloudflare’s network stays on Cloudflare’s Edge servers. Metadata about this activity is processed on behalf of our customers in our data centers in the United States and Europe.
Cloudflare maintains log data about events on our network. Some of this log data will include information about visitors to and/or authorized users of a customer’s domains, networks, websites, application programming interfaces (“APIs”), or applications, including the Cloudflare product Cloudflare Zero Trust as may be applicable. This metadata contains extremely limited personal data, most often in the form of IP addresses. We process this type of information on behalf of our customers in our data centers in the U.S. and Europe for a limited period of time.
What specific technical and organizational security measures does Cloudflare provide for personal data?
Cloudflare views security as a critical element of ensuring data privacy. Since Cloudflare launched in 2010, we’ve released a number of state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing technologies, typically ahead of the rest of the industry. Among other things, these tools allow our customers to easily encrypt the content of communications through universal SSL; encrypt or otherwise protect the metadata in communications using new protocols like DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, and Oblivious HTTP; and control where their SSL keys are held or where their traffic is inspected.
Cloudflare maintains a security program that exceeds industry standards. Our security program includes maintaining formal security policies and procedures, establishing proper logical and physical access controls, and implementing technical safeguards in corporate and production environments, including establishing secure configurations, secure transmission and connections, logging, monitoring, and having adequate encryption technologies for personal data.
We currently maintain the following validations: ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 27018,  SOC 2 Type II, and PCI DSS Level 1 compliance. We are also certified to the European Cloud Code of Conduct and Germany’s C5 2020 standard. You can learn more about our certifications and reports
here
.
To view the security measures Cloudflare offers for the protection of personal data, including personal data transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to the U.S., please see Annex 2 of our standard
DPA
.
How does Cloudflare address the requirements of Art. 44 of the GDPR regarding personal data transfers to the U.S.?
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) provides a number of legal mechanisms to ensure that appropriate safeguards, enforceable rights, and effective legal remedies are available for European data subjects whose personal data is transferred from the EEA to a third country — a country not covered by the GDPR or deemed to have adequate data protection laws in place.
Those mechanisms include:
Where the EU Commission has decided that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection after assessing that country’s rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and a number of other factors;
Where a data controller or processor has put in place binding corporate rules;
Where a data controller or processor has in place standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission; or
Where a data controller or processor has put in place an approved code of conduct or an approved certification mechanism.
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (“UK”) internationally, we rely  on the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”), including supplementary measures as necessary, or, for transfers to the United States, we have also certified our compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”), and/or the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Our standard Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) will continue to incorporate the EU SCCs to ensure we have multiple legal bases for processing data.
Is Cloudflare certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework?
Yes. When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom to the United States, we rely on our certifications under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, respectively. Should these certifications lapse or become otherwise invalidated, Cloudflare relies on the EU standard contractual clauses, including supplementary measures as necessary for transfers to the United States. We also use the standard contractual clauses for other international transfers from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.
What safeguards apply to my data under the Data Privacy Frameworks?
In October 2022, U.S. President Biden signed Executive Order 14086 (“EO14086”), which introduced new safeguards for U.S. signals intelligence activities in order to make the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework possible. Based on the protections afforded by EO14086, the European Commission made an adequacy finding for the EU-U.S. DPF. Importantly, these protections apply equally to all transfers – those made pursuant to one of the DPFs or those made under the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (see the
EDPB’s “Information note on data transfers under the GDPR to the United States after the adoption of the adequacy decision on 10 July 2023
”).
The protections introduced by EO14086 include safeguards to ensure that privacy and civil liberties are integral considerations such that (i) signals intelligence activities shall be conducted only where “necessary” to advance a validated intelligence priority, and (ii) be conducted only to the extent and in a manner that is “proportionate” to the validated intelligence priority. EO14086 also provides a multi-layer redress mechanism for individuals to obtain independent and binding review and redress of claims that their personal information collected through U.S. signals intelligence was processed in a way that violates their privacy rights.
What additional data protection safeguards does Cloudflare provide?
Because we believe earning and maintaining customer trust is essential, Cloudflare has had data protection safeguards in place since well before the “Schrems II”
case (Case C-311/18, Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems), including many of the additional safeguards recommended by the EDPB in its post-
Schrems II
guidance (Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data adopted on 18 June 2021).
Cloudflare has a strong commitment to transparency and accountability regarding processing of personal data as described above, and our DPA makes many of these commitments contractually binding. When we issued our very first transparency report in 2014 for legal process received in 2013, we pledged that we would require legal process before providing any government entity with any customer data outside of an emergency and that we would provide our customers with notice of any legal process requesting their customer or billing information before disclosure of that information unless legally prohibited. We publicly stated that we have never turned over encryption keys to any government, provided any government a feed of content transiting our network, or deployed law enforcement equipment on our network. We also committed that if we were asked to do any of those things, we would “exhaust all legal remedies in order to protect our customers from what we believe are illegal or unconstitutional requests.” Since those days early in Cloudflare’s history, we have restated those commitments twice a year, and even expanded on them, in our
Transparency Reports
.
We have also demonstrated our belief in transparency and our commitment to protecting our customers by filing litigation when necessary. In 2013, with the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we legally challenged an administratively issued U.S. national security letter (“NSL”) to protect our customer’s rights because of provisions that allowed the government to restrict us from disclosing information about the NSL to the affected customer. Cloudflare provided no customer information in response to that request, but the non-disclosure provisions remained in effect until a court lifted the restrictions in 2016.
We have frequently stated our position that any government requests for personal data that conflict with the privacy laws of a person’s country of residence should be legally challenged. (See, for example, our
Transparency Report
and our white paper,
Cloudflare’s policies around data privacy and law enforcement requests
, on government requests for data.) The EDPB recognized that GDPR might pose such a conflict in
this assessment
. Our commitment to GDPR compliance means that Cloudflare would pursue legal remedies before producing data identified as being subject to GDPR in response to a U.S. government request for data. Consistent with existing U.S. case law and statutory frameworks, Cloudflare may ask U.S. courts to quash a request from U.S. authorities for personal data based on such a conflict of law.
Our standard data processing addendum (“DPA”) for our customers incorporates the above-described supplementary measures and safeguards as contractual commitments. You can view these contractual commitments in section 7 of our
DPA
. Last but not least, we have in place robust security measures and encryption protocols, which can be viewed in Annex 2 of our DPA.
We will continue to apply these supplementary measures and safeguards in addition to the additional safeguards afforded under EO14086.
As always, we are continuing to monitor ongoing developments in this space and will ensure our ongoing compliance with the EU GDPR Articles 44 and 46. During this time, we will continue to follow our commitments under existing DPAs, and our commitments under the current SCCs, and our commitments under our certification to the Data Privacy Frameworks certification.
Does the U.S. Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (“CLOUD”) Act affect how Cloudflare views its obligation to turn over data in response to U.S. government legal process?
We believe that U.S. government requests for the personal data of a non-U.S. person that conflict with the privacy laws of that person’s country of residence (such as the GDPR in the EU) should be legally challenged.
The CLOUD Act does not expand U.S. investigative authority. Tough requirements for law enforcement to obtain a valid warrant remain unchanged. The CLOUD Act also applies to access to content, which we generally do not store, as described above. Furthermore, the CLOUD Act does not change existing practices when U.S. law enforcement seeks access to corporate data. It is important to note that law enforcement would typically seek to obtain data from the entity which has effective control of the data (i.e., our customers) rather than cloud providers. In the event law enforcement requests such data from Cloudflare, we would encourage them to request the data from our customer instead of us.
Do the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) Section 702 and Executive Order 12333 discussed in the Schrems II decision affect Cloudflare?
We think it will be helpful to provide additional explanation of the U.S. national security authorities referenced by the CJEU in its analysis in the “Schrems II”
decision (Case C-311/18, Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems).
Section 702.
Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) is an authority that allows the U.S. government to request the communications of non-U.S. persons located outside of the United States for foreign intelligence purposes. The U.S. government uses section 702 to collect the content of communications through specifical “selectors”, such as email addresses, that are associated with specific foreign intelligence targets. Because the authority is typically used to collect the content of communications, the “electronic communications service providers” asked to comply with section 702 are typically email providers or other providers with access to the content of communications.
As noted in our transparency report, Cloudflare does not have access to this type of traditional customer content for Cloudflare’s core services. In addition, Cloudflare has had a
public commitment for many years
that we have never provided any government a feed of our customers' content transiting our network and that we would exhaust all legal remedies if we were asked to do so in order to protect our customers from what we believe are illegal or unconstitutional requests.
Executive Order 12333.
Executive Order 12333 governs U.S. intelligence agencies' foreign intelligence collection targeting non-U.S. persons outside the United States. Executive Order 12333 does not have provisions to compel the assistance of U.S. companies.
Cloudflare has a longstanding commitment to require legal process before providing any government entity with access to any customer data outside of an emergency. We therefore would not comply with voluntary requests for data under Executive Order 12333. In addition, Cloudflare has been a leader in encouraging additional security for data in transit, for both content and metadata, to prevent personal data from any type of prying eyes. In 2014, for example, we launched
Universal SSL
, making encryption — something that had been expensive and difficult — free for all Cloudflare customers. The week we launched it, we doubled the size of the encrypted web. Because of an increasing number of laws attempting to target encryption, we have even
committed
that we have never weakened, compromised, or subverted any of our encryption at the request of a government or other third party.
How can Customers on Self-Service Agreements make sure the proper cross-border data transfer mechanisms are in place with Cloudflare?
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“UK”) internationally, we rely on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”), including supplementary measures as necessary, or, for transfers to the United States, we have also certified our compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. These representations are contained in our
standard DPA
, which is incorporated by reference into our
Self-Serve Subscription Agreement
. To the extent the personal data transfer requires the SCCs, then our DPA incorporates the SCCs for this data. Therefore, no action is required to ensure that the appropriate cross-border data transfer mechanisms are in place.
How can Enterprise Customers make sure the proper cross-border data transfer mechanisms are in place with Cloudflare?
When Cloudflare transfers personal data from the EEA, Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“UK”) internationally, we rely on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”), including supplementary measures as necessary, or, for transfers to the United States, we have also certified our compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. These representations are contained in our
standard DPA
, which is incorporated into our standard
Enterprise Subscription Agreement
(“ESA”). Therefore, no action is required to ensure that the appropriate cross-border data transfer mechanisms are in place.
Enterprise customers are subject to our standard ESA if they entered into the ESA with Cloudflare on or after August 8, 2019 and do not have a custom agreement. Enterprise customers on older versions of our ESA or on custom ESAs or custom DPAs may not have the cross-border data transfer mechanism documented. These customers or any other Enterprise customers with questions about their DPA may contact their Customer Success Manager.
What tools does Cloudflare have for its customers to geographically restrict access to data?
We recognize that some of our customers would prefer that any personal data subject to the GDPR (or its UK or Swiss equivalents) remain in the EU and not be transferred to the U.S. for processing. To that end, we introduced the Cloudflare Data Localization Suite, which helps businesses get the performance and security benefits of Cloudflare’s global network, while making it easy to set rules and controls at the edge about where their data is stored and protected.
The Data Localization Suite bundles some existing offerings with some new features:
a) Regional Services. Cloudflare has data centers in over 300 cities across 100+ countries. Regional Services together with our Geo Key Manager solution allows Customers to pick the data center locations where TLS keys are stored and TLS termination takes place. Traffic is ingested globally, applying L3/L4 DDoS mitigations, while security, performance, and reliability functions (such as, WAF, CDN, DDoS mitigation, etc.) are serviced at designated Cloudflare data centers only.
b) Metadata Boundary. The Customer Metadata Boundary ensures that the end user traffic metadata that can identify a customer stays in the European Union. This includes all the logs and analytics that a customer can see. This is done by ensuring that the end user metadata that can identify a customer flows through a single service at our edge, before being forwarded to one of our core data centers. When the Metadata Boundary is enabled for a customer, our Edge ensures that any log message that identifies that customer (that is, contains that customer's Account ID) is not sent outside the EU. It will only be sent to our core data center in the EU.
c
) Geo key Manager. Cloudflare has a truly international customer base and we’ve learned that customers around the world have different regulatory and statutory requirements, and different risk profiles, concerning the placement of their private keys. With that philosophy in mind, we set out to design a very flexible system for deciding where keys can be kept. Geo Key Manager lets customers limit the exposure of their private keys to certain locations. It’s similar to Keyless SSL, but instead of having to run a key server inside your infrastructure, Cloudflare hosts key servers in the locations of your choosing.
In addition, Cloudflare offers Keyless SSL, which allows a customer to store and manage their own SSL Private keys for use with Cloudflare. Customers can use a variety of systems for their keystore, including hardware security modules (“HSMs”), virtual servers, and hardware running Unix/Linux and Windows that is housed in environments customers control.
Are there any enforceable rights and effective remedies available to EU data subjects in the U.S. where data is processed by Cloudflare or Cloudflare’s sub-processors?
As outlined in our
Transparency Report
, Cloudflare requires valid legal process before providing the personal information of our customers to government entities or civil litigants. Except in the case of an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person, we do not provide our customers' personal information to government officials in response to requests that do not include legal process.
To ensure that our customers have the opportunity to enforce their rights, it is Cloudflare’s policy to notify our customers of a subpoena or other legal process requesting their information before disclosure of that information, whether the legal process comes from the government or private parties involved in civil litigation, unless legally prohibited. Specifically, our
DPA
commits that unless legally prohibited, we will notify Customers if we are able to identify that third-party legal process requesting personal data we process on behalf of that Customer raises a conflict of law — such as where the personal data is governed by the GDPR. Customers notified of a pending legal request for their personal data can seek to intervene to prevent the disclosure of personal data.
In addition, U.S. law provides mechanisms for companies to challenge orders that pose potential conflicts of law, such as a legal request for data subject to GDPR. The CLOUD Act, for example, provides mechanisms for a provider to petition a court to quash or modify a legal request that poses such a conflict of law. That process also allows a provider to disclose the existence of the request to a foreign government whose citizen is affected, if that government has signed a CLOUD Act agreement with the United States. Cloudflare has committed to legally challenge any orders that pose such a conflict of law. To date, we have received no orders that we have identified as posing such a conflict.
In October 2022 U.S. President Biden signed
Executive Order 14086
, which introduced new safeguards for U.S. signals intelligence activities in order to make possible the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Among these safeguards is the creation of a redress mechanism for individuals who claim their personal data has been collected unlawfully through signals intelligence programs. Individuals can file a complaint with the U.S. Civil Liberties Protection Officer (“CPLO”), who can investigate these complaints and issue binding decisions against intelligence agencies. The CPLO’s decisions can be appealed to a newly created  Data Protection Review Court (“DPRC”).
Finally, in compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (together, “the DPFs”), and the Swiss-U.S. DPF (together, the “DPFs”), Cloudflare commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please see Section 7 of our
Privacy Policy
.
How is Cloudflare dealing with cross-border transfers to and from the UK?
We have been paying close attention to the changes the UK is making in the data protection area since it left the European Union. Currently, the EU GDPR has been saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the United Kingdom's European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the "UK GDPR"). Pursuant to the International Data Transfer Addendum (Version B1.0) issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office under s.119(A) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK Addendum”), Cloudflare may transfer UK personal data outside the UK in reliance on the EU SCCs mechanism coupled with the UK Addendum. Depending on our agreements with our customers, Cloudflare relies on the EU SCCs mechanism coupled with the UK Addendum, plus supplementary measures, or Cloudflare will rely on the UK extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework once it is approved.
