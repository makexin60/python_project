cellular call and text activity
The call and text activity available through Verizon Family includes only the date, time and duration of calls and texts made using Verizon Wireless cellular calling and text messaging services.  It does not include calls or messaging done via third-party mobile applications such as Apple iMessage, Apple FaceTime, Google Messages, Google Voice, or Whatsapp, or via social media services such as Facebook Messenger or Instagram Direct Messages.
Verizon Family’s privacy practices are covered by Verizon’s Privacy Policy as well as the practices described here. In the event of a conflict between the two policies, the practices described in this policy govern when using Verizon Family services.

Information we collect and how it is used.
Information we collect from Guardians and Members.
When Guardians and Members download the Verizon Family app, we may collect information from their device, including device identifiers, IP address, device type, app version, and application and feature usage. If Guardians or Members allow it, Verizon Family will collect location (from the mobile device and, if they have a Verizon Wireless mobile line, from the wireless network) and motion activity information (for example, if they’re walking, running, biking, or in a vehicle). If permitted, we will also access their device’s contact list to enhance the call and text activity information provided about Dependents.
If they turn on driving activity monitoring for their device, Verizon Family will also use motion activity, location, and device usage data to determine driving insights and behaviors, such as trip route and distance, top speed, braking, accelerating, cornering, potential crash events, and device usage while in a moving vehicle, and use this information to calculate individual trip driving scores and an overall driving score.
Guardians and Members can also provide emergency contacts for themselves and Guardians can for their Dependents. These emergency contacts will receive a text message with the user’s real time device location if the user initiates a Safe Walk session or an SOS alert during a Safe Walk session. Guardians can also enable Roadside Assistance for themselves and their Dependents and, in the event they request service, their name, phone number, car details, the requested service, and the address they provide for service, will be shared with our Roadside Assistance provider, Signature Motor Club.
When Guardians add a Dependent to their Verizon Family account, we may collect the Dependent’s name and photo, phone number and other device information, date of birth, trusted contacts and emergency contacts. We also collect information about the features Guardians want to use on the Dependent’s device, including time and usage restrictions, content filters, whether the Dependent is a passenger or driver (for driving insights), and whether Roadside Assistance is enabled. When a Guardian invites other Guardians and Members to join the Verizon Family account, we collect their names and phone numbers.
Information we collect from devices designated as Dependents (including children under 13).
For devices connected to the Verizon network, we collect the Dependent’s location from the wireless network; data usage and cellular call and text activity; and mobile device info, such as phone number and device identifiers.
When the Verizon Family Companion app is downloaded on a Dependent’s device, we may also collect additional information from the device, including other device identifiers, IP address, device type, app version, and application and feature usage. If permitted, Verizon Family will also collect GPS location, contacts stored on the device, and motion activity. When the Verizon Family Virtual Private Network (VPN) is set up on the device for content filtering and web and app monitoring, we collect information about the websites visited and apps launched on the device. We also collect a PIN from the Dependent which they can use to cancel an SOS alert during a Safe Walk session.
When driving insights are enabled on a Dependent’s device, we collect motion and location data to determine driving insights and behaviors from the Dependent’s device, such as trip route and distance, top speed, braking, accelerating, cornering, and potential crash events, and will use this information to calculate individual trip driving scores. Unless the Dependent is designated as a passenger by the Guardian, we will also collect device usage while in a moving vehicle, and use the driving data and device usage data to calculate an overall driving score.
When Roadside Assistance is enabled for a Dependent and they request service,  we will collect their name, phone number, car details, the requested service, and the service address.
For mobile devices connected to the Verizon network, including Dependent lines, we collect an E-911 address for emergency response.
Verizon Family does not collect more information from Dependents’ devices than is necessary to render Verizon Family services. Verizon Family does not enable users of Dependent devices to make their personal information publicly available.
How we use information collected.
Verizon Family uses the information we collect to deliver, maintain and support Verizon Family services and for analytics. We may use mobile device information collected from a Guardian or Member’s device, including device identifiers, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for Verizon Family services that you may have seen and in accordance with the Verizon Privacy Policy.
Location and other information we collect concerning Dependent devices may be considered sensitive personal information under some state laws.
Information we share about Dependents.
We disclose your Dependent’s personal information to others on your Verizon Family account and to service providers who work on our behalf. These
service providers
2
may use personal information disclosed to them only to provide Verizon Family services and analytics, and are required to delete the information when it is no longer needed to provide the service. We do not sell information we collect from Dependents as part of this service or information from or about Dependents’ devices or share it for any other purpose, including targeted advertising.

Service Providers
For Dependents, we share information with Here Technologies and Mapbox for mapping and location services.  We also share device identifiers with Google Analytics for app analytics services so that Verizon Family can optimize app performance and with PubNub to deliver alerts that parents set about their Dependents’ location or activity. If the Verizon Family VPN is enabled, the Dependent’s online activity is shared with Cloudflare for content filtering and web and app activity monitoring. Location, motion data, and information about phone usage while driving is shared with Verizon Family’s telematics provider, Cambridge Mobile Telematics, for driving scores and the driving analytics that are visible in the Verizon Family app. If the Guardian has enabled Roadside Assistance and service is requested, information needed to respond to the request, including the Dependent’s name, phone number, type of service requested, car details, and service address, is shared with our Roadside Assistance provider, Signature Motor Club.
Choices and controls.
For Guardians and Members.
Guardians and Members are asked to consent to the collection of certain information from their devices, including location, motion activity data, and device contacts. They may choose not to share their device location or may choose to share it with other Guardians on the Verizon Family account or with everyone on the Verizon Family account (including Dependents, Members and Guardians). They can update their location sharing choices and turn driving activity monitoring off in the settings menu of the Verizon Family app. If they turn off their location permission in their device settings but do not update their location sharing permission in their Verizon Family in-app settings, Verizon Family will continue to collect their device’s location from the Verizon wireless network, if available. They can also update their motion activity data and device contacts permissions in their device settings.
For Dependents.
When Guardians set up Verizon Family, they are asked to provide consent for Verizon Family to collect personal information from Dependent devices, including for location; motion activity data; call and text activity and data usage; mobile telephone number; device identifiers, device type, app version, and IP address; child name and photo; date of birth; device contacts; websites and apps accessed; driving activity such as trip details, potential crash events and phone usage; and when Roadside Assistance is enabled, certain additional information is collected and shared when service is requested. When Dependents download the Verizon Family Companion app, they are also asked to consent to the collection of certain information, including location, motion activity data, device contacts, and installation of a VPN to monitor web and app activity. Permission can be revoked for the collection of all personal information from a Dependent by removing the Verizon Family Dependent profile in the Guardian’s Verizon Family app. We will continue to collect information to provide wireless service to the line.
When Dependents download the Verizon Family Companion app, they are also asked to consent to the collection of certain information, including location, motion activity data, device contacts, and installation of a VPN to monitor web and app activity. Dependents using Android devices on a Verizon Family plan that includes certain parental controls will also be asked to enable Accessibility settings for the Verizon Family Companion app, which will prevent Dependents from deleting the Companion app or turning off the VPN without obtaining a PIN from their Guardian. The PIN can be found in the settings menu of their Guardian’s Verizon Family app. Permission can be revoked for the collection of all personal information from a Dependent by removing the Verizon Family Dependent profile in the Guardian’s Verizon Family app. We will continue to collect information to provide wireless service to the line.
If the Verizon Family Companion app is removed from a Dependent’s device, precise location, real-time motion activity, screen time monitoring and web, app and driving activity monitoring services will not be collected by Verizon Family and therefore will not be available within Verizon Family for those Dependent devices. Precise location collection can be turned off in the Dependent’s device settings. If a Dependent’s location sharing permission is changed in their device settings or if the Verizon Family Companion app is uninstalled, device location from the wireless network will continue to be collected and shared in Verizon Family. To stop all location sharing in Verizon Family, the Guardian must remove the Verizon Family Dependent profile.
Dependents can update other permissions in their device settings, such as for motion activity data collection, contact list collection, and the VPN (which allows certain web and app activity monitoring). When the Verizon Family VPN is uninstalled from the Dependent’s device, Verizon Family web browsing and app activity monitoring services are disabled, but screen time information may still be collected if the Dependent device uses an Android operating system and the Android device settings permit it. Dependents with an Android device who have enabled Accessibility settings for the Companion app will be unable to uninstall the Companion app or the VPN without obtaining a PIN from their Guardian. Dependents can also turn off driving insights in the Verizon Family Companion app settings and Guardians can disable Roadside Assistance in the Verizon Family app settings.
Guardians may review the personal information collected by Verizon Family from Dependent devices. For more information or assistance with these choices or if you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, you can contact us at

Verizon Family Privacy Policy for Kids
What is Verizon Family?
Verizon Family (previously called Smart Family) lets parents (known in the app as Guardians) and other trusted adults (known as Members) keep an eye on kids' phones and tablets. It helps families find each other's devices, and depending on your Guardians’ plan, may include tools that let your Guardians and others they allow set screen time and usage limits, approve contacts, block certain websites and apps, pause the internet, see who and when you call and text over the Verizon network and what websites you visit and apps you use, and monitor your driving activity. Verizon Family also has Safe Walk, which lets you quickly send your device location to your emergency contacts. Your Guardian can also turn on Roadside Assistance so that you can get help if you have a problem with a car you are in, like a flat tire or a dead battery.
What information do we collect about you?
When a Guardian adds you to a Verizon Family account, we may collect from them your name, photo, birthday, trusted and emergency contacts, and info about the Verizon Family features they want to use, like whether they want to block certain websites or apps, and if you are a driver or passenger (if you have turned on driving insights monitoring). If your phone or tablet is connected to the Verizon network, we collect your device location using our wireless network, information about who and when you are calling and texting over the Verizon wireless network, how much data you are using, and information about your phone or tablet, like its phone number and certain device identifiers.
If you download the Verizon Family companion app and give us permission, we may also collect your device’s precise location using GPS, online activity, the contacts saved on your phone or tablet, and motion activity that shows if you are walking, running, biking, or riding in a car. We also collect other information about your device, like the device type, the version of the Verizon Family app you are using, the features you use in the app, and other device identifiers and IP address. This information is used to provide the services requested by your Guardian.
We will also collect a PIN from you which you can use to cancel an SOS alert that you may activate during a Safe Walk session. If you enable driving insights, we will collect information about where you are and other information like your trip route and distance; how fast the vehicle traveled; how the vehicle braked, accelerated, and cornered; and potential crashes. This information is used to create a driving score for each trip you take. If your Guardian says you are a driver, we will also collect info about whether you are using your phone when the car is moving and use that to help calculate your overall driving score.
If your Guardian has turned on Roadside Assistance, and you request help, we will collect your name, phone number, info about your car, the address where you are asking for help, and the service you need so that our Roadside Assistance provider can help you.
If your phone or tablet is connected to the Verizon network, we will also collect an E-911 address to help with emergency response in case you need help.
How does Verizon Family use this information?
Verizon Family only collects from you the information we need to make Verizon Family work and to improve it. We never sell kids’ information or use it to show them ads.
Who does Verizon Family share this information with?
Verizon Family shares  information about you with other people on the Verizon Family account and with
companies that help us provide Verizon Family
1
. These companies can only use your information to provide and help us improve Verizon Family and they must delete your information when they no longer need it to provide the service. We don't share information we collect through Verizon Family for any other purpose.

Companies That Help Us Provide Verizon Family
We share information about you, including where you are, with companies called Here Technologies and Mapbox so they can show where you are on a map in the Verizon Family apps.  We also share certain identifiers from your phone or tablet with Google Analytics so it can help us see how our apps are working and with PubNub to deliver alerts that Guardians set about your location or activity. Information about your online activity on your phone or tablet may also be shared with a company called Cloudflare if a VPN is turned on to monitor the websites you visit and the apps you use or block you from visiting certain websites or apps. And if driving activity monitoring is turned on, we share your location, motion data, and information about phone usage while driving with a company called Cambridge Mobile Telematics who provides driving scores. If your Guardian enables Roadside Assistance and you request help, we will share your name, phone number, info about your car, the address where you are asking for help, and the service you need with our Roadside Assistance provider, Signature Motor Club.
What control do I have over the information you have about me?
When your Guardian adds you to their Verizon Family account, they have to agree to let us collect some information about you. They can also invite you to download the Verizon Family Companion app. If you download the app, you’ll be asked to let Verizon Family collect some information about you, like your location, how you’re moving (like walking, biking, running, or in a vehicle), and the contacts on your phone or tablet. You’ll also be asked to allow Verizon Family to install a VPN, which lets your Guardians and others they allow see what websites and apps you’re using, block certain ones, and even pause the internet.
You can turn off some permissions, like the VPN and the sharing of your motion activity or your contacts, in your phone or tablet’s settings. If you uninstall the VPN, some features that let your Guardians and others they allow see your web and app activity may be turned off. But, if you use an Android, your screen time info might still be collected depending on your settings. You can also change your location permission in your device settings, but Verizon Family will still get your estimated location from the wireless network if you have a Verizon device. You can turn off driving insights monitoring in your Verizon Family app’s settings.
If you are using an Android phone or tablet, and depending on your Guardians’ Verizon Family plan, you may be asked to turn on Accessibility settings for your Verizon Family Companion app. If you turn on Accessibility settings, you won’t be able to delete the Verizon Family Companion app or turn off the VPN without first asking your Guardian for a PIN.
If you delete the Verizon Family Companion app, Verizon Family will stop collecting your GPS location, how you’re moving, online activity, and driving info. But Verizon Family will still get your estimated location from the Verizon wireless network.
To stop all information sharing by Verizon Family, your Guardian needs to remove your profile from their Verizon Family app. Verizon will continue to collect information to provide wireless service to your device.
How long does Verizon Family keep the information it collects about me?
We only keep the information for as long as we need it to provide the Verizon Family service to you. When your Guardians don’t want to use Verizon Family any longer and unsubscribe from Verizon Family, or delete your profile from their account, Verizon Family deletes the information we have about you.
Do I have specific rights under any state privacy laws?
Some states give you the right to see what data we have about you and ask to have it deleted or corrected. If you would like to see the data we have about you or ask to have it deleted or corrected, talk to your parents. They can see, delete, and make changes to some information we have about you directly in their Verizon Family app or can make a request on your behalf. You can also call (800) 333-3972 to make a request to see the data we have about you or ask to have it deleted or, if you are 13 years or older, you can make a request through our
Verizon privacy inquiries form
.
What if I want more information about how Verizon Family treats information about me?

Verizon and third-party information
This includes information about how you use your mobile device (such as web browsing, device location, app/feature use, and IP address or similar information), certain information about your Verizon products and services (such as device type and amount of use), and demographic and interest information you provide or we obtain from other companies (such as gender, age range and interests).

Business and marketing insights
Insights are observations about groups of people that can be used to better understand consumer actions. For example, we may create insights about the number of customers in different age groups who visit a website, use an app, or go to a retail store or stadium. We also can develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns about people who move from one area to another during the morning rush hour.
Our Identity Verification Service helps protect you against fraud.
We use certain Verizon Wireless account, device and profile data on behalf of companies with which you do business, for example, to help your bank confirm that you are calling rather than a fraudster, which may help protect you against theft and account takeover. Third parties that verify your identity are contractually required to protect the information and use it only for providing their verification services.

How does Verizon protect my information, and how do I update my account details?
Learn about our information security and retention practices and how to update your account information.
Information security and retention.
We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. In addition, we train our employees on the importance of privacy and security, as well as the proper ways to access, use and disclose customer information. Our practices and policies prohibit employees with whom we disclose this information from using sensitive information unless they are authorized to do so and have a business need.
Our policies require that we retain records for as long as they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records, not always by distinct data elements. For example, your name is part of your account, billing, technical support and call detail records.
Although we strive to keep information secure, we can’t guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized
attempt to access
32
, use or disclose personal information. We use our security and incident response plans to handle such incidents. You can help secure your account using
advice, tips and tools we provide
.

attempt to access
For example, we have seen unauthorized attempts to access our customers' third party accounts, including accounts that customers have with financial institutions, email service providers or social media.
If you become aware of a security issue, please visit our page to
Report Security Vulnerabilities
and follow the instructions to report your issue. We will work with you to address your concern.
Let’s work together to keep children safe.
If you see content you believe to be related to child sexual abuse, or if you see any other illegal content involving children when using a Verizon service, report it by sending an email to abuse-csam@verizon.com and include the words “child sexual abuse material” in the subject line. You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through their
CyberTipline.

You may have additional rights under the Cable Act.
Information about the Cable Act
The “Cable Act” (Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended) limits the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators and requires operators to tell you, to the extent that the Cable Act applies to the services you purchase, about the
personally identifiable information

Personally Identifiable Information
Under the Cable Act, personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person
We may use our cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render cable service or other services provided to you over the cable system and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. We may collect additional personally identifiable information with your prior consent. We may use or disclose personally identifiable information without consent where necessary to render services and to conduct legitimate business activities related to the services we provide.
We may also disclose your name and address as long as you have the ability to prevent or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, your viewing or other uses of the services we provide. We disclose name and address information to service providers as part of our Relevant TV advertising program. These providers work on our behalf to help our advertisers optimize their ads by preventing the same ads you see on Fios from being shown to you in other places. You can opt out of participating in the
Relevant TV advertising program

We may also disclose personally identifiable information if it is required by law to comply with
valid legal process

Valid Legal Process
We may disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, but we will not disclose records revealing your video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.
We retain personally identifiable information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes. If you would like to access the personally identifiable information we have about you, please submit a
privacy inquiry form
to arrange a time and convenient location to do so during business hours. If you believe any of your personally identifiable information is inaccurate, we will work with you to update our records.
If you believe that your Cable Act privacy rights have been violated, please submit a
privacy inquiry form
and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.

Illinois Biometric Information Privacy
The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act applies to
Biometric Identifiers or Biometric Information
58
.
Close
×
58.
Biometric Identifiers or Biometric Information
Biometric Identifiers means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of your hand or face geometry. Biometric Identifiers do not include writing samples, written signatures, photographs, demographic data, tattoo descriptions or physical descriptions such as height or weight. “Biometric Information” means information that is based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.
What we collect and how we use it.
We may collect and use certain Biometric Information to verify or authenticate your identity; to protect against fraud; and for safety and other security purposes. We collect Biometric Information when you consent to voice or facial authentication. When you permit us to scan your face geometry or create a voiceprint, we turn it into a stored numerical representation (the “template”). Each time you scan your face geometry or later when you speak to one of our representatives, we compare your face or your voice to the stored template associated with your account. If they match, we are able to authenticate you so that you can access account information, complete account transactions, get assistance from a Verizon representative, or visit a Verizon corporate office.
When we
disclose Biometric Information.
We may disclose Biometric Information to service providers who work on our behalf. These service providers may use the Biometric Information disclosed to them only for purposes related to providing service to Verizon, and are required to delete the information when it is no longer needed to provide the service. We may also disclose Biometric Information to comply with law as described in the Does Verizon Disclose Information section of this Policy.
How long we retain Biometric Information.
We retain Biometric Information as follows (unless we are legally required to retain it longer):
We retain scans of your face geometry or voiceprint very briefly. We permanently delete the first scan after we use it to generate the stored template. Each time you authenticate, we retain your face geometry or voiceprint scan long enough to compare it to the template, then we permanently delete the scan.
We retain the stored template until the purpose for collecting it is satisfied. For instance, we retain stored templates of face scans for approximately 90 days from the date that you provided it. We retain voiceprints for as long as you are an active customer and are enrolled in voice authentication. Voiceprints are deleted approximately 24 hours after unenrollment or termination of service.
We may also retain biometric data as otherwise required to comply with applicable law or valid legal/judicial process.

If we begin collecting such information in the future, we will give you the right to opt out of its use and disclosure.

Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to explain how the Verizon companies (which we will collectively refer to in this policy as “Verizon”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collect and use your personal data. Privacy laws around the globe require Verizon to provide you with certain information applicable to our collection of your personal data. In addition to this general policy, you may receive additional information as to how we use your personal data based upon how you interact with us.
What types of personal data does Verizon collect?

How does Verizon use the personal data It collects?
Verizon uses your personal data for various purposes, including providing our services, enabling your account, billing, technical support, product development, and payment application. For telematics customers, Verizon may link vehicle and driving information to personal data. In addition, Verizon uses personal data to improve services that Verizon offers to its customers and to combat fraud and other illegal activity.
We may also use your personal data to contact you regarding our products and services, including survey requests. We will use your personal data for marketing or other purposes unrelated to your specific service when this is in accordance with applicable data protection or privacy law and any preferences you express.
When you use Verizon websites and apps, information is collected about your device and your visit including dates, times and duration of visits to our sites (including whether you are a first-time or repeat visitor); browsing, searching and buying activity as you interact with our sites and apps; IP address; mobile telephone number; web addresses of the sites you come from and go to next, including whether you visited the website directly or were referred from another website or link; location information consistent with your browser settings and app choice; and information about your connection, including your device's browser, operating system, and platform type. We use this information for operational, performance measurement and other business purposes, and to help us deliver more relevant Verizon marketing messages on our websites, on non-Verizon websites. The marketing messages may be delivered by our representatives, via email, or via other Verizon services or devices. This information is also used to tailor the content you see and may also be used to assess the effectiveness of our sites and to help you should you request help with navigation problems on our sites.
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about a page on one of our websites, you will be asked to submit an email to your friend directly. Please do so only if you have the permission of your friend. If your friends refer you to us directly, we may in certain geographic locations use the contact information provided in order to market to you, in accordance with applicable law. In some of our geographic locations, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may monitor or record your telephone conversations with us for quality control, training, and security purposes.
We will provide specific information as required by applicable law about how we use your personal data based upon the particular service that Verizon provides to you or to your company.
Under the local laws in some countries, we must be able to describe the legal basis on which we rely to process your personal data. In most cases, we will process your personal data for our legitimate business interests (for example, to enable us to understand how our services are used and to derive knowledge that enables us to develop new services), when it is necessary for purposes of a contract, or when it is necessary for us to do so to meet our legal obligations. When we process your personal data for our legitimate business interests, we put in place safeguards to make sure that your privacy is protected and to ensure that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
In certain circumstances (for example, in relation to some of our marketing activities) and where required by law, we may ask for your consent to process your personal data, and you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this notice.
When does Verizon share personal data?
Verizon shares personal data outside the Verizon family of companies as described in this Privacy Policy and in the privacy notices for specific services, as set forth in agreements with our customers, with your consent, and otherwise where we have a legal basis to do so under applicable law.
We work closely with other businesses and companies in the Verizon family of companies, and we may share your personal data with them for purposes such as internal reporting, marketing, customer insights and service optimization.
Verizon uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services we provide. We share personal data with those vendors and partners when it is necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. We require that these vendors and partners protect the personal data we provide to them and limit their use of personal data to the purposes for which it was provided. We do not permit these types of vendors and partners to use this information for their own marketing purposes.
Verizon may also share personal data when it is (i) required or permitted to do so by law or regulatory obligation; (ii) necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with Verizon property or services—including as part of any procedure necessary to collect a customer debt—or our customers’ or others’ use of them; or (iii) in connection with any proposed or actual sale or other transfer of some or all of our assets. Such disclosures occur only in accordance with applicable laws.
Some of our websites or services may be offered jointly by Verizon and one of our partners. If you register for or use such websites or services, Verizon and the other company may receive personal data. For these jointly offered services, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy, which may include practices that are different from the practices described here.
Verizon websites and services may include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with Verizon pages you visit or services you use, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget.
For Verizon Enterprise Solutions customers in Japan, Verizon will jointly use personal data with its family of companies in the following manner. Verizon Japan Ltd will jointly use personal data as defined in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy with Verizon Business Network Services Inc. and the Verizon companies located in the countries in which Verizon Enterprise Solutions conducts businesses for the purposes set forth in Section 4 of this Privacy Policy by the means identified in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy.
Does Verizon transfer personal data internationally?
As a member of the Verizon family of companies worldwide, the Verizon company providing service to you may in accordance with law transfer your personal data to other members of the Verizon family of companies or to third party partners and suppliers. Entities that receive your personal data may use it only for the purpose(s) for which it was originally shared, and they must protect it from any further use. These companies may be located outside the country where you are located. Although these countries do not always have the same data protection or privacy laws in place as your country or may not be deemed to provide protections that are "adequate" or "equivalent" to the privacy requirements of your service country, the Verizon entity providing your service binds its global employees and third party providers to the same high standard of personal information protection that it commits to you. Verizon adopted Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for transfers of personal information within some of the Verizon group of companies and has contractual protections in place for other transfers.
The BCRs are available here:
www.verizon.com/about/privacy/binding-corporate-rules
. In addition, transfers may be based on your consent, which we will obtain at the appropriate time.
How does Verizon protect the personal data it collects?
Verizon takes customer confidentiality and security seriously. Verizon has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store, including social security numbers. Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information. Under our practices and policies, access to sensitive personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access. Personal data and other sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes, and we abide by applicable laws such as the National Tax Basic Act in South Korea that require us to retain personal data.
Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. Verizon maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store.
Data protection rights
Subject to applicable law, you may ask to access, update, correct, port, rectify and, where reasonably practical, delete your personal data, or withdraw your consent to our use of your personal data. You may exercise your rights by
emailing us
or contacting us through the Company Contact Details below. Please note, however, that withdrawing consent or choosing to delete some types of personal information may prevent us from supplying certain services to you as a customer, vendor or partner, or responding to your queries as a job applicant or contractor. In order to better protect you and safeguard your information, we take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your information.
If you are in the EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local authority responsible for privacy protection, and you may also have this right in other countries.
Policy updates
We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy, so please check back periodically for changes. You will be able to see that changes have been made by checking to see the effective date posted at the end of the policy. If Verizon elects to use or disclose your personal data in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our policy at the time we collected that information from you, we will give you a choice regarding such use or disclosure by appropriate means, which may include use of an opt out mechanism.
