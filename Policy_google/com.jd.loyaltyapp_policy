We are JD Sports Fashion Plc
             (we/us). We’re a retail company which means that we sell products and some services online
            and in our stores. When you use our websites, our apps or visit our stores, you give us some information about

            companies that are not part of the JD Sports Fashion Plc. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please

Why do we collect it?
To provide you with products, discounts, promotions, loyalty programmes and services including our websites and
                apps. There are also times when we will partner with other select trusted companies (we call these ‘brand
                partners’) to bring new promotions, new products, offers, experiences and loyalty programmes to our
                customers
To communicate with you, respond to queries and complaints and improve our business
We combine personal data that we get from other sources with personal data you give to us.  We use some
                of the information about you to build a picture of you (this is sometimes called profiling). We also use
                your information to advertise and produce reports so we can improve and develop our websites, apps, products
                and services and tailor our marketing to you.   We use information that we learn about you such as your
                gender, preferences, hobbies, interests, purchase history and how you react to the marketing we send you
                to make sure the marketing you receive from us and the way our websites and mobile apps are displayed to
                you are appropriate and tailored to you
We will receive your personal data from other companies or provide it to other companies if we merge with or
                acquire another business or if we work with our trusted brand partners to link the account you hold with
                us to the account you have with the other brand and to share information about your purchases with a brand
                partner where you have purchased that brand’s products and have asked us to link your accounts
We will also collect or produce non-personally identifiable information (that is, information that does not identify
                you) that we will use to look at how our customers like to shop and improve our online and instore experiences
                for our customers as a whole
You do not have to provide your personal data to us, however, without it, we may not be able to fulfil your order,
                provide other services to you or respond to your queries
What’s our legal basis?
Our lawful basis for processing your personal data depends on how it will be used, however, our lawful bases are:
Compliance with legal obligations (e.g. fraud prevention)
Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract with you (e.g. to complete your order and provide you
                with items you have bought)
Legitimate business interests (e.g. sending you marketing messages where you have not opted out) and
Consent (e.g. to send you push notifications)
Who do we share it with?
We do not, and will not, sell any of your information to any third party, including your name, address, email
                address or financial information
We do share your information with select trusted third parties including brand partners to enable us to provide
                our products and services to you, to send marketing and to improve our business
If you purchase goods from us online then, depending on which country you are in, we may share your personal data (including name, contact details, address and payment information) with other companies that are also part of the JD Group where this is necessary to fulfil your order. See below for further details.
Where do we store it and how long for?
We will only keep your information for as long as is necessary to do the things that we collected it for
We tend to keep your personal data for 6 years from collection but sometimes we will only hold it for a much
                shorter period
We will keep it for longer if the law requires us to
Sometimes, we will transfer your information outside the UK and the European Economic Area but only where we
                have taken steps to give it extra protections that are required by the law
How do we keep it safe?
Using the internet to send information can never be completely and utterly secure. We will always do our best
                to protect your data, but we cannot guarantee the security of your data that you send to our websites and
                mobile apps.  You send it at your own risk
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try and keep it
                safe
What rights do you have?

to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data
to ask us to erase your personal data (‘right to be forgotten’)
to object to our processing of your personal data
to move your personal data to another Data Controller

                                    from marketing and where you have purchased similar products and/or services or where
                                    you signed up to receive such updates (including third party updates) for example in
                                    connection with our account linking and brand partner loyalty programmes. We rely on
                                    our legitimate interests for these activities, and you have the right to object to processing
                                    of this nature at any time by contacting our data protection team using the details at
                                    the end of this privacy notice
Although you also benefit from many of the above activities, we are required to carry out a balancing
                            test of our legitimate business interests to ensure that the way we use your data for these purposes
                            does not unreasonably intrude on your rights under data protection law. We are satisfied that
                            processing of your data for these purposes does not unreasonably intrude upon your privacy and
                            that we can therefore reasonably rely on legitimate interests as our basis for the above-mentioned
                            processing activities

                            when you are near one of our stores. These notifications may include offers and promotions relevant
                            to you which are taking place at a nearby store or to let you know that an item in your wish
                            list is available at a nearby store
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by updating your marketing preferences in
                            your account, turning off push notifications/location data using the settings in your mobile
                            device and/or contacting our data protection team using the details below

We always give you the choice of whether or not you wish to receive marketing communications from

                            rely on your consent or our legitimate interests to process your data for marketing purposes,
                            as explained above.

Where do we store it and how long for?
Sometimes, the information we collect about you will be transferred outside the UK and the European Economic Area but
            only where we have taken steps to give it extra protections that are required by the law.  Depending
            on where we are sending your information, this may include using some extra protections called Standard
            Contractual Clauses, the UK Addendum or UK International Data Transfer Agreement.  These are additional
            safeguards that we put into our agreements with the companies that we give your data to.  We can give you
            more information about these added protections if you want it.  Just ask us using the contact info below.
We will only keep your information for as long as is necessary to do the things that we collected it for (the things
            we’ve set out in this privacy notice) unless the law requires us to keep it longer.  We typically
            keep your personal data for 6 years from the date we collect it.  This usually allows us to deal with any
            issues or concerns you may have about the products or services you have received, and for other legal reasons
            such as if we need to keep your information to bring or defend legal proceedings etc. In some circumstances,
            some of your data will be deleted in much shorter timescales, for example:
Cookies - deleted in accordance with our
cookies policy
CCTV images – deleted after 60 days
If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and
            abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions or other legal rights, we will also keep hold of some of your information,
            even if it is no longer needed to provide our services to you.
How do we keep it safe?
Using the internet to send information can never be completely and utterly secure. We will always do our best to
            protect your data, but we cannot guarantee the security of your data that you send to our websites and mobile
            apps.   You send it at your own risk
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try and keep it safe
What rights do you have?

to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data
to ask us to erase your personal data (‘right to be forgotten’)

to move your personal data to another Data Controller
to withdraw your consent
to not be subject to automated decisions

What automated decisions do we make about you?
We use some of the information about you to build a picture of you (‘profiling’). This is for the purposes
            of improving and developing our products and services and to help us to tailor our marketing to you. We use information
            that we learn about you such as your gender, preferences, hobbies, interests, purchase history and how you react
            to the marketing we send you to make sure the marketing you receive from us, and the way our websites and mobile
            apps are displayed to you, are appropriate and tailored to you.
What’s our legal basis?
Compliance with legal obligations
We must comply with the law. This requires us to use your data to verify your identity and to prevent
                            fraud and other types of crime. If you choose not to give us certain information when signing
                            up for an account and when using our websites and mobile apps, we may not be able to sell you
                            our products or provide our other services
Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract with you
When you buy our products, you enter a contract with us.  To fulfil our obligations under the
                            contract (e.g. to allow you to place an order and receive products from us), we will process
                            your personal information. If you do not provide the information we need or if you ask us to
                            delete this information, it may mean we cannot sell you our products
Legitimate business interests
We use your personal data for the following, which we do because they are in the legitimate interests
                            of our business:
Providing you with products you want and developing and improving our products
Researching and understanding our customers and how they buy and use our products
Offering promotions and loyalty programmes, including jointly with select brand partners
Passing your data to other companies within the JD Group and to selected third parties including
                                    brand partners
Managing your account and running our websites and apps
Linking the account you have with us to the accounts you have with brand partners. This may

updating our websites and mobile apps
enforcing or applying rights under any contract between us
ensuring the health and safety of our customers and the security of our data and property

Where necessary when merging with or acquiring another business or re-organising our business,
                                    in which case some of your information may be shared with a prospective buyer or otherwise
                                    but only so far as is strictly necessary for the purposes of such sale or administration
sending you marketing communications where you have not told us that you wish to unsubscribe
                                    from marketing and where you have purchased similar products and/or services or where
                                    you signed up to receive such updates (including third party updates) for example in
                                    connection with our account linking and brand partner loyalty programmes. We rely on
                                    our legitimate interests for these activities, and you have the right to object to processing
                                    of this nature at any time by contacting our data protection team using the details at
                                    the end of this privacy notice
Although you also benefit from many of the above activities, we are required to carry out a balancing
                            test of our legitimate business interests to ensure that the way we use your data for these purposes
                            does not unreasonably intrude on your rights under data protection law. We are satisfied that
                            processing of your data for these purposes does not unreasonably intrude upon your privacy and
                            that we can therefore reasonably rely on legitimate interests as our basis for the above-mentioned
                            processing activities

                            rely on your consent or our legitimate interests to process your data for marketing purposes,
                            as explained above.

Where do we store it and how long for?
Sometimes, the information we collect about you will be transferred outside the UK and the European Economic Area but
            only where we have taken steps to give it extra protections that are required by the law.  Depending
            on where we are sending your information, this may include using some extra protections called Standard
            Contractual Clauses, the UK Addendum or UK International Data Transfer Agreement.  These are additional
            safeguards that we put into our agreements with the companies that we give your data to.  We can give you
            more information about these added protections if you want it.  Just ask us using the contact info below.
We will only keep your information for as long as is necessary to do the things that we collected it for (the things
            we’ve set out in this privacy notice) unless the law requires us to keep it longer.  We typically
            keep your personal data for 6 years from the date we collect it.  This usually allows us to deal with any
            issues or concerns you may have about the products or services you have received, and for other legal reasons
            such as if we need to keep your information to bring or defend legal proceedings etc. In some circumstances,
            some of your data will be deleted in much shorter timescales, for example:
Cookies - deleted in accordance with our
cookies policy
CCTV images – deleted after 60 days
If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and
            abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions or other legal rights, we will also keep hold of some of your information,
            even if it is no longer needed to provide our services to you.
How do we keep it safe?
Using the internet to send information can never be completely and utterly secure. We will always do our best to
            protect your data, but we cannot guarantee the security of your data that you send to our websites and mobile
            apps.   You send it at your own risk
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try and keep it safe
