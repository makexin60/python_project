PERSONAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
We may disclose your personal information for our business purposes and as legally required or permitted by law. Please see below for examples of circumstances in which we disclose information. We do not disclose or share your personal information with others except as indicated below, as directed by you, or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. Under no circumstances, other than as described herein, will Pro Referral transfer names and contact information (“Customer Lists”) to an unaffiliated third party for the third party’s own use.
Circumstance under which we may disclose your personal information:
To Provide Information to Pros.
We may disclose your personal information with Pros. The information we disclose is generally the information contained in the Service Request form, including the username (and first name of the customer when we have it), email address, phone number, the type of service needed, when and the zip code where the service should be performed, a description of the service needed, and any photographs you provide pertaining to the Service Request.
To Provide Information to Customers.
If you are a registered Pro, we may disclose your and your contractors’ and consultants’ personal information with Customers requesting services through Pro Referral. Sharing this information with Customers helps them to assess Pro quality and select the Pro to perform the service they need done. The information we disclose is generally the information in your Skill Profile, with the exception of your address, contact phone number, mobile phone number, and email address. In addition, we disclose any additional information you choose to provide to the Customer such as appointment start times, private notes, and questions about the Service Request. If you are selected by the Customer, Pro Referral will then, and only then, disclose your address, contact phone number, and email address with the Customer in order to facilitate communication about the scheduled job.
To Provide Information to Partner Companies.
We may enter into agreements with one or more partner companies pursuant to which we provide a partner company with a URL and a user registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the partner company, and the partner company distributes and promotes the URL to its customers. A partner company may want to access personal information that we collect from its customers. As a result, if you register on our website or other application through a partner company, or if you are directed to or access our website, or other application or their features (such as but not limited to an embedded widget) through a partner company, we may provide your personal information to the partner company. Because we do not control the privacy practices of our partner companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.
To Facilitate Pro Referral’s Use of Service Providers.
We engage certain trusted service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, software services and support, data storage and management, joint marketing efforts, customer satisfaction surveys, advertising, advisory and consulting services, background checks, security services, and fraud prevention services.
For Pros, in addition to above, we will disclose your personal information to background check providers.
To Comply with Laws and Law Enforcement.
We may disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement, public, and government authorities, and other entities as we deem reasonably necessary to comply with the law, support investigations, and protect the rights and property of you, us, and others. For example, we will disclose information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also disclose information if a government agency or investigatory body requests it.
In Connection with Business Transfers.
Pro Referral may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of its assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing of your personal information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.
To Provide Information to Pro Referral Affiliates.
We may disclose your personal information with a company controlled by, or under common control with, Pro Referral for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy.

Online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select.

This may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the webpages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements or links on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use this information to monitor the use of the applications and of our Service, and for the applications’ technical administration.
We use tools like browser cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons to collect information when you interact with our applications.

When you respond to a customer’s Service Request, all of the Business Information is displayed to the customer making such Service Request. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but may enable you to market your services more effectively and potentially win more jobs on the applications.

PERSONAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
We may disclose your personal information for our business purposes and as legally required or permitted by law. Please see below for examples of circumstances in which we disclose information. We do not disclose or share your personal information with others except as indicated below, as directed by you, or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. Under no circumstances, other than as described herein, will Pro Referral transfer names and contact information (“Customer Lists”) to an unaffiliated third party for the third party’s own use.
Circumstance under which we may disclose your personal information:
To Provide Information to Pros.
We may disclose your personal information with Pros. The information we disclose is generally the information contained in the Service Request form, including the username (and first name of the customer when we have it), email address, phone number, the type of service needed, when and the zip code where the service should be performed, a description of the service needed, and any photographs you provide pertaining to the Service Request.
To Provide Information to Customers.
If you are a registered Pro, we may disclose your and your contractors’ and consultants’ personal information with Customers requesting services through Pro Referral. Sharing this information with Customers helps them to assess Pro quality and select the Pro to perform the service they need done. The information we disclose is generally the information in your Skill Profile, with the exception of your address, contact phone number, mobile phone number, and email address. In addition, we disclose any additional information you choose to provide to the Customer such as appointment start times, private notes, and questions about the Service Request. If you are selected by the Customer, Pro Referral will then, and only then, disclose your address, contact phone number, and email address with the Customer in order to facilitate communication about the scheduled job.
To Provide Information to Partner Companies.
We may enter into agreements with one or more partner companies pursuant to which we provide a partner company with a URL and a user registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the partner company, and the partner company distributes and promotes the URL to its customers. A partner company may want to access personal information that we collect from its customers. As a result, if you register on our website or other application through a partner company, or if you are directed to or access our website, or other application or their features (such as but not limited to an embedded widget) through a partner company, we may provide your personal information to the partner company. Because we do not control the privacy practices of our partner companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.
To Facilitate Pro Referral’s Use of Service Providers.
We engage certain trusted service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, software services and support, data storage and management, joint marketing efforts, customer satisfaction surveys, advertising, advisory and consulting services, background checks, security services, and fraud prevention services.
For Pros, in addition to above, we will disclose your personal information to background check providers.
To Comply with Laws and Law Enforcement.
We may disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement, public, and government authorities, and other entities as we deem reasonably necessary to comply with the law, support investigations, and protect the rights and property of you, us, and others. For example, we will disclose information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also disclose information if a government agency or investigatory body requests it.
In Connection with Business Transfers.
Pro Referral may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of its assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing of your personal information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.
To Provide Information to Pro Referral Affiliates.
We may disclose your personal information with a company controlled by, or under common control with, Pro Referral for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy.

Information Collected Upon Visiting.
When you visit our websites or applications, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the webpages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements or links on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use this information to monitor the use of the applications and of our Service, and for the applications’ technical administration.
We use tools like browser cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons to collect information when you interact with our applications.
Information Collected Upon Registration.
If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the applications, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personal information to Pro Referral. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Pro Referral service, if you desire to receive marketing materials and information, if you submit a Service Request, and/or if you create a Skill Profile to offer services through Pro Referral. Information that we may collect in such instances may include your full name, password, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number for text messages, photographs you upload, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile. If you register as a Pro or create a Skill Profile we will ask for additional information related to your business, including street address, and other personal information as noted in this Privacy Policy.
Skill Profile Information.
If you create a Skill Profile, you have the opportunity to provide additional information (“Business Information”) such as your business name, logo or avatar, credentials and qualifications, year of business establishment, as well as links to your personal website, if you have one. You may also upload a photograph portfolio of your previous work. We may supplement or modify the Business Information to conform to our editorial policies or to add information from your website, materials that you supply to us, or publicly available sources. When you respond to a customer’s Service Request, all of the Business Information is displayed to the customer making such Service Request. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but may enable you to market your services more effectively and potentially win more jobs on the applications. If you contact us by email through the applications, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence and use such information to respond to your inquiry.

PERSONAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
We may disclose your personal information for our business purposes and as legally required or permitted by law. Please see below for examples of circumstances in which we disclose information. We do not disclose or share your personal information with others except as indicated below, as directed by you, or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. Under no circumstances, other than as described herein, will Pro Referral transfer names and contact information (“Customer Lists”) to an unaffiliated third party for the third party’s own use.
Circumstance under which we may disclose your personal information:
To Provide Information to Pros.
We may disclose your personal information with Pros. The information we disclose is generally the information contained in the Service Request form, including the username (and first name of the customer when we have it), email address, phone number, the type of service needed, when and the zip code where the service should be performed, a description of the service needed, and any photographs you provide pertaining to the Service Request.
To Provide Information to Customers.
If you are a registered Pro, we may disclose your and your contractors’ and consultants’ personal information with Customers requesting services through Pro Referral. Sharing this information with Customers helps them to assess Pro quality and select the Pro to perform the service they need done. The information we disclose is generally the information in your Skill Profile, with the exception of your address, contact phone number, mobile phone number, and email address. In addition, we disclose any additional information you choose to provide to the Customer such as appointment start times, private notes, and questions about the Service Request. If you are selected by the Customer, Pro Referral will then, and only then, disclose your address, contact phone number, and email address with the Customer in order to facilitate communication about the scheduled job.
To Provide Information to Partner Companies.
We may enter into agreements with one or more partner companies pursuant to which we provide a partner company with a URL and a user registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the partner company, and the partner company distributes and promotes the URL to its customers. A partner company may want to access personal information that we collect from its customers. As a result, if you register on our website or other application through a partner company, or if you are directed to or access our website, or other application or their features (such as but not limited to an embedded widget) through a partner company, we may provide your personal information to the partner company. Because we do not control the privacy practices of our partner companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.
To Facilitate Pro Referral’s Use of Service Providers.
We engage certain trusted service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, software services and support, data storage and management, joint marketing efforts, customer satisfaction surveys, advertising, advisory and consulting services, background checks, security services, and fraud prevention services.
For Pros, in addition to above, we will disclose your personal information to background check providers.
To Comply with Laws and Law Enforcement.
We may disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement, public, and government authorities, and other entities as we deem reasonably necessary to comply with the law, support investigations, and protect the rights and property of you, us, and others. For example, we will disclose information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also disclose information if a government agency or investigatory body requests it.
In Connection with Business Transfers.
Pro Referral may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of its assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing of your personal information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.
To Provide Information to Pro Referral Affiliates.
We may disclose your personal information with a company controlled by, or under common control with, Pro Referral for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy.

If you are a registered user of an application, you may access and update or correct the information you provided to us by updating your settings in your account and /or your Skill Profile in Manage Profiles. If you wish to delete your account, you must email
support@ProReferral.com
with your request, which will be acted upon within 21 days.

When you visit our website, we use cookies and similar tools to automatically make certain personal information available to select third parties who are providing services to us to help us enhance your experience, improve and deliver advertising, learn how you use the website, and achieve the other purposes addressed in the “Our Tracking Tools” section of our Privacy and Security Statement. Some of those select third parties may use the personal information for their own purposes or to provide services to other businesses. This disclosure may be considered a “sale” of your personal information. If you want to opt out of such automatic sharing, use this form to submit an Opt Out of Sale request, and we will place a key in your local storage and a cookie on your browser to automatically prevent the sharing from happening when you use that browser to visit our website. Because we use a cookie to automatically identify and register your preference, if you disable cookies on your browser or device, or clear your local storage, the Opt Out of Sale request will no longer work. You can always enable cookies on your browser or device and visit this page again to register your Opt Out of Sale request. We may not recognize you when you use other browsers or devices to visit our website. So, you will need to submit a separate Opt Out of Sale request on each device and browser you use to visit our website. For more information about our tracking tools and how to control them, please click

.
After you submit an Opt Out of Sale request, you may still see advertising regarding our products and services. And some of that advertising may be delivered by third parties or appear on third-party sites or services. This advertising may be general audience advertising or may be delivered by service providers in ways that do not involve sales of your personal information.
When you submit your Opt Out of Sale request using the form below, as indicated above, we will no longer share your information via digital tracking technologies used on homedepot.com. You may need to take other steps for other websites, as described in the privacy policies for those websites. We also will use the information you provide via the form to identify the personal information not involving online tracking technologies that we hold about you so that we can honor your request that such information no longer be sold as well.
Once you submit your request, we will place a key in your local storage and a  cookie on your browser to automatically prevent the sharing from happening when you use the browser to visit our website. However, to fully register your Opt Out of Sale request for information that may be shared via channels other than online tracking technologies, if any, you will need to provide a working email address.
We also recognize the “Global Privacy Control” (GPC) to allow you to opt out of the sale of your personal information and the sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising on homedepot.com. Please see our Privacy and Security Statement for more information related to using GPC on our websites.
