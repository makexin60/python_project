Candidate Privacy Statement
Last Revised: December 2022
Your privacy is important to General Motors Holdings, LLC (
GM
or
we/our
) as is your trust. We want you to know that the information you share with us will be treated with care.
This Candidate Privacy Statement (
Privacy Statement
) addresses the personal information we collect and how we use and share that personal information throughout the General Motors recruitment and hiring process. This Privacy Statement applies to personal information we obtain from and about individuals who apply for a job, register in our talent community, attend a recruitment event, complete an assessment, or otherwise participate in other recruitment processes with GM.
This Privacy Statement was developed pursuant to laws and regulations relating to the processing or protection of personal information applicable to GM in the jurisdictions where this Privacy Statement applies (
Data Privacy Laws
). Where there is a conflict between this Privacy Statement and the applicable Data Privacy Law, the Data Privacy Law controls.
Candidates may also be consumers of GM products and personal information may also be collected in that relationship. This consumer personal information will be handled as explained in the applicable consumer privacy statement.
Please take a moment to review our Privacy Statement and contact us if you have any questions.

The GM recruiting and hiring process consists of multiple steps designed to evaluate your skills and qualifications for a particular position. If you choose to apply, you will be asked to provide GM with personal information. In many cases, this personal information is required to complete the GM hiring process, but we will do our best to tell you about optional personal information when we collect it.
GM collects, among others, the following personal information:
Contact information
► including name, address, email address, phone number, and communication preferences
Demographic information
► including date of birth, gender and gender identity, marital status, nationality and citizenship status, trade union membership, military or veteran status, race/ethnicity, and status as a person with a disability
Identification information
► including citizen identification numbers issued by government bodies or agencies (e.g., depending on the country you are from, social security, citizen service or Personal Public Service number or national insurance number, passport number, tax identification number, driver’s license number) or work permit(s)
Education and training related information
► including academic certificates and curriculum vitae
Work experience information
► including employment history, professional certifications, references, or other information you provide
Interview and assessment information
► including appraisals, assessments, feedback, and information you provide during phone screenings and interviews
Photos & videos
► including recordings of interviews and assessments of video interviews
Background screening information
► including, where applicable, the results of pre-hire background screenings of any kind such as credit and criminal background checks, educational background checks, motor vehicle record checks, drug and alcohol testing, and other pre-employment screenings
We may also collect or receive information about you from third parties, such as when you engage a third party to complete your application for you or from information you or others have posted publicly to job boards or other places. We will handle personal information the same regardless of whether we collect it or receive it from a third party.
GM will use the personal information we collect about you as required to carry out our recruiting and hiring processes, as necessary to comply with legal obligations applicable to GM, for our own legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties we are engaged with, or with your consent where required by Data Privacy Laws. As such, we may use your personal information for the following legitimate business purposes:
to match your skills and interest to GM job requirements throughout the application, recruiting and hiring process
to identify opportunities at GM that we think may be of interest to you
to communicate with you
to perform data analytics, reporting, and benchmarking to improve the hiring process
to inform our recruitment and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) strategies
to secure our network and information security assets
to comply our legal and regulatory obligations
Where processing is based on consent you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Any withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal, and GM will continue to retain the information that you provided us before you withdrew your consent for as long as allowed or required by applicable law.
The company does not make any decisions concerning your employment application solely by automated means.
GM may share the personal information we collect about you in the following instances:
within GM and, with our GM controlled subsidiaries and affiliates for the uses described above
with our service providers who work on our behalf and who do not have an independent right to use the information to which they have access or that we disclose to them, such as with background screening suppliers for information verification
with third parties for research and development purposes
in connection with the sale, transfer, or financing of a significant part of a GM business or our assets, including any such activities associated with a bankruptcy proceeding
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a law enforcement request
as required or permitted by law, such as in conjunction with a subpoena, government inquiry, government reporting requirements, litigation, dispute resolution, or similar legal process
Apart from the purposes listed above, GM will not share information about you with other third parties for their independent use without your permission, or where required by Data Privacy Laws, your consent.
GM may collect and process personal information of a more sensitive nature (known in some jurisdictions as special categories of personal data or sensitive personal information) when you voluntarily provide this information to GM, when we receive it from a third party with your consent, when relevant for a particular position to carry out our obligations under employment laws, or as Data Privacy Laws otherwise permit. Examples of sensitive personal information include information concerning religion, race/ethnicity, ethnic origin, political opinions or other beliefs, union affiliation or activities, health, sexuality, or criminal administrative proceedings or sanctions.
Within the GM hiring process, we may process the following sensitive personal information:
Physical or mental health condition, drug, or disability status to determine appropriate workplace accommodations and evaluate fitness for a particular position
Race/ethnicity, citizenship status, nationality, ethnic origin, or trade union membership to comply with statutory obligations
Previous criminal charges or convictions where relevant for the position
Where we have a legitimate need to process this sensitive personal information about you for purposes not identified above, we will only do so only after providing you with notice and, if required by Data Privacy Laws, obtaining your prior, express consent.
GM is a global company and therefore may need to transfer your data to a country outside of where it was collected. Typically, data is transferred to the United States for processing, although personal information may be transferred to any location where GM, our subsidiaries or our service providers operate worldwide. By engaging with the GM hiring process or visiting the GM careers site you acknowledge and agree to the transfer of your personal information to countries outside of your country of residence that may not have the same data privacy laws as those in your home country. GM complies with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information, including, where applicable, standard contractual clauses. See “How To Contact Us” below for questions or, where applicable, to request a copy of these standard contractual clauses.
