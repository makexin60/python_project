Privacy Procedures
‍
Uses of Personal Information Collected
‍
Internal Usage:
We use Contact Data obtained from your PI to send you communications about our Company or our Services, items you’ve requested, and to contact you when necessary. We use your Financial Data to bill you for our Services. We may use your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your experience on the Site, displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences or may be relevant to the Services being offered to you.
Service Providers:
To complete usual and routine business transactions, we share certain categories of PI we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We may share Demographic Data and Product Data with advertisers, insurance providers, and other third-parties only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. We also may share Contact Data and Product Data, and Financial Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Site.
All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties for marketing purposes.
‍
Law Enforcement and Data Security
We may be obligated to share your PI in other, limited circumstances. For example, we may be required to disclose certain information in response to a subpoena or similar judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies.
Unanticpated Uses:
Periodically, we may use PI for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use data collected from the time of the policy change moving forward for these new purposes. Additionally, we reserve the right to transfer PI to a successor in interest that acquires rights to the information as a result of the sale of the Company, a division of the Company, or some or all of the assets of the Company. Please note that we will not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. However, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect changes in use of PI.
User Choice Regarding Collection, Use, and Distribution of Personal Information.
If you do not want us to share your PI with any third parties or to request that we remove your PI from our database please send us an email at support@bajabeachfest.com, but please allow a reasonable time for us to process this request and understand that such a request will likely limit your ability to take advantage of all of the features and Services we offer on the Site.
Please understand that your election to opt-out is only effective with respect to the future delivery of communications sent directly from the Company. You may still receive solicitations from third parties who have already received your PI. If you wish to stop receiving communications from any such source, you will need to contact each third party to unsubscribe from their individual mailing and contact lists, as each third party maintains its own separate databases. If, in the future, we decide to use PI for uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy, you may prevent the PI from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by sending us an email or writing to us at the address listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Opting out of Marketing Communications
To no longer receive marketing communications from us, you can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the emails you receive from us, by changing your marketing preferences through your account settings, or by contacting us through the ‘Contact Us page on our Site.
How We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals.
The Company does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to web browser’s Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. However, some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.  You may set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (including advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
Third Party Links to Other Sites:
The Site contains links to other websites that may not be owned or operated by us. The fact that we may link to those websites does not indicate any approval or endorsement of those websites. We have no control over those websites. We are not responsible for the content of those websites, or the privacy practices of those websites. We strongly encourage you to become familiar with the terms of use and practices of any linked website. Your use of other websites is at your own risk and is subject to the terms of those websites. It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever links you select or software you download (whether from the Site or other sites) is free of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, defects, date bombs, time bombs and other items of a destructive nature.
Changing or Deleting Information:
We may provide Site users with access to, and the ability to update and/or correct, certain information that we maintain about them, such as Contact Data (e.g., name, address, phone number) or user preferences, that is contained in their user profile, by logging into their account and accessing the Site, sending us an email, or writing to us at the address listed below.
