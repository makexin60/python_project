3. Why must I have a deposit?
Deposits are required for all new customers and customers with an adverse credit history.  Since utilities are billed 1 month in arrears, the deposit is meant to offset the final bill.  A “high-risk” or double deposit will be required for customers with an adverse credit check and may be imposed at any time payments are past due.
***MAKING PAYMENTS LATE MAY CAUSE ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS TO BE BILLED***
In the next few months you may see deposits billed to your account.  By City Ordinance all residential accounts must have a deposit unless they have had 12 months of on-time pay at which time the deposit will be applied back to the account.  If payments are made late at any point after the deposit has been applied back to the account, a "normal" deposit will be billed to the account.  If Payments are made late 3 consecutive months or 5 times in a 12 month period, a "high risk" deposit will be required.  A "high risk" deposit is also required if the account has been at "shut-off" status in the last 12 months.  A "normal" deposit is $100 for electric and $50 for water.  These amounts double for "high risk" accounts.  If your account is assessed an additional deposit, it will be billed at $50 per month until the deposit on the account reached the required amount.
For commercial accounts, deposits mus remain for the life of the account.  Late payments will result in double deposits.  Commercial deposits are based on the average usage of the account.  City Ordinance requires that commercial accounts be audited to make sure that deposits are adequate for the recent usage.  That audit was completed in February.  If additional deposits are required on commercial accounts, they will begin to be billed in the March billing cycle each year.
4. When do I get my deposit back?
Deposits are credited back to your account after 12 consecutive months of on-time payments for residential customers.  Commercial accounts must maintain cash deposit or other approved form of deposit as long as the account is active.
5. When can I expect my first bill?
Depending on when your service was connected, you should generally receive your first bill in 2-8 weeks and it will be due approximately 3 weeks after you receive it.  It is advisable to make a payment toward your first bill even before you receive it since it could include your usage for up to 60 days.  Call our office at 776-5923 and we can help you estimate what you might want to pay.
6. What other charges will I have to pay?
You will be billed a $15 connect fee on your first bill and a $15 disconnect on your last bill. Other possible charges include: $30 reconnect fee or $80 after hours reconnect fee if you are disconnected for non-pay; $30 return check fee if your check is returned by your bank; if meter-tampering is found at your residence, you will be charged for actual usage, any damages to equipment plus a charge equal to 3 times the highest monthly bill in the last 12 months (meter-tampering will be prosecuted and court costs would be charged to the offender along with any fines imposed by the courts).
7. Who do I call if I have an electrical or water outage?
All utility service outages should be reported to 776-5930. This is a 24-hour number.
8. Why do I have to come into the utility office to connect or disconnect service?
City of Benton Ordinances require that utilities service be in the name of the adult persons living in the residence, therefore we must see photo I.D.’s.  We also require personal information such as Social Security numbers.  This information needs to be closely guarded for your protection, so sending by fax or other means is unacceptable.  Having the customers come into the office also prevents practical jokes and malicious acts by other people toward our customers.
