We use cookies on our website and our mobile apps. Cookies are small files automatically created by your browser and stored on your end device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our website or use our mobile apps. Cookies do not harm your end device and do not contain viruses, Trojan horses or other malware. The cookie stores information created in connection with the specific end device used. However, this does not mean that we obtain direct knowledge of your identity. One purpose of cookies is help us make using our offer more enjoyable for you. For example, we may use so-called session cookies to detect that you have already visited individual pages on our website or used our mobile apps. These are automatically deleted after your leave our website or our mobile apps. We also use temporary cookies to optimize user friendliness. They are stored on your end device for a specific fixed amount of time. If you visit our website or use our mobile apps to access our services again, it is automatically recognized that you have already been there and what inputs and settings you provided so that you need not enter these again. We also use cookies to record statistics about the use of our website or mobile apps and analyze them in order to optimize our offer for you (see number 3). If you visit our website or our mobile apps again, these cookies allow us to automatically detect that you have already been there. These cookies are always automatically deleted after a defined time. The data processed by cookies is needed for the stated purposes to protect our legitimate interests as well as those of third parties pursuant to Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, point (f) of the GDPR. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or so that a notice always appears before a new cookie is created. However, wholesale deactivation of cookies may lead to you not being able to use all the functions of our website or our mobile apps.
9. Analytical tools
9.1. Tracking tools
The tracking measures listed below and used by us are implemented based on Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, point (f) of the GDPR. The tracking measures used are intended to ensure needs-based design and continuous optimization of our website or our mobile apps. We also use tracking measures to record statistics about the use of our website or mobile apps and analyze them in order to optimize our offer for you. These interests are legitimate as defined by the regulation cited above. The particular data processing aims and data categories can be found in the corresponding tracking tools.
9.1.1. Google Analytics
For purposes of needs-based design and continuous optimization of our pages, we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (
https://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/
) (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter “
Google
“). Pseudonymized use profiles are generated and cookies (see number 4) are used in this context. The information about your use of our website or our mobile apps generated by the cookie, such as
Browser type/version,
Operating system used,
Referrer URL (previously visited page),
Host name of accessing computer (IP address),
Time of server query, is sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The information is used to analyze the use of our website or our mobile apps, to compile reports about website activities, and to perform other services related to website use and Internet use for purposes of market research and needs-based design of our website or our mobile apps. This information may also be sent to third parties if required by law or if third parties are processing this data on a contract basis. Under no circumstances will your IP address be linked to other Google data. IP addresses are anonymized to make association impossible (IP masking).
You can prevent cookies from being installed by disabling the corresponding setting in your browser software; however, we advise that in this case the full functionally of our website may not be able to be used. You can also prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie about your use of our website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
). As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile end devices, you can also prevent collection by Google Analytics by clicking on
this link
. An opt-out cookie is placed that prevents the future collection of your data when visiting our website. The opt-out cookie is only active in this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device. If you delete cookies on this browser, you must replace the opt-out cookie. You can find further information about data privacy in relation to Google Analytics in Google Analytics Help (
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de
).
9.1.2. Google Adwords conversion
We also use Google conversion tracking to record statistics about the use of our website or our mobile apps and analyze them in order to optimize our website or our mobile apps for you. Google Adwords places a cookie (see number 8) on your computer if you arrived at our website through a Google ad on our website or our mobile apps. These cookies expire after 30 days and do not act as personal identification. If the user visits certain pages on the website or mobile apps of the Adwords customer and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can detect that the user clicked on the ad and was forwarded to this page. Data privacy authorities require a contract data processing agreement to be concluded for lawful use of Google Analytics. Google offers a template at
http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.pdf
. Every Adwords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies therefore cannot be traced through the websites or mobile apps of Adwords customers. The information obtained using conversion cookies helps create conversion statistics for Adwords customers that have chosen to use conversation tracking. Adwords customers learn the total number of users who have clicked on their ad and been forwarded to a website or mobile app that has a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that could personally identify users. If you don’t want to participate in tracking, you can also refuse placement of a cookie required for this, for example using a browser setting that deactivates automatic placement of cookies in general. You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser so that cookies from the domain “www.googleadservices.com” are blocked. You can find Google’s data privacy notice about conversion tracking here (
https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html
).
9.1.3. Matomo
We use the open source software Matomo for analysis and statistical evaluation of the use of the website or our mobile apps. This uses cookies (see number 4). The information about website use or the use of our mobile apps generated by the cookie is sent to our servers and summarized in pseudonymous use profiles. The information is used to analyze the use of our website or our mobile apps and to allow needs-based design of our website or our mobile apps. The information is not disclosed to third parties. Under no circumstances is the IP address linked to other data about the user. IP addresses are anonymized to make association impossible (IP masking). Your visit to our website or our mobile app is recorded live by Matomo web analysis. Click here (

9.1.4. Facebook Analytics for Apps (Facebook Inc.)
Facebook Analytics for Apps is an analytics service provided by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The data collector in this regard is Facebook Ireland Ltd. (4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland). Facebook Analytics for Apps collects the usage data and various types of personal data as specified in the privacy policy of the service (

9.1.5. Fabric Answers (Google Inc.)
Fabric Answers is an analytics service provided by Crashlytics, a business division of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter “
Google
“) (“
Crashlytics
“). In order to understand Google’s use of data, please consult Google’s partner policy under (
https://policies.google.com/privacy
).
This service of Fabric Answers is designed for mobile apps analytics and can collect various information about your mobile phone, highlighted in the Fabric Answers privacy policy (
https://policies.google.com/privacy
). In particular, this application uses identifiers for mobile devices (including Android Advertising ID or Advertising Identifier for iOS, respectively) and technologies similar to cookies to run the Fabric Answers service.

https://policies.google.com/privacy
) to find a detailed explanation about the other tools used. You can opt-out certain Fabric Answers features through applicable device settings, such as the device advertising settings for mobile phones or by following the instructions in other Fabric related sections of this privacy policy, if available.

https://policies.google.com/privacy
) in this regard.
10. Social Media Plug-Ins
10.1. On the basis of Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, point (f) of the GDPR, we place social media plug-ins of the social networks Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram on our website or our mobile apps to raise our company’s profile through them. The advertising purpose behind this is considered a legitimate interest as defined by the GDPR. Responsibility for operation that complies with data privacy must be guaranteed by the respective providers. We incorporate these plug-ins using the so-called two-click method to protect users of our website or our mobile apps as well as we can.
10.1.1. Facebook
Our website or our mobile apps use Facebook social media plug-ins to personalize use. We use the “LIKE” or “SHARE” button to do this. This is an offer provided by Facebook. If you access a page of our website or our mobile apps that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook’s servers. Facebook sends the content of the plug-in directly to your browser, which incorporates it into our website or our mobile apps. The incorporation of the plug-ins gives Facebook the information that your browser has accessed the relevant page of our website or our mobile apps even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not logged into Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is sent by your browser directly to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can directly associate the visit to our website or our mobile apps with your Facebook account. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the “LIKE” or “SHARE” button, the corresponding information is also sent directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information is further published on Facebook and shown to your Facebook friends. Facebook may use this information for purposes of advertisement, market research, and needs-based design of Facebook pages. Facebook generates use, interest, and relationship profiles for this purpose, e.g. to analyze your use of our website or our mobile apps in relation to the advertisements displayed to you on Facebook, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website or our mobile apps, and to perform other services related to the use of Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to associate the data collected through our website or our mobile apps with your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before your visit to our website or our mobile apps. Please find the purpose and scope of the data collection and further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as your rights in this regard and possible settings for protecting your privacy in Facebook’s data privacy policy (
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/
).
10.1.2. Twitter
Plug-ins of the news and social network Twitter Inc. (Twitter) are integrated into our website or our mobile apps. You can recognize the Twitter plug-ins (tweet button) by the Twitter logo on our website or our mobile apps. You can find an overview of tweet buttons here (
https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons
). If you access a page of our website or our mobile apps that contains such a plug-in, a direct connection is created between your browser and the Twitter server. Twitter thereby receives the information that you have visited our website or our mobile apps with your IP address. If you click the Twitter “tweet button” while you are logged into your Twitter account, you can link to the content of our websites on your Twitter profile. This allows Twitter to associate the visit to our website or our mobile apps with your user account. We advise that, as the provider of our website or our mobile apps, we have no awareness of the content of the transmitted data or the use thereof by Twitter. If you do not want Twitter to be able to associate the visit to our website or our mobile apps, please log out of your Twitter user account. You can find further information about this in Twitter’s privacy policy (
https://twitter.com/privacy
).
10.1.3. Instagram
Our website or our mobile apps also use so-called social plug-ins (“plug-ins”) of Instagram that are operated by Instagram 3 LLC., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (“
Instagram
“). The plug-ins are identified by an Instagram logo, for example in the form of an “Instagram camera.” If you access a page of our website or our mobile apps that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to Instagram’s servers. Instagram sends the content of the plug-in directly to your browser, which incorporates it into the page. This incorporation gives Instagram the information that your browser has accessed the relevant page of our website or our mobile apps even if you do not have an Instagram account or are not logged into Instagram. This information (including your IP address) is sent by your browser directly to an Instagram server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged into Instagram, Instagram can directly associate the visit to our website or our mobile apps with your Instagram account. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the “Instagram” button, this information is also sent directly to an Instagram server and stored there. The information is also published on your Instagram account and displayed to your contacts there. If you do not want Instagram to associate the data collected through our website directly with your Instagram account, you must log out of Instagram before your visit to our website or our mobile apps. You can find further information about this in Instagram’s privacy policy (
https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388
).
11. YOUTUBE
11.1. In order to incorporate videos, our website uses the provider YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA, represented by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Normally, your IP address is sent to YouTube and cookies are installed on your computer as soon as you access a page with embedded videos. However, we have incorporated our YouTube videos using the enhanced data privacy mode (in this case, YouTube still contacts Google’s Double Click service, but according to Google’s privacy policy no personal data is analyzed). As a result, YouTube does not store more information about visitors unless you view the videos. If you click the video, your IP address is sent to YouTube and YouTube learns that you have viewed the video. If you are logged in to YouTube, this information is associated with your user account (you can prevent this by logging out of YouTube before accessing the video).
We have no knowledge of and no influence on potential further collection or use of your data by YouTube. You can find more detailed information in YouTube’s privacy policy under
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de&gl=de
. We also refer to number 8 of this Privacy Policy in regard to general handling of and deactivation of cookies.
12. ADVERTISING
12.1. SuperAwesome
SuperAwesome is a COPPA compliant advertising network that provides contextual advertising and does not collect identifiers to track users. We use the SuperAwesome Development Kits in some of our apps, which are provided by SuperAwesome Trading Limited, a private limited company incorporated in England (Company Number: 09769338), having its registered office at 22 Long Acre, London, WC2E 9LY (“
SuperAwesome
“). If you view one of the ads within our apps a hashed ID is created from your IDFA in combination with a randomized ID and non-personal information collected via your device. This hashed ID is also used for the purpose of ad frequency capping. If you as user have limited ad tracking through your device, then a hashed ID will not be created from this technical information and you may see certain ads more repetitively since there would be no ad frequency capping enabled.
Information that is collected through our apps by SuperAwesome in this regard will only be available to SuperAwesome as well as Fox & Sheep and is not shared with any third party. You can find further information about this under
https://www.superawesome.com/privacy-hub/awesomeads-privacy-policy/
12.2. Facebook Ads conversion tracking (Facebook, Inc.)
Facebook Ads conversion tracking is an analytics service provided by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The data collector in this regard is Facebook Ireland Ltd. (4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland). Facebook Ads conversion tracking connects data from the Facebook advertising network with actions performed on this app. Facebook Ads conversion tracking collects the usage data and cookies as specified in the privacy policy of the service (
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/
).
We use Facebook Ads conversion tracking for analysis and statistical evaluation of the use of our apps. We can use the statistics we obtain to improve our services and to make our apps for you as a user more interesting. For the cases, in which personal data is transferred to the USA, Facebook uses standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission. Furthermore, the transfer of data from the EEA to the United States and other countries can be based on adequacy decisions of the European Commission. For further information please click

C. When you instruct us to transfer data to third parties
Looker Studio Integration

Data Export
: Upon activation of the Matomo Connector, all data stored within your Matomo account will be exported to Looker Studio. This transfer is initiated by you and is under your control.
Data Privacy
: Once your data is exported to Looker Studio, it will be governed by the applicable
Looker Studio terms of service and policies
provided by Google. We strongly advise you to review their terms and policies and understand the implications before initiating the data transfer.
Privacy Considerations
: Transferring data, especially visitor data, to external platforms can have privacy implications. It's crucial to ensure that you have the necessary permissions and have considered the privacy ramifications of such a transfer.
Exclusive Connector Use
: To ensure the security and privacy of your data, we recommend exclusively using the
Matomo Connector
for this integration. Avoid using third-party connectors or tools for Looker Studio that claim compatibility with Matomo, as we cannot vouch for their security or data handling practices.
International transfers
If the EU GDPR or UK GDPR applies to our processing of your personal data, we receive it in New Zealand on the basis of adequacy decision.

Specifically, for the above processors and third-party services, we process or allow the data to be processed on the basis of adequacy or standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission, subject to data transfer impact assessments where required. More information on this is available from us upon request.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

X Privacy Policy
Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:
X is a public platform
Learn what’s viewable & searchable
We collect some data
about you
Learn what we collect & how
Affiliate services may have their own policies
Learn about affiliates
We use your data to make X better
Learn how we make your info work
You can control your experience
Learn how to update your settings
If you have questions about how we use data, just ask

10. How To Contact X
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us.
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
Personal Accounts.
If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
Professional Accounts.
If you create a
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.
Payment Information.
In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
Preferences.
When you set your preferences using your
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
Biometric Information.
Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.
Job Applications / Recommendations.
We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your activity on X, including:
Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.
We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).
Purchase and payments.
To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
Device Information.
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:
Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.
Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.
Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information.
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.
Inferred Identity.
We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:
When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.
When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.
Log Information.
We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:
IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identiﬁers; and identiﬁers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.
Advertisements.
When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).
Cookies and similar technologies.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.
3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether
videos you upload
are downloadable by others.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates
and third-party partners and
service providers
located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.
X is a
participant
in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us
here
. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body
JAMS
, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in
Annex 1
to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF
here
.
7. X's Audience
Our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your
parent or guardian to do so on your behalf
). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us
here
. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account. You can find additional resources for parents and teens
here
.
8. Changes To This Privacy Policy
The most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed.
If we do revise this Privacy Policy and make changes that are determined by us to be material, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to review the revised Privacy Policy before you continue to use X.
9. General
The X Privacy Policy is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English language version of the X Privacy Policy shall take precedence.

Note that some data elements can be both technical data and personal data (for example, IP address).
3. General information about how we process Users’ data
This section sets out how we process the data of all Users, including that of child End Users.
Our right to process Users’ data
SuperAwesome is a data controller (as defined in the GDPRs) which may process the personal data of Users in AwesomeAds Marketplace to support Customers operating safe Ad campaigns in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
We only process Users’ data when we have a legal basis to do so, in any of the following circumstances:
Where it is necessary for us to enter into, or perform a contract with, a Customer
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests, and the Users’ interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests
Where we need to comply with a legal obligation
Note that we may process a User’s data for more than one lawful basis, depending on the specific purpose for which we are using their data. For more information, contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
Legitimate interests
When we refer to our
legitimate interests
we mean the interest of our company (SuperAwesome) in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give Users the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.
We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact (both positive and negative) on Users and Users’ rights before we process their data for our legitimate interests. We do not process a User’s data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on the User (unless we have their consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
For further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities, contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
Special category data
AwesomeAds Marketplace does not process any special categories of personal data (as defined in the GDPRs) about Users, including for example information about race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, health, and genetic or biometric data.
Change of purpose
We will only process a User’s data for the purposes for which we originally intended, unless we reasonably consider that we need to process it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
For an explanation of how the processing of your data for a new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
User consent
We may process a User’s data without their knowledge or consent, in compliance with the rules in
Our right to process Users’ data
, where this is required or permitted by law.
4. What do we do with End Users’ data?
An
End User
is a person, typically a child, who uses a website or mobile application on which an Ad is delivered using AwesomeAds Marketplace.
How do we safeguard children’s privacy?
AwesomeAds Marketplace enables publishers to receive Ads secure in the knowledge that their users – including children – are protected from the risks associated with online profiling and interest-based targeting, and that they (the publishers) are serving Ads in compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K.
AwesomeAds Marketplace does this by deploying a proprietary process specifically designed to minimise our interaction with End User data, and to prevent such interaction by third parties involved in delivering Ads. This process entails the use of de-identified data when delivering Ads and monitoring their performance. For more information, see
How do we process End Users’ data?
All Ads delivered by AwesomeAds Marketplace carry the SuperAwesome ‘SAFE AD’ watermark:
The watermark signifies that delivery of the Ad involves no cookie-based targeting or behavioural tracking – in compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K – and each Ad creative has been reviewed for compliance with SuperAwesome’s advertising policies.
COPPA-compliant contextual targeting technology
AwesomeAds Marketplace’s proprietary contextual targeting technology is certified under the following COPPA Safe Harbor Programs approved by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC):
the kidSAFE Seal Program:
the ESRB Privacy Certified Program:
the CARU COPPA Safe Harbor Program:
The COPPA Safe Harbor Programs do not certify individual ads or ad campaigns.
The COPPA Safe Harbor Programs monitor and audit the AwesomeAds Marketplace contextual targeting technology for compliance with COPPA.
What End User data do we process?
The data we process from End Users is limited to specific technical data relating to the device on which the End User is viewing and engaging with an Ad served by AwesomeAds Marketplace. We refer to this data as
Device Data
.
Device Data
is defined as follows:
If an End User sees the Ad on a
mobile app
, their Device Data consists of the device’s user agent string, IP address and the app’s BundleID (e.g. “com.acme.bestgamever”) from the End User’s mobile device
If an End User sees the Ad on a
web browser
, their Device Data consists of the device’s user agent string, IP address and the site’s web domain address (e.g. “www.website.com”) where the Ad is shown
If an End User interacts with an Ad that includes augmented reality features, Device Data will include device type (e.g. phone or tablet) and browser information. We will ask for permission to access the device camera to enable a filter or overlay, but do not collect or share any images captured by the End User’s device.
How do we process End Users’ data?
The only End Users’ data we process is Device Data. In all cases we are strong advocates of data minimisation with regard to Device Data – even if some of that data is not personal data.
We process End Users’ Device Data as follows:
We generate a de-identified Marker
We observe the Device Data momentarily, and only in order to immediately transform it into a temporary custom identifier called a
Marker
. A Marker is a temporary, unique, one-way hashed value that cannot be reverse engineered to identify a particular individual.
Our Marker was designed specifically to enable AwesomeAds Marketplace to deliver Ads without SuperAwesome or any third party storing the personal data of End Users, which could be used to build online profiles for behavioural advertising, or other purposes that are not in compliance with data privacy laws regarding children.
By using a Marker, we do not need to retain or process Device Data in its original form.
To create the Marker:
We obfuscate the Device Data by injecting randomised characters into it and then run the resultant string through an algorithm which creates the Marker
The Device Data is not stored by SuperAwesome and is used only within the SDK
We discard the Marker when each Ad campaign has ended, or at month end, whichever occurs first
Third party Ad measurement
We may provide limited third-party access to Device Data for Ad measurement purposes, as explained in
How do we share Users’ data?
What is our legal basis for processing End Users’ data?
The following tables outline the purposes for which we may process End Users’ data, the legal bases we rely on to do so, and what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.

How long do we retain End Users’ Device Data?
We retain the following data elements indefinitely for reporting purposes:
language
device type
web domain
These elements cannot be used to identify an individual.
There is no permanent retention of End Users’ personal data within AwesomeAds Marketplace (or by SuperAwesome). An End Users’ Device Data is observed by us only momentarily, as further explained in
How do we process End Users’ data
? above.
5. What do we do with Authorised Users’ data?
An
Authorised User
is an individual who uses the Dashboard to manage advertising campaigns on behalf of our Customers.
What Authorised User data do we process?
To enable an Authorised User to access the Dashboard, we process their first name, last name, corporate email address, and Dashboard password.
When an Authorised User interacts with the Dashboard, we process technical data about their equipment, browsing actions and usage patterns on the Dashboard. We collect this data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies.
We process aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data of Authorised Users to monitor and improve the performance and features of the AwesomeAds Marketplace.
What is our legal basis for processing Authorised Users’ data?
This table outlines the purposes for which we may process certain types of Authorised Users’ data, the legal bases we rely on to do so, and what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.
When we process Authorised Users’ data
Type of data processed by AwesomeAds Marketplace

Lawful basis for processing data
When an Authorised User creates a Dashboard account
First name, last name, corporate email address and Dashboard password

To use data analytics to improve Customer relationships and Authorised User experiences
Necessary for our legitimate interests to operate, maintain and improve AwesomeAds Marketplace
How long do we retain Authorised Users’ data?
SuperAwesome retains personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements or protecting our rights.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Authorised Users’ data, we consider:
the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data
the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of the data
the purposes for which we process the data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means
applicable legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements
We only retain the data of Authorised Users for the life of the Customer relationship with SuperAwesome or until deletion is requested either by the Customer or the Authorised User, or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.
We may retain an Authorised User’s data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with the Customer or the Authorised User.
Marketing
We do not normally send marketing materials to Authorised Users unless they have opted in to receive marketing from SuperAwesome through other channels. From time to time, Authorised Users receive service information updates via the Dashboard.
Cookies
We use Google Analytics on the Dashboard. Google Analytics places a cookie on Authorised Users’ devices. As an Authorised User, you can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.
If you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of the Dashboard may become inaccessible or not function properly.
6. What do we do with general enquiry and subscribers’ data?
When someone enquires about our products or services, subscribes to our service or publications, or gives us feedback, we process the personal data which they have provided (e.g. name and email address) to respond to them.
7. How do we share Users’ data?
Sharing Users’ data with third-party providers
SuperAwesome uses a small number of third-party service providers to help us provide the AwesomeAds Marketplace to Users. Some of these providers may process Users’ data on our behalf.
For example:
We use a third party to host AwesomeAds Marketplace
We use third party tools to help us better understand how Customers and Authorised Users navigate across the Dashboard
We use service providers to support our internal operations, and who may process Device Data to measure the effectiveness of an Ad. For example, to support fraud detection (by determining invalid traffic such as bots), verification of impressions, and measuring how much of an Ad was ‘viewable’
We enter into contractual arrangements with our service providers to ensure that they are only processing your data in a lawful manner and strictly for the foregoing purposes. It may not be used or shared for any other purposes, including for behavioural advertising or to amass a profile on a User.
We maintain a current list of providers
here.
To learn more about how our third-party data processors use Users’ data, please refer to their privacy policies.
Sharing Users’ data within SuperAwesome
We may share a User’s data within the SuperAwesome group of companies and other third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, the new owners may process a User’s data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.
Sharing Users’ data for other reasons
We may disclose a User’s data for any of the following reasons:
in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law
if doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process
to permit us to pursue available remedies, including commencing or responding to any claims
to enforce the terms and conditions of AwesomeAds Marketplace
to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SuperAwesome or the public
to prevent other illegal activity
for risk management purposes
8. How do we transfer Users’ data internationally?
We may transfer Users’ data in the following ways:
We share Users’ data within the SuperAwesome group of companies. This involves transferring Users’ data outside the UK and EEA.
Some of our third-party data processors are based outside the UK and EEA so their processing of Users’ data may involve a transfer of Users’ data outside the UK and EEA.
Whenever we authorise a transfer of Users’ data outside of the UK and EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using specific contracting frameworks approved by the UK Government and European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK and EEA. If you require further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring Users’ data outside of the UK or EEA, please contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
9. How do we secure Users’ data?
SuperAwesome values your trust and strives to maintain adequate security measures for all areas of our business and our services. Because AwesomeAds Marketplace is a service that operates digitally, SuperAwesome is continuously reviewing and improving its security measures to prevent data breaches and security incidents.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent Users’ data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
We limit access to Users’ data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties strictly on a “need to know” basis. They only process Users’ data on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Third party websites, services and apps
Some of the correspondence Authorised Users receive from us may contain links to third party websites, online services or mobile applications that are not affiliated with or operated by us, including those of the Customers who use AwesomeAds Marketplace. While SuperAwesome tries to link only to websites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible and accept no liability for the content, security or privacy practices of those other websites.
To find out how your personal data may be used by third party websites, refer to the privacy and cookie policies displayed on those websites.
10. Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your
personal data
. For example, you may have rights to:
Review/access/delete/restrict the collection
of your child’s personal data. Under COPPA, a parent has certain rights over how we handle the personal data of an End User who is their child. This includes the right for a parent to review, access, or delete the personal data that has been collected by us from that End User, and to refuse at any time to permit the collection from that End User of such personal data.
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances, such as where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You may also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons of which you will be notified, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You may also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy
where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent as the legal basis upon which to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
If you are a California resident, please refer to the California residents section below for more information on your legal rights.
No fee usually required
You do not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Do Not Track disclosure
Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (
DNT
) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, AwesomeAds Marketplace does not support and does not act on DNT signal headers that we may receive.
11. Location-specific privacy rules
Depending on where you are resident, specific privacy rules apply:
UK and EEA
If you are concerned that we have not complied with your legal rights or applicable privacy laws, you may contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (www.ico.gov.uk) which is the regulator responsible for data protection in the United Kingdom, where SuperAwesome Trading Limited is registered (Registration number Z8630714). If you are located in the EEA, you may contact your local data protection authority. You can find contact details

SuperAwesome is a Service Provider for its Customers in connection with the provision of the Dashboard. SuperAwesome does not retain, use, or disclose Personal Information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the services specified in its agreement with Customers, as set out in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA.

the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected
the purposes for which the information was collected or sold

Where possible, we will provide this information to you in a readily usable format that allows transmission to another entity.
To submit a request, you or an authorized agent may email us at
privacy@superawesome.com
. We will confirm your request, and may ask for additional information as needed to verify your identity or authority.
Right to delete
Because SuperAwesome is a Service Provider, we may not be able to respond directly to your request. In this case, we will direct you to contact the applicable third party for additional information.

privacy@superawesome.com
.
Verification
Requests for access to or deletion of Personal Information are subject to our ability to reasonably verify your identity considering the information requested and pursuant to relevant CCPA requirements, limitations, and regulations. If we need additional information to verify your identity, we will contact you to request that information.
Right to be free from discrimination
We will not discriminate against you because you have chosen to exercise your rights, including, for example, by denying you access to our online services or charging you different rates or prices for the same online services, unless that difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your data.
Exercising your rights
To submit a request or to otherwise contact us for more information about how to exercise your rights, please follow the instructions above. If you would like to designate an authorised agent to make a request on your behalf, please be sure the agent is able to:
demonstrate you have provided written permission for the agent to submit the request on your behalf
provide proof of their own identity
If the agent does not satisfy both these requirements, we will deny the request.
California residents’ “Shine the Light” law
We do not share your Personal Information with any unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes.

9. Analytical tools
9.1. Tracking tools
The tracking measures listed below and used by us are implemented based on Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, point (f) of the GDPR. The tracking measures used are intended to ensure needs-based design and continuous optimization of our website or our mobile apps. We also use tracking measures to record statistics about the use of our website or mobile apps and analyze them in order to optimize our offer for you. These interests are legitimate as defined by the regulation cited above. The particular data processing aims and data categories can be found in the corresponding tracking tools.
9.1.1. Google Analytics
For purposes of needs-based design and continuous optimization of our pages, we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (
https://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/
) (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter “
Google
“). Pseudonymized use profiles are generated and cookies (see number 4) are used in this context. The information about your use of our website or our mobile apps generated by the cookie, such as
Browser type/version,
Operating system used,
Referrer URL (previously visited page),
Host name of accessing computer (IP address),
Time of server query, is sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The information is used to analyze the use of our website or our mobile apps, to compile reports about website activities, and to perform other services related to website use and Internet use for purposes of market research and needs-based design of our website or our mobile apps. This information may also be sent to third parties if required by law or if third parties are processing this data on a contract basis. Under no circumstances will your IP address be linked to other Google data. IP addresses are anonymized to make association impossible (IP masking).
You can prevent cookies from being installed by disabling the corresponding setting in your browser software; however, we advise that in this case the full functionally of our website may not be able to be used. You can also prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie about your use of our website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
). As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile end devices, you can also prevent collection by Google Analytics by clicking on

9.1.2. Google Adwords conversion
We also use Google conversion tracking to record statistics about the use of our website or our mobile apps and analyze them in order to optimize our website or our mobile apps for you. Google Adwords places a cookie (see number 8) on your computer if you arrived at our website through a Google ad on our website or our mobile apps. These cookies expire after 30 days and do not act as personal identification. If the user visits certain pages on the website or mobile apps of the Adwords customer and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can detect that the user clicked on the ad and was forwarded to this page. Data privacy authorities require a contract data processing agreement to be concluded for lawful use of Google Analytics. Google offers a template at
http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.pdf
. Every Adwords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies therefore cannot be traced through the websites or mobile apps of Adwords customers. The information obtained using conversion cookies helps create conversion statistics for Adwords customers that have chosen to use conversation tracking. Adwords customers learn the total number of users who have clicked on their ad and been forwarded to a website or mobile app that has a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that could personally identify users. If you don’t want to participate in tracking, you can also refuse placement of a cookie required for this, for example using a browser setting that deactivates automatic placement of cookies in general. You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser so that cookies from the domain “www.googleadservices.com” are blocked.

10. Social Media Plug-Ins
10.1. On the basis of Art. 6 (1), sentence 1, point (f) of the GDPR, we place social media plug-ins of the social networks Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram on our website or our mobile apps to raise our company’s profile through them. The advertising purpose behind this is considered a legitimate interest as defined by the GDPR. Responsibility for operation that complies with data privacy must be guaranteed by the respective providers. We incorporate these plug-ins using the so-called two-click method to protect users of our website or our mobile apps as well as we can.
10.1.1. Facebook
Our website or our mobile apps use Facebook social media plug-ins to personalize use. We use the “LIKE” or “SHARE” button to do this. This is an offer provided by Facebook. If you access a page of our website or our mobile apps that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook’s servers. Facebook sends the content of the plug-in directly to your browser, which incorporates it into our website or our mobile apps. The incorporation of the plug-ins gives Facebook the information that your browser has accessed the relevant page of our website or our mobile apps even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not logged into Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is sent by your browser directly to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can directly associate the visit to our website or our mobile apps with your Facebook account. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the “LIKE” or “SHARE” button, the corresponding information is also sent directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information is further published on Facebook and shown to your Facebook friends. Facebook may use this information for purposes of advertisement, market research, and needs-based design of Facebook pages. Facebook generates use, interest, and relationship profiles for this purpose, e.g. to analyze your use of our website or our mobile apps in relation to the advertisements displayed to you on Facebook, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website or our mobile apps, and to perform other services related to the use of Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to associate the data collected through our website or our mobile apps with your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before your visit to our website or our mobile apps. Please find the purpose and scope of the data collection and further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as your rights in this regard and possible settings for protecting your privacy in Facebook’s data privacy policy (
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/
).
10.1.2. Twitter
Plug-ins of the news and social network Twitter Inc. (Twitter) are integrated into our website or our mobile apps. You can recognize the Twitter plug-ins (tweet button) by the Twitter logo on our website or our mobile apps. You can find an overview of tweet buttons here (
https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons
). If you access a page of our website or our mobile apps that contains such a plug-in, a direct connection is created between your browser and the Twitter server. Twitter thereby receives the information that you have visited our website or our mobile apps with your IP address. If you click the Twitter “tweet button” while you are logged into your Twitter account, you can link to the content of our websites on your Twitter profile. This allows Twitter to associate the visit to our website or our mobile apps with your user account. We advise that, as the provider of our website or our mobile apps, we have no awareness of the content of the transmitted data or the use thereof by Twitter. If you do not want Twitter to be able to associate the visit to our website or our mobile apps, please log out of your Twitter user account. You can find further information about this in Twitter’s privacy policy (
https://twitter.com/privacy
).
10.1.3. Instagram
Our website or our mobile apps also use so-called social plug-ins (“plug-ins”) of Instagram that are operated by Instagram 3 LLC., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (“
Instagram
“). The plug-ins are identified by an Instagram logo, for example in the form of an “Instagram camera.” If you access a page of our website or our mobile apps that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to Instagram’s servers. Instagram sends the content of the plug-in directly to your browser, which incorporates it into the page. This incorporation gives Instagram the information that your browser has accessed the relevant page of our website or our mobile apps even if you do not have an Instagram account or are not logged into Instagram. This information (including your IP address) is sent by your browser directly to an Instagram server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged into Instagram, Instagram can directly associate the visit to our website or our mobile apps with your Instagram account. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the “Instagram” button, this information is also sent directly to an Instagram server and stored there. The information is also published on your Instagram account and displayed to your contacts there. If you do not want Instagram to associate the data collected through our website directly with your Instagram account, you must log out of Instagram before your visit to our website or our mobile apps. You can find further information about this in Instagram’s privacy policy (
https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388
).
11. YOUTUBE
11.1. In order to incorporate videos, our website uses the provider YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA, represented by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Normally, your IP address is sent to YouTube and cookies are installed on your computer as soon as you access a page with embedded videos. However, we have incorporated our YouTube videos using the enhanced data privacy mode (in this case, YouTube still contacts Google’s Double Click service, but according to Google’s privacy policy no personal data is analyzed). As a result, YouTube does not store more information about visitors unless you view the videos. If you click the video, your IP address is sent to YouTube and YouTube learns that you have viewed the video. If you are logged in to YouTube, this information is associated with your user account (you can prevent this by logging out of YouTube before accessing the video).
We have no knowledge of and no influence on potential further collection or use of your data by YouTube. You can find more detailed information in YouTube’s privacy policy under
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de&gl=de
