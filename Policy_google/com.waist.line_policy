Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains and gives information regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you utilize Waistline and the choices you have associated with that data. By utilizing the software, you accept the terms and conditions of this Policy. This Policy applies to this software and the developer is not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any third-party app not operated by the developer to which this software links or that links to this software.
Information Collection and Use
Waistline only requires the availability of an internet connection when the barcode of a product is scanned, when searching for a product online, or when uploading a product to the Open Food Facts database. During a scan or a search, the only information sent to Open Food Facts or the USDA is the product barcode or the search terms entered.
For the software to function efficiently camera and storage permissions are required. These are needed to be able to scan barcodes, upload product images, and to import and export data.
Types of Data Collected
Personal Data
No personal data is collected while utilizing the software.
Usage Data
Usage data is collected only when interacting with the Open Food Facts or USDA databases.
Security of Data
The security of your data is important but no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, therefore the developer doesn't guarantee its absolute security.
Service Providers
Waistline requires third-party databases (Open Food Facts and USDA) to facilitate some of its functionality.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
This privacy policy may be updated from time to time as the functionalities of the software are further developed and improved and may contain disparities that will nullify this current policy.
