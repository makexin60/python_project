Contact us with regards our privacy policy
The Read with Phonics� service, accessible through the Read with Phonics Website and App, is designed for use by children between 3 and 8 years old. Because the protection of children and personal data is extremely important to us, the Read with Phonics service can only be setup and subscribed to by the parent or legal guardian of the child using the Read with Phonics service, or by a teacher in limited circumstances.
This policy sets out the limited circumstances in which we process the personal data of children using the Read with Phonics Website and App and the personal data of any parent, legal guardian or teacher.
For parents and legal guardians
By registering to use the Read with Phonics service, you provide your consent for us to use your data as set out in this privacy policy.
By registering, setting up or allowing your children to use the Read with Phonics service, you give consent on behalf of your children for us to use their data as set out in this privacy policy.
For teachers
If you are a teacher setting up the Read with Phonics service for use in your classroom, you should only do this where you have obtained consent for the children in your class to use the Read with Phonics service from their parents.
We need you to obtain this consent because young children are unable to give consent for themselves.
By registering, setting up or allowing the children in your class or school to use the Read with Phonics service, you confirm that you have obtained the consents that you need from the parents/legal guardians for their child to use the Read with Phonics service, and for us to use their children's data as set out in this privacy policy.
By registering with Read with Phonics service, you also consent to us using your data as set out in this privacy policy.
The Read with Phonics Five Principles
We will never ask you for more personal information than we need.
We may share aggregated statistical information with third parties. However, we will not share any personal information that identifies you to third parties.
We will make sure the data you have provided to us is kept secure.
We will not advertise to your children.
There will be no hidden costs.
What Information do we collect about you, and why?
When you create a Read with Phonics account
We will ask you, as the teacher, parent or legal guardian, to provide your first and last name, as well as your email address. We ask for this in order to provide you with the Read with Phonics service. We also need to collect your email address to contact you where you have asked us to send you Read with Phonics progress reports.
We will also ask you to provide a "username" for each child using the Read with Phonics service. You may decide to use each child's first name as the username, or their initials. We will never ask you to provide the full name of each child using the Read with Phonics service, and we ask for a unique username to be provided for each child for the sole purpose of providing an easy way for you to monitor each child's progress.
When you use the Read with Phonics App or Website
When you use the Read with Phonics service, we collect anonymous information about how the Read with Phonics service is being used, such as the number of attempts to pass a particular level, information relating to the time spent on the Read with Phonics service, as well as how quickly each level is being completed. We collect this information to improve the service we provide to you (such as by adjusting the difficulty or content of particular levels), to report on progress to you, and to help us contribute to industry wide discussions around improving the education of children.
We will also collect limited, anonymous information about your computer or the device you are accessing the Read with Phonics service from, in order to ensure the Read with Phonics service is presented in the most effective way for you and your computer or device. For example, we are able to detect whether you are accessing the Read with Phonics Website via a mobile phone, in which case we may provide you with the mobile version of our Website.
We will also collect and process data about you when you fill in forms on our Website or App, when you complete surveys or feedback forms that we use for research purposes or if you contact us.
How we market to you
We make the commitment that we do not market or advertise to children. However, where and only where requested by you, we will send you and keep you updated with:
information by email or mail about existing and new goods, services, promotions and special offers from us; and
information by e-mail or mail about related goods or services of selected third parties that may be of interest to you.
If you agree to us providing you with this marketing information, you can always opt-out at a later date, by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link sent in our email messages and newsletters, or by sending an email to

writing "unsubscribe" in the subject heading.
Where do we store your personal data?
The personal information that we collect from you will be stored by us on servers in the European Economic Area and will not be processed or transferred by us outside the European Economic Area.
How do we protect your personal data?
We try to take all reasonable steps to protect your personal data. Where possible, we use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer technology to allow for the encryption of information such as your name, address and credit card number.
Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but we cannot guarantee the security of your data whilst it is transmitted to us. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
