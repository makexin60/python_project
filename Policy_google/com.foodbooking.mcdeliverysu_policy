4. WHICH CATEGORIES AND SPECIFIC PIECES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE PROCESS?
Depending on how you use the Restaurant Services and whether you are a Restaurant Client, Partner, or Restaurant Holder when interacting with the Platform or FoodBooking, the personal information Oracle processes may include:
Contact information:
name, email address, phone number, address;
Order information:
transactional details based on your orders, financial details, and payment methods, delivery address(es), and your favorite Restaurants in your geographic location;
Restaurant Holder and Partner information:
information provided when Restaurant Holders and Partners create a Restaurant or Partner account with the Restaurant Services, username and password;

If you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to use the Restaurant Services. For example, if you do not provide your name and contact details, you will not be able to order food via the FoodBooking app.
5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We may use your personal information for the following business purposes:
to centrally store and manage Restaurant Clients’ personal information in connection with the Restaurant Services;
to provide the functionality of the FoodBooking mobile app to Restaurant Clients;
to generate aggregated analytics for marketing messages sent and websites created by Restaurants via the Platform;
to provide, deliver, and manage the requested functionality of the Restaurant Services and the Restaurant Order-Taking App;
to communicate and respond to requests and inquiries to Oracle, including to provide support via the support chat functionality or email;
to administer the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program;
to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of the Restaurant Services;
to manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems; and
to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
To centrally store and manage Restaurant Clients’ personal information in connection with the Restaurant Services.
When Restaurant Clients order food via the FoodBooking app or the Restaurant’s website or app, their personal information is stored and managed centrally on the Oracle Restaurants eStore Online Ordering system. The information provided by a Restaurant Client when submitting an order is collected specifically for a Restaurant and held by Oracle in order to provide the Restaurant Services.
To provide the functionality of the FoodBooking mobile app to Restaurant Clients.
When Restaurant Clients download and use the FoodBooking mobile app, Restaurant Clients can locate Restaurants that use the Platform, view the menus of these Restaurants, and place orders with them.
To generate aggregated analytics for marketing messages sent and websites created by Restaurants via the Platform.
Restaurant Holders can use the Platform to generate aggregated analytics about the marketing messages they sent, and the websites they created, via the Platform. Oracle uses personal information to generate aggregated analytics on behalf of, and at the direction of, a Restaurant or Restaurant Holder. For example, aggregated information may include the percentage of recipients that open a marketing message without identifying the specific Restaurant Client or the number of new or repeat Restaurant Clients who visit the Restaurant website.
To provide, deliver, and manage the requested functionality of the Restaurant Services and the Restaurant Order-Taking App.
When Restaurant Holders and Partners choose to register with us, we process personal information provided by them so that we can create an Oracle Restaurants eStore Online Ordering account for them. In addition, Restaurant Holders can download and use the Restaurant Order-Taking App to receive orders that are placed with their Restaurant via the Platform. Oracle processes contact and device information to provide this functionality.
To communicate and respond to requests and inquiries to Oracle, including to provide support via the support chat functionality or email.
Oracle may process personal information when individuals have questions about the Restaurant Services or other support questions and reach out to us via the support chat functionality or via email. The support chat functionality is intended only for Restaurant Holders and Partners; Restaurant Clients that have questions about their orders should contact the relevant Restaurant directly.
To administer the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program.
We process Partners’ and Restaurant Holders’ personal information when a Partner enrolls a Restaurant Holder with us, and when we sign up this Restaurant Holder to the Platform.
To analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of the Restaurant Services.
We may process aggregated personal information in order to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services, including for quality assurance and training purposes.
To manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems.
We collect and use personal information for our own security and operations management to help keep the Restaurant Services, and related data and systems of Restaurant Clients, Restaurant Holders, Partners, and Oracle under our control, secure. We may also collect usage and systems operations data from Oracle websites or mobile apps to investigate and prevent cyber-attacks, malicious activity, or potential fraud, and to detect bots.
To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
In some cases, we may collect and use personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend against legal claims. We may also process personal information in the operation of our business. For example, to conduct audits and investigations, for finance and accounting, archiving and insurance purposes.
6. WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?
For personal information collected about you in the EU/EEA, the UK and other relevant jurisdictions, our legal basis for processing is the following:
The legal basis for processing individuals’ personal information to administer and manage personal information to provide the requested Restaurant Services or related support services is contractual necessity.
The legal basis for processing Restaurant Clients’ personal information to compile aggregated statistics on marketing campaign or website performance is Oracle’s legitimate interest to better understand and improve the services it provides to its customers. The Restaurant is responsible for collecting any required consent from Restaurant Clients prior to sending marketing messages per the Oracle Restaurants eStore Master Agreement.
The legal basis for administrating the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program is our legitimate interest in acquiring new Restaurant Holders for the Platform via the Partner Program and the necessity of this processing to take (pre)contractual measures to sign up the new Restaurant Holders.
The legal basis for analyzing, developing, improving, and optimizing our sites, facilities, products, and services, and to maintain the security of our sites, networks and systems is our legitimate interest to provide functional and secure services.
In some cases, processing may be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Oracle is subject, such as to process an opt-out request.
7. FOR WHAT PERIOD DO WE RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Oracle maintains personal information for the following retention periods:
We retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
For as long as necessary for Oracle to provide the Restaurant Services;
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
8. WHEN AND HOW CAN WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Sharing within Oracle
As a global organization, information about you may be shared globally throughout Oracle’s worldwide organization. See the list of
Oracle entities
. Please select a region and country to view the registered address and contact details of the Oracle entity or entities located in each country.
Oracle employees are authorized to access personal information only to the extent necessary to serve the applicable purpose(s) and to perform their job functions.
Disclosing personal information to third parties
We may disclose personal information with the following third parties for a business purpose:
Third-party service providers (for example, credit card and payment processing services, order fulfilment, analytics, event/campaign management, meeting scheduling, website management, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service and support, e-mail delivery, auditing, and other similar service providers) in order for those service providers to perform business functions on behalf of Oracle;
Relevant third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings);
As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to government requests, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, for national security and/or law enforcement purposes.
When third parties are given access to personal information, we will take appropriate contractual, technical and organizational measures designed to ensure that personal information is processed only to the extent that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with applicable law.
9. HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION HANDLED GLOBALLY?
Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries and personal information is processed globally. If personal information is transferred to an Oracle recipient in a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal information, Oracle will take measures designed to adequately protect information about you.
Additional information regarding the EEA, Switzerland and the UK: For transfers from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK to countries not considered adequate under applicable data protection laws, we have put in place adequate data transfer measures, such as standard contractual clauses to protect your personal information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting us using the contact details set out in
Section 12

to communicate and respond to requests and inquiries to Oracle, including to provide support via the support chat functionality or email;
to administer the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program;
to analyze, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of the Restaurant Services;
to manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems; and
to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
To centrally store and manage Restaurant Clients’ personal information in connection with the Restaurant Services.
When Restaurant Clients order food via the FoodBooking app or the Restaurant’s website or app, their personal information is stored and managed centrally on the Oracle Restaurants eStore Online Ordering system. The information provided by a Restaurant Client when submitting an order is collected specifically for a Restaurant and held by Oracle in order to provide the Restaurant Services.
To provide the functionality of the FoodBooking mobile app to Restaurant Clients.
When Restaurant Clients download and use the FoodBooking mobile app, Restaurant Clients can locate Restaurants that use the Platform, view the menus of these Restaurants, and place orders with them.
To generate aggregated analytics for marketing messages sent and websites created by Restaurants via the Platform.
Restaurant Holders can use the Platform to generate aggregated analytics about the marketing messages they sent, and the websites they created, via the Platform. Oracle uses personal information to generate aggregated analytics on behalf of, and at the direction of, a Restaurant or Restaurant Holder. For example, aggregated information may include the percentage of recipients that open a marketing message without identifying the specific Restaurant Client or the number of new or repeat Restaurant Clients who visit the Restaurant website.
To provide, deliver, and manage the requested functionality of the Restaurant Services and the Restaurant Order-Taking App.
When Restaurant Holders and Partners choose to register with us, we process personal information provided by them so that we can create an Oracle Restaurants eStore Online Ordering account for them. In addition, Restaurant Holders can download and use the Restaurant Order-Taking App to receive orders that are placed with their Restaurant via the Platform. Oracle processes contact and device information to provide this functionality.
To communicate and respond to requests and inquiries to Oracle, including to provide support via the support chat functionality or email.
Oracle may process personal information when individuals have questions about the Restaurant Services or other support questions and reach out to us via the support chat functionality or via email. The support chat functionality is intended only for Restaurant Holders and Partners; Restaurant Clients that have questions about their orders should contact the relevant Restaurant directly.
To administer the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program.
We process Partners’ and Restaurant Holders’ personal information when a Partner enrolls a Restaurant Holder with us, and when we sign up this Restaurant Holder to the Platform.
To analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of the Restaurant Services.
We may process aggregated personal information in order to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services, including for quality assurance and training purposes.
To manage the security and operation of our sites, facilities, and networks and systems.
We collect and use personal information for our own security and operations management to help keep the Restaurant Services, and related data and systems of Restaurant Clients, Restaurant Holders, Partners, and Oracle under our control, secure. We may also collect usage and systems operations data from Oracle websites or mobile apps to investigate and prevent cyber-attacks, malicious activity, or potential fraud, and to detect bots.
To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.
In some cases, we may collect and use personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend against legal claims. We may also process personal information in the operation of our business. For example, to conduct audits and investigations, for finance and accounting, archiving and insurance purposes.
6. WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?
For personal information collected about you in the EU/EEA, the UK and other relevant jurisdictions, our legal basis for processing is the following:
The legal basis for processing individuals’ personal information to administer and manage personal information to provide the requested Restaurant Services or related support services is contractual necessity.
The legal basis for processing Restaurant Clients’ personal information to compile aggregated statistics on marketing campaign or website performance is Oracle’s legitimate interest to better understand and improve the services it provides to its customers. The Restaurant is responsible for collecting any required consent from Restaurant Clients prior to sending marketing messages per the Oracle Restaurants eStore Master Agreement.
The legal basis for administrating the Oracle Restaurants eStore Partner Program is our legitimate interest in acquiring new Restaurant Holders for the Platform via the Partner Program and the necessity of this processing to take (pre)contractual measures to sign up the new Restaurant Holders.
The legal basis for analyzing, developing, improving, and optimizing our sites, facilities, products, and services, and to maintain the security of our sites, networks and systems is our legitimate interest to provide functional and secure services.
In some cases, processing may be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Oracle is subject, such as to process an opt-out request.
7. FOR WHAT PERIOD DO WE RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Oracle maintains personal information for the following retention periods:
We retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
For as long as necessary for Oracle to provide the Restaurant Services;
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
8. WHEN AND HOW CAN WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Relevant third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings);
As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to government requests, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, for national security and/or law enforcement purposes.
When third parties are given access to personal information, we will take appropriate contractual, technical and organizational measures designed to ensure that personal information is processed only to the extent that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with applicable law.

How We Collect, Disclose, and Use Personal Data
Is Stripe acting as a data controller or a data processor?
The answer is both.
The “data controller” is the entity which determines the purposes and means of the data processing taking place. The “data processor” is an entity acting on behalf and under the instructions of a controller in processing personal data.
Stripe is a data controller when it determines the purposes and means of the processing taking place. These data processing activities include (1) providing the Stripe products and services, (2) monitoring, preventing and detecting fraudulent payment transactions and other fraudulent activity on the Stripe platform, (3) complying with legal or regulatory obligations applicable to the financial sector to which Stripe is subject, and (4) analyzing, developing and improving Stripe’s products and services. Please see this
Privacy Center article
for more information on Stripe’s controller activities.
Stripe is a data processor where it is facilitating payment transactions on behalf of and at the direction of a Business User. Our Business Users direct us to take payment from cardholders / End Customers.
Stripe is considered a processor when directed to process payments (i.e., Stripe receives instructions about whom to pay, how much to pay, when to pay).
As a platform provider, we need to ensure consistency across our platform, and that includes consistency with respect to the commitments that we give about how we operate our platform. We contract with all of our Business Users (including some of the world’s largest companies) on this basis.
Which Stripe entities are involved?
For most of our services, either Stripe, Inc., the US parent company operating under US law, or Stripe Payments Europe, Limited (“SPEL”), an Irish company operating under Irish law, is the data controller responsible for Personal Data collected and processed in relation to Stripe Services.
The Stripe entity responsible for your data will depend on your location, the product or service you use with us and whether Stripe is acting as a controller and/or data processor.
If you are located outside of the Americas (e.g., European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom, countries located in Asia Pacific (“APAC”)), SPEL is the primary entity responsible for the processing of your personal data. Some of the payment processing services offered by Stripe are services that may be only provided for by an authorised payment services provider or electronic money institution. In this case, SPEL and the Stripe local regulated entity (defined as those who are licensed, authorized or registered by a Local Regulatory Authority) will act as joint controllers of your Personal Data.
Please see our table below for more information on who is your controller in these jurisdictions:

Stripe affiliates also provide local support services in certain countries where Stripe operates. These entities act as data processors on behalf of Stripe, Inc. or SPEL, depending on the jurisdiction. You will find the most up-to-date list of the Stripe affiliates on this
page
.
For certain products, Stripe may act as an independent controller (e.g. Stripe Capital), a data processor or both (e.g. Stripe Identity). Please see the Privacy Center article for each specific product for more information.
What are your data controller activities?
Providing the Stripe products and services to Business Users and End Users, including determining the third parties (banks and payment method providers) to be utilized;
Monitoring, preventing and detecting fraudulent payment transactions and other fraudulent activity on the Stripe platform;
Complying with legal or regulatory obligations applicable to the financial sector to which Stripe is subject, including applicable anti-money laundering screening and compliance with know-your-customer obligations; and
Analyzing, developing and improving Stripe’s products and services.
How does Stripe use personal data to improve its products and services?
Stripe collects data, including personal data, while providing services to its users.  Stripe uses some of the data it collects to improve its products and services, including by training the models it employs for fraud and loss prevention and to analyze the performance of Stripe’s products as permitted by applicable law and agreements.
Personal data is required to train Stripe’s fraud and loss prevention models, including those employed by Stripe Radar and Stripe Identity.  These products rely in part on their ability to recognize certain characteristics that help determine whether a transaction is fraudulent or unlikely to complete.  For example, they compare Personal Data presented in a specific transaction to Personal Data collected in the past to identify when a fraudster is attempting to perpetrate fraud, including to impersonate a Stripe User or their End Customers.
In addition to using Personal Data to train its fraud and loss prevention models, Stripe also uses transaction data to assess the functioning of its current products and proposed product improvements.  For instance, Stripe uses data collected by its java script library stripe.js to assess the performance of the checkout surfaces it provides to Business Users, and payment authorization data to evaluate ways to improve authorization rates for Business Users.
Stripe uses Personal Data, such as IP address, to identify which pages and features a user interacted with during a checkout session, so that it can assess the effect different features have on the outcome of a checkout session.
Stripe uses pseudonymized or aggregated transaction data for these purposes in certain circumstances.  When Stripe communicates the results of its product performance analytics to Business Users or for advertising purposes, it does so only in aggregated or de-identified form that does not permit third-parties outside of Stripe to associate that data with any particular End Customers.
You should consult your legal counsel regarding how best to disclose Stripe’s data usage to your customers.  But, here is a paragraph you could add to your privacy policy if it doesn’t already include such a disclosure:
We use Stripe for payments, analytics, and other business services.  Stripe may collect personal data including via cookies and similar technologies.  The personal data Stripe collects may include transactional data and identifying information about devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection, loss prevention, authentication, and analytics related to the performance of its services.  You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at
https://stripe.com/privacy
.
How does Stripe use personal data to train machine learning models?
We train machine learning models that we deploy for a number of purposes, including to prevent fraud and other harm to Stripe, Users, and others, increase authorization rates and revenue realization for Business Users, provide and improve User experience on other Services, and identify when Business Users may benefit from services they are not currently using.
Preventing Fraud
We train machine learning models to prevent fraud in a number of ways, using different kinds of data appropriate to the kinds of fraud we are trying to prevent.  These fraud prevention models include:
Our transaction fraud models which power Stripe Radar and are trained to recognize transaction fraud, including card testing and card cashing.  We train such models using data related to activity that individuals and businesses have conducted on our Services. We also use information from third party and publicly available sources including those related to data compromises and fraud attacks.  The training data may include payments transaction data, such as names, addresses, location based on IP addresses, and payment method information,
advanced fraud
detection data, Financial Connections data, and signals from third party providers regarding whether consumer transaction details and device information may have been compromised, fabricated, or associated with fraud.  Using such details enables our models to recognize patterns in the information we receive at the time of a transaction that may indicate fraud attacks.
Our authorization fraud models which we use to provide advanced fraud tools to Stripe Issuing users.  We train these models using data related to activity conducted using cards issued through the Stripe Issuing program.  This training data may include transaction data, accountholder data, authorized user data, and merchant information, such as names, email addresses, card details, addresses, and histories of authorizations, declines, and disputes.  Based on these features, our models evaluate the circumstances surrounding a transaction presented for authorization on a Stripe Issuing card to score the risk that a given transaction is attempted without authorization.  Issuing users can leverage these scores to determine whether to block or allow transactions attempted on cards issued for them.
Business User risk models that identify when prospective Business Users may pose a heightened risk of fraud and other losses to Stripe, Users, and other participants in the financial ecosystem.  We train these models using risk signals related to Business User and Representative details, such as names, email addresses, dates of birth, physical addresses, bank account information, and device details, business information, such as industry information and website content, patterns of activity on our Services, including payments, disputes, and past fraud actions,
advanced fraud
signals collected when a Business User or Representative accesses our sites, and signals indicating that Business User or Representative details may be compromised, fabricated, or associated with fraud.  We collect this data from our Services and publicly available and third-party sources.  Training on such data allows our models to recognize usage patterns by Business Users that can be indicative of potential fraud and other behavior that may cause losses.
Increasing Authorization and Revenue Realization
We train machine learning models to increase authorization rates and revenue realization for Business Users who use our payments products.  Models we train for these purposes include:
Models that power Stripe Billing’s Smart Retries feature.  This feature uses machine learning to identify the best time to re-attempt a failed subscription payment.  We train the Smart Retries models on data from past transactions on Stripe to identify the times at which transactions associated with a customer’s card details, name, email address, IP address, billing address, and shipping address have been successful.  This model may be trained on features indicating the time and outcome of past transactions, card features, such as address, bin, and card type, user device features, such as IP address and user agent, and transaction features, such as the amount, subscription type and history, and product description.  We also use location based on IP address as calculated by third-party service providers.   Based on this information, Smart Retries recommends to users when may be the best time to make another attempt at processing a failed subscription payment.
Models that power Stripe Payments’s Adaptive Acceptance feature.  We use these models to determine whether to reattempt charges that a card network or issuing bank rejected on the first attempt and to automatically select the optimal protocol optimization and authentication pathway for the transaction.  We train the models using data from past transactions on Stripe, including features related to the history of authorizations and declines we have observed for the card, customer, or merchant involved in the transaction, transaction features such as the merchant, amount of the charge, and the reason it was declined, and card features such as the bin, issuer, and expiry date.  Based on these features, the models calculate the probability that a charge will be successful if submitted at different times and according to different protocols. We use this probability of authorization to determine how to submit the charge to maximize profit for Stripe and its Users.
Providing Other Services
We train machine learning models to power other Services such as:
Stripe Identity, which uses machine learning models to match verification subjects with their photo ID documents.  These models compare biometric features in the selfies with those in the documents and spot features common to fraudulent verification attempts, such as images where the subject’s face is obscured by a mask or the document has been modified or does not match a known format.  We train Identity’s models using images from verification subjects who have consented to our using their data to improve Stripe Identity.
Instant Bank Payments, which uses machine learning models to evaluate the risk that someone is attempting to misuse the service by conducting a transaction using a bank account they are not authorized to use or an account with insufficient funds.  End Users who sign up for Instant Bank Payments agree to provide us with details from their bank accounts, such as ownership information, transaction history, and balance details, to determine whether to authorize their transactions and train our models to recognize when banks are likely to reject future transactions attempted through the Instant Bank Payments Service.
Identifying Services for Users
We also train models to recognize Business Users that are good candidates to use additional Stripe services, such as Stripe Capital in the US.  We may train these models using information related to a Business User’s activity on the Stripe platform and, when the user provides them to us, bank account and other financial information.  The models are trained using such information so that they can recognize similarities between the current Business User and other Business Users who have benefitted from our products in the past.  To the extent that Business Users are individuals, such data may constitute Personal Data.
As a Stripe User and as a data controller, what does GDPR mean for me?
As a data controller, Business Users are responsible for the relationship with the data subject (i.e., your End Customer). You may instruct a third party (like Stripe) to process the data, but it is your job to set the purpose (or objectives) and legal basis for the processing.
The GDPR requires data controllers to use third parties who agree to abide by certain contractual terms. To be sure of this, the data controller must have Data Processing Agreements (“DPAs”) with each third party. Our DPA has been designed to serve this purpose for you; it is strongly aligned with payment transactions, so it should establish that you are compliant with GDPR from a payments perspective.
Who are Stripe’s sub-processors and how are they vetted?
Please see our
service providers page
where we have a list of our most common sub-processors, service providers and affiliates. Stripe identifies, evaluates, and engages sub-processors through our vendor management program. We enter into a contract with each sub-processor prior to sharing data with the sub-processor, and each contract contains terms that provide for monitoring and audit. In addition, all potential vendors are vetted and approved through Stripe’s security review process before we begin using their services.
From where does Stripe collect information used for fraud prevention and security purposes?
To prevent fraud and strengthen our security, we may collect information from Business Users, End Customers, End Users, financial parties, and in some cases third parties. For example, we collect and analyze information that helps us identify bad actors and bots, including both transactional data (such as amount, customer shipping address, date, and so on) and advanced fraud detection signals (device and activity signals).
Learn more
.
Stripe also receives information from third parties to prevent and respond to security incidents, and for protecting against other fraudulent activity. For example, we may receive information from third parties about IP addresses that malicious actors have compromised. Stripe may use Representatives' Personal Data provided at onboarding to query third party databases regarding fraud and risk signals associated with that data.  The third party providers operating these databases may use Stripe’s experience with the Personal Data queried to inform their fraud and risk signals.
How does Stripe use and share data to authenticate my transactions?
To help prevent fraudulent transactions when you use your debit or credit card to pay a Business User, we may share data related to you and your transaction with your card issuer, bank, and payment method provider so that they can verify your identity and authenticate your payment method.  The data we share to enable this process may include personal data such as your name, email address and phone number, and payment-specific data like your billing and shipping address.
Issuers and payment method providers may use the information we share to verify you through a process called 3D Secure Authentication or 3DS.  3DS is an authentication standard designed by the major card networks which aims to reduce fraud and provide added security by providing an additional layer of authentication to online card payments. 3DS is often known by its branded names like Visa Secure, Mastercard Identity Check, or American Express SafeKey. It works by comparing the information you provide at the time of the transaction with the information that your issuer and payment method provider already have on file, to help reduce the risk that someone else may use your card for an unauthorized transaction.
Additionally, we may share contextual data, such as your device ID and previous transaction history. The process may take place as part of the checkout flow, which may involve you being redirected to another page where your bank asks you for a code or password to approve the purchase.
3DS is frequently used in Europe in support of Strong Customer Authentication requirements under the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and to comply with similar regulations in other countries including the UK, India and Australia.  When we act as a service provider to your bank under our Stripe Issuing program we and our service providers may use personal data such as your card number, contact information, payment-specific data, like your billing and shipping address, and contextual data such as your device ID and transaction history to facilitate 3DS authentication.
How does Stripe use Personal Data to prevent fraud?
The Stripe products that use Personal Data to enable Stripe’s Business Users to detect and prevent fraud include Stripe Radar, Stripe Identity, and Stripe Merchant Risk Tooling.  Stripe also employs internal risk models and other product features, such as 3D Secure incorporated into Stripe’s Issuing product, to prevent its products and services from being used for fraudulent activity.
Stripe Radar processes personal data as described
here
using its machine learning model to produce scores indicating the likelihood that a payment method is being offered by someone other than an authorized user.  These scores are designed to identify fraudulent transactions, they do not rate the character or creditworthiness of the individuals involved in a particular transaction.  Based on the service selected by the Business User, Stripe may provide the Radar scores to its Business Users to help them to combat fraud and provide a mechanism for them to set rules to better manage transactions based on Radar scores and other indicators of fraud.
Stripe Identity uses Personal Data, as described
here
, to combat fraud by enabling Business Users to verify whether the person they are transacting with is who they say they are. Identity compares biometric identifiers in a selfie against government issued ID. Identity can also validate Personal Data, such as name, date of birth, and government ID number, that an End Customer types into a web form against government and third-party databases to determine if the identity presented matches the government issued ID number.
Stripe’s internal risk models seek to combat fraud by recognizing when a fraudster is attempting to use Stripe’s services for fraudulent purposes. For instance, Stripe uses Radar scores internally to determine whether a payment method offered to Stripe products such as Link, Frontier, Crypto Onramp, and Bill Pay should be accepted or rejected as likely fraudulent.  Stripe’s internal risk models also use aggregated cardholder features to recognize when a large number of transactions are likely being conducted by the same individual for purposes of testing or cashing out stolen payment methods. Where Stripe recognizes such activity, it will block transactions to prevent harm to itself, its users, and others.
Stripe Merchant Risk Tooling leverages Stripe’s internal risk models to help Stripe Connect Platforms identify indicators of potential fraud associated with their Connected Accounts. Merchant Risk Tooling produces reasoned scores that identify to Platform’s internal fraud teams when there are indicators consistent with a Connected Account attempting to use the Platform’s services (and Stripe) for fraudulent purposes. These scores are designed to supplement the Platforms’ due diligence related to their Connected Accounts and their business activities.  They do not score the character or creditworthiness of the individuals involved in the Connected Accounts’ operations. The data factored into Merchant Risk Tooling includes payments transaction data, business representative details (such as IP address, physical address, and e-mail address) business website content, and other information regarding the businesses Business Users operate on Stripe.
Along with attempting to combat fraud at the merchant and Stripe-wide levels as described above, Stripe also incorporates features in its individual products that use Personal Data to  prevent fraud. One such feature is 3D Secure authentication, incorporated in Stripe Issuing.  This feature is required by law in certain jurisdictions and requires cardholders to authenticate using one or more factors before they can complete an online transaction.  Stripe and its service providers use and store personal data including cardholder PANs, contact information, and transaction history to authenticate cardholders using one time passcodes and knowledge of past transactions. These measures help combat fraud by increasing the likelihood that the person offering a card for payment is an authorized user.
I heard that Stripe is collecting additional information about my account from a third party and/or my other Stripe account. Why is Stripe collecting this information?
Stripe may collect additional information about your account to allow Stripe and its financial partners to detect fraud and/or fulfill financial compliance requirements. These requirements come from our financial partners or regulatory obligations and are intended to prevent abuse of the financial system. Examples of missing data fields include your address, phone number, social security number, date of birth, employer identification number, or website URL. Stripe may be able to fill in some of this information by leveraging data we have collected from one of your other Stripe accounts or by obtaining data from a third party. We will show Business Users the information that we are associating with their account on your dashboard, and Business Users may update or correct that information via your dashboard. Please see Stripe’s
Privacy Policy
for additional information.
Does Stripe collect precise location data?
Devices such as mobile phones or computers may collect precise location data using GPS technology.  Stripe does not collect GPS data from devices and browsers.
Depending on the Services you use and the Business Users’ implementation of our Business Services, we will collect information (including IP addresses) through cookies and similar technology. We will collect your IP address when you visit our Sites. Please see our
Cookie Policy
to learn more.  Stripe may use location information, including approximate latitude and longitude, derived from End Customers IP addresses to detect potentially fraudulent transactions.
We also receive approximate location information (such as country, city or state) from third party providers such as
MaxMind
to help us determine the approximate location of visitors to our website for marketing purposes (for example, inviting you to local Stripe events).
In addition to its sub-processors, what other third parties does Stripe share information with?
When we work with service providers in our capacity as a data processor for our Business Users’ and End Users’ personal data, the GDPR calls these third-party service providers a sub-processor. Sub-processors are service providers who have or potentially will have access to or process personal data on behalf of Stripe. These third parties are disclosed on our
Stripe Service Providers
List.
In addition to Stripe’s sub-processors, we may also share Business Users’ onboarding data and payment instrument information with third party business partners when this is necessary to provide our services to our Business Users. We do so, for example, for the purposes of offering payment processing services to our Business Users or facilitating payment settlements.
Third parties to whom we may disclose personal data for this purpose are banks, payment method providers and payment processors, including, but not limited to, the following entities:
American Express Payment Services Limited and American Express Payments Europe S.L.
Banking Circle S.A.
Barclays Bank PLC
Citibank Europe plc
Credit Mutuel Arkea and Arkea Banking Services
Currence iDEAL B.V.
Klarna AB
Mastercard Europe S.A.
Polski Standard Płatności
PPRO Financial Ltd.
Swisscard AECS GmbH
Visa Europe Limited
The data shared with payment method providers will depend on the payment method(s) enabled on the Business User’s account.
In addition, Stripe shares personal data as we believe necessary to, among other things, protect Stripe’s services, rights, privacy, safety and property of Stripe, our users or others. For example, to protect our services, Stripe may receive or disclose information about IP addresses that malicious actors have compromised.
Please note that if you provide us with your payment method information (e.g., a card number and expiration date) to store on file or otherwise in connection with a transaction, Stripe may update your card information if your information has changed or been updated to ensure your transactions go through smoothly, including by working with your card issuer or payment card network. If you would prefer to not have your updated payment method details shared with us, please reach out to your card issuing bank.
Transfer
Stripe will pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or sub-processors, if deemed strictly necessary to carry out contractual obligations or for the data to be processed. Depending on the enabled payment method(s), data may be transferred to the jurisdiction(s) of the respective payment method(s). Before we engage any third party, we perform due diligence, including a vendor security assessment. All of our service providers are subject to contract terms designed to ensure that these service providers process personal data only for the purposes of providing services to Stripe and in accordance with our commitments to Users and applicable data protection laws. Moreover, Stripe maintains and enforces a security program that addresses the management of security and the security controls employed by Stripe, which includes third party risk management. In addition, Stripe employees, agents, and contractors acknowledge their data security and privacy responsibilities under Stripe’s policies.

What Business User and Representative data does Stripe share with a payment method to facilitate Business Users’ enabling the payment method?
Stripe makes it possible for its Business Users to enable payment methods including card networks such as Visa and MasterCard, mobile and online payment methods such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, and buy now pay later providers such as Klarna and Afterpay.  Certain payment methods are enabled by default when you onboard with Stripe. After onboarding, for eligible users, Stripe may enable additional payment methods after notifying you. Your Stripe dashboard allows you to enable or disable payment methods at any time.
Stripe may share information regarding a Business User and the Business User’s Representative with a payment method provider when a payment method is enabled and when Stripe processes transactions involving the payment method. The payment method provider may require Business Users’ and their Representatives' Personal Data for a number of purposes, including complying with know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering, and other legal and compliance requirements, preventing fraud, facilitating transactions, providing services to Business Users, and servicing the payment method’s platform. For these purposes, Stripe may provide payment method providers with Business User data, including but not limited to business name, business type, merchant category codes, merchant ID, transaction history, bank account information, and other transaction specific information such as product type and tax amount that Stripe ascertains from that data.  Stripe may also provide payment methods with Business Users’ Representatives’ personal data, including name, address, contact information, date of birth, tax identification number, and other government issued ID information.  The information Stripe shares with payment method providers is data that Stripe has collected from the merchant or ascertained from data provided by the merchant.
How does Stripe use Representative contact information to provide its Services?
As part of providing our Services we may process Representative contact information for purposes including authentication, providing updates regarding the Services, providing support, and to address issues related to Business Users’ Stripe accounts, such as unpaid balances.
What data about End-Customers and their transactions is used by Radar and what data does Stripe share with its Radar Business Users?
When processing payments, it’s valuable to Stripe, Business Users and End Customers to enable legitimate transactions while also trying to prevent fraudulent transactions, making online purchases safer for everyone involved.
Radar
helps detect potentially fraudulent transactions for Stripe’s Business Users (i.e., merchants) through
machine learning
and other techniques. To do this, Radar leverages data collected across our Services.
Radar’s machine learning model produces transaction “scores” indicating the model’s assessment of the likelihood that a transaction is fraudulent.  Business Users can leverage this score and use it to implement automated rules to determine whether to allow, block, or flag transactions for additional review. Business Users can use Radar as one of multiple inputs in making decisions with respect to the potential for fraud in a transaction.
Radar uses data collected about the End Customer from various sources, including payments transaction data,
advanced fraud detection
data, Bank Connections data, IP address, and physical address information. Radar uses this data to assess whether the payment method offered by the End Customer is likely unauthorized.
Stripe may share with the Business User and allow them to export (where allowed by Law) certain information relevant to fraud detection, including:
a transaction score that assesses the likelihood of the transaction becoming a fraudulent charge-back,
risk insights
for that transaction,
related payments
made by the End-Customer to the Business User,
other transaction data
related to that End-Customer’s transaction with that Business User (e.g., cardholder name, card information, and the payment amount and date),
device and browser information for the device used to make the transaction with that Business User, and
aggregated benchmarks
.
As a Business User, what notice do I provide to my End Customers about Stripe?
Under the terms of our agreements, Business Users are required to provide all necessary notices and obtain all necessary rights and consents from their End Customers to enable Stripe to lawfully collect, use, retain and disclose the Personal Data as part of the Stripe Services. Business Users, as data controllers, are responsible for the contents of their privacy notice and cookie banner. As an example, here is a paragraph that you can consider adding to your privacy notice (if you don’t already have such a disclosure):
We use Stripe for payments, analytics, and other business services. Stripe may collect personal data including via cookies and similar technologies. The personal data Stripe collects may include transactional data and identifying information about devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection, loss prevention, authentication, and analytics related to the performance of its services. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at

Does Stripe “sell” or “share” my personal information under the CCPA?
We do not transfer your personal data to third parties in exchange for payment. However, as noted above, we may provide your personal data to third party partners, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our products and services to you. Because these third parties may use the data Stripe provides for their own purposes (such as to improve their ad delivery), Stripe's provision of data to these parties may be considered a data “sale” or “sharing” as those terms are defined under the CCPA and other applicable US privacy laws. To our knowledge, Stripe does not sell personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
Within the past 12 months, the following categories of Personal Information described in section 1798.80(e) of the California Civil Code have been “sold” or “shared” (as defined under the CCPA) to third parties (including advertising partners) who assist us in advertising our services:

Stripe Connect At a Glance
Description
Stripe Connect is a payment software your third party platform provider (Platform) may use to enable you to receive Stripe services (including payment processing) and/or receive payouts.
Data Controller/ Data Processor
Stripe acts as both a data controller and data processor for the Platform. The Stripe entity that acts as data controller/ data processor for data processed in Europe is Stripe Payments Europe Limited (“SPEL”).
Personal Data
The personal data transmitted to Stripe usually involves first name, last name, address, identification number, e-mail address, IP address, telephone number, and other data necessary for payment processing.
Purpose
The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing, ledger management, and fraud prevention. The Business User / Platform will transfer personal data to Stripe. The personal data exchanged between Stripe and the Business User / Platform may be transmitted to verification agencies, and Business User data may be shared with Platforms. This transmission is intended for the Platform to manage its ledger and for Stripe to conduct identity and risk checks.

Privacy Policy
For full details please see the applicable
Privacy Policy
of Stripe.
I am a user with a Custom connected account. Does Stripe also collect information about my Custom connected account from a third party?
If you are a user with a Custom connected account, Stripe may collect additional information about your account to enable fraud detection and fulfill financial compliance requirements. These requirements for additional information come from our regulators or financial partners and are intended to prevent abuse of the financial system. Examples of missing data fields include your address, phone number, social security number, date of birth, employer identification number, or website URL. Stripe may leverage data we already have from one of your Stripe accounts or Stripe may fill in some of this information by receiving data from a third party. You may view the information that we are associating with your account and update or correct that information by contacting the platform or business that created your Stripe payment account. Please see Stripe’s
Privacy Policy
for additional information.
What responsibilities do Connect platforms with custom accounts have to allow their users to update or correct information associated with their accounts?
You, the Platform, are responsible for all interactions with your Custom accounts and for collecting all of the information needed to verify the Custom account-holders. Since Custom account holders cannot log into Stripe, it is up to you to build the user dashboard and communication channels. You are responsible for actioning any request by a user to update or correct their Stripe Custom account information.
I am a user with a Custom connected account. Will data collected from a third party be visible to my customers?
Card networks and issuers use statement descriptors to identify payments on a cardholder’s bank statement. Statement descriptors usually include information about the payment, such as the name and phone number of the seller. However, the exact information displayed is ultimately up to a cardholder’s bank. If Stripe updates your account’s business address, phone number, or email address, these fields may be displayed on the statement descriptor within the cardholder’s bank statement. However, the exact information displayed is ultimately up to the card network or the cardholder’s bank. If any information is incorrect, please reach out to the platform through which you receive charges to ensure you have provided them with the most accurate information about you and your business.
What are Stripe ACS, Transaction Authentication, and Behavioral Biometrics?
What is Stripe ACS?
Stripe ACS is Stripe’s transaction authentication solution for card issuers (e.g., banks). Stripe ACS helps card issuers to authenticate transactions of cardholders when they are making payments online using their cards.
What is behavioral biometrics?
Behavioral biometrics is an innovative technology that can be used for the purpose of preventing fraud and identifying legitimate transactions. Behavioral biometrics leverages a combination of personal data and device characteristics to distinguish between legitimate customers and fraudsters or bots.
How is behavioral biometrics data collected and used in Stripe ACS?
This processing is designed to verify a cardholder’s identity based on their behavioral biometric data which is modeled based on data collected during each authentication attempt.
This type of transaction authentication will typically observe interactions within a system or device to verify a cardholder’s identity for the purposes of authenticating online payments. The following elements may be processed during the authentication process:
Length of text field inputs
Location of mouse pointer
Modifier key details (e.g., CTRL, SHIFT)
Timing and location of mouse clicks
Timing and location of touch events
Timing between keystrokes
Window scroll position
For the purpose of fraud risk mitigation, this processing involves use of a device identifier cookie (Ndcd, Device ID, DID) that aims to accurately analyze biometrics data observed on a specific device. This cookie facilitates device detection in order to enhance fraud detection and prevention as well as to identify suspicious devices or devices that are behaving abnormally. For more information on how we use cookies, please see
Stripe’s Cookie Policy
.
Purpose of processing and Stripe’s role
Stripe may process biometric data relating to cardholders in order to assist card issuers to authenticate payment transactions. This is done as part of Stripe’s payment transaction authentication services provided to card issuers (including for the purposes of meeting
Strong Customer Authentication
requirements).
In providing these services to card issuers, Stripe acts as a data controller in relation to cardholder data. Please see Stripe’s
Privacy Policy
to learn more about our use of personal data.
As part of providing this authentication services to card issuers, Stripe engages with a third party provider, Mastercard, which also acts as a data controller. See
Mastercard’s Privacy Notice
for details on Mastercard’s processing activities in this context.
Customers rights and choices
Upon initiating a transaction, cardholders will have the option of providing their consent to processing their behavioral biometrics data as part of the transaction authentication flow. This will be presented to the cardholder during the checkout flow on the merchant’s website or app when authentication is requested from the card issuer. Cardholders will have the option to withdraw their consent during each subsequent transaction flow.
To withdraw consent outside of a transaction flow, you can email
privacy-acs@stripe.com
with the subject matter line “Stripe ACS -
withdraw consent
”. In your email to withdraw consent, please provide: (a) the first 6 digits of your card number as this enables Stripe to identify your issuing bank (please do not provide any digits other than the first 6 digits); and (b) the phone number (including the country code) registered with your bank account that is used for one-time passcodes.
We will action this withdrawal request as soon as possible after it is verified, but please note that this can take up to 10 working days as we may need to verify the request with your card issuer. You may also contact the card issuer in order for the issuer to implement this withdrawal of consent by engaging with Stripe.
To submit a request to exercise any of the other
rights
described in our Privacy Policy, you may contact Stripe at
privacy-acs@stripe.com

Promotional Emails Feature
For End Customers and prospective End Customers of our Business Users
What is the Promotional Emails feature?
Promotional Emails is a feature that gives Business Users who use “Stripe Checkout” services a new tool to enable sending email promotional content to their customers and prospective customers. When you visit a Business User’s checkout page (that is powered by Stripe Checkout services), the Promotional Email feature will enable Stripe to collect information about your preferences to receive promotional emails from that merchant.
Promotional email preferences are collected whether or not you complete the purchase or are just a prospective End Customer. “Prospective End Customer” means you visited a Business User’s site and expressed an intent to make a purchase by starting a purchase on the Business User’s checkout page, but did not complete that purchase during that session. To be a “prospective End Customer” for the promotional email feature, you also need to have started to input your contact information into the checkout form, and then not delete that information prior to the end of the session.
If you, prospective End Customer, indicate permission to receive news and personalized offers by virtue of the opt-in/opt-out checkbox on your Business User’s checkout form, the following personal data is provided to your Business User so that your Business User can contact you to remind you of the items you left in the checkout or to provide you news and personalized offers:
Email (if provided by you).
Items in your cart with that merchant (if any).
“Personalized offers” means promotional or marketing materials tailored to you, such as coupons or advertisements based on the items in your cart or (in some cases) your prior purchases from that Business User. Even if you opt-out of personalized offers by a Business User, if you do business with that Business User, they may still need to contact you in order to enable a purchase (e.g., for delivery or billing purposes) or in connection with customer support. Please see your Business User’s privacy policy for more information.
What is Stripe’s role (Data Processor/Controller) in the processing of my Personal Data?
For the Promotional Emails feature, Stripe acts as a
data processor
or service provider, meaning that Stripe is acting at the direction of the Business User that has implemented this Stripe provided feature. The Stripe entity that acts as a data processor for personal data is:
Stripe Inc. in the United States.
Stripe Payments Europe Limited outside of the United States, including Europe
What Personal Data Is Stripe Collecting?
Stripe’s
Privacy Policy
describes in more detail the personal data that Stripe collects in connection with payment transactions.
What Personal Data is Shared by Stripe with the Business Users I use?
Whenever you complete a transaction on a Business User’s website that uses Stripe services, as a service provider to that Business User, Stripe will share your contact information with that Business User. Business Users use the information that Stripe provides in accordance with its own privacy policy, including in connection with your purchase.
With the Promotional Emails feature:
If you complete a purchase with a Business User, in addition to the transaction-related information identified in our
Privacy Policy
(e.g., your contact and billing information and the details of your transaction), Stripe will also share with your Business User your personalized offers and news preferences as determined by the opt-in/opt-out checkbox from your checkout form.
If you are a prospective
End Customer
(you start a purchase with your Business User on their checkout form but do not complete that purchase), the personal data that we share with your Business User depends on the following:
If you have not inputted any personal data into your Business User’s checkout form, then we will not share any personal data with that Business User.
If you have inputted personal data into your Business User’s checkout form:
If the checkbox for receiving news and personalized offers is not enabled when you leave your Business User’s checkout session, we will not share any of that personal data.
If the checkbox for receiving news and personalized offers is enabled when you leave your Business User’s checkout session, we will share the following information with that Business User:
Email (if provided by you).
Items in your cart with that merchant (if any).
End Customers and prospective End customers should always review the privacy policy or notice of the Business Users they visit and do business with for information about the Business User’s data collection practices and purposes outside of this Stripe feature.
Does Stripe share my personal data with other Business Users?
No. Stripe does not share personal data collected in connection with purchases (or attempted purchases) from one Business User’s checkout with another Business User. Please see our Privacy Policy to learn more about our practices.
How do I stop promotional emails from a merchant?
Any offers or promotional emails that you receive as a result of a Business User’s use of the Promotional Emails feature are sent by Business Users (or others identified in the message), and not by Stripe. I If you do not find value in receiving these emails, please contact the Business User you are receiving the messages from.

Security at Stripe
for more information.

Stripe does not sell your personal data. See our Privacy Policy for more information. The Promotional Emails feature is not the sale of personal data.

Please contact your Business User to learn about their personal data practices and how you can exercise rights to stop the sale or processing of personal data provided under applicable law and/or their privacy policy.
Stripe requires that Business Users that choose to implement the Promotional Email feature also provide the option to unsubscribe or opt-out of receiving further promotional messages. It would be a breach of Stripe’s terms of service for a Business User to not promptly comply with opt-out requests.

International Data Transfers
The detail below is provided for informational purposes. It is not intended to provide legal advice. Stripe urges Business Users to consult with counsel to familiarize themselves with the requirements that govern their specific situations.
How is Stripe dealing with its international data transfers?
As a global business, Personal Data may be transferred to, and processed, in any country where we do business, where our service providers do business or if you use an international payment method or financial partner service, the countries in which that payment method or financial partner operates.
We may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than your own country, including to the United States. Stripe relies on a number of data transfer mechanisms to legalize the transfer of Personal Data around the globe.
Stripe continues to have appropriate safeguards and compliance measures to ensure an adequate level of protection of Personal Data transferred outside the UK, EEA and Switzerland. Stripe’s measures may include:
Transferring Personal Data from the originating to a country or recipient that has been deemed to have an adequate level of data protection by relevant privacy authorities, including the European Commission.
The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), which allows personal data to flow freely between the EEA and certified organizations in the U.S. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision confirming that personal data can be transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to certified U.S. organizations. The UK Government similarly confirmed that organizations can rely on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (“UK Extension”) to transfer data from the UK to certified U.S. organizations. The Swiss Federal Council has confirmed that organizations can rely on the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) to transfer data from Switzerland to certified US companies and it has adopted an adequacy decision for the U.S. in this respect. Stripe’s parent entity, Stripe, Inc, is certified under the EU-U.S DPF, Swiss-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension. Stripe relies on the Data Privacy Framework to transfer personal data from respectively the EEA, the UK and Switzerland to the US. To learn more about the DPF program, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
, and to view our certification, please see
here
.
The Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) approved by the European Commission. SCCs are a transfer mechanism (in the form of a legal contract) used by Stripe to provide a legal mechanism to transfer EU personal data outside of the EEA/UK. These are required under EU data protection law (known as the GDPR) and are incorporated into our agreements.
The UK International Data Transfer Addendum (“UK Addendum”) issued by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office to provide a legal mechanism to transfer Personal Data from the UK. This mechanism is required under UK data protection law (known as UK GDPR) and is incorporated into our agreements.
Other alternative data transfer mechanisms approved by relevant privacy authorities to enable the transfer of Personal Data to a third country.
Stripe respects the privacy of everyone that engages with our products and services, and we are committed to being transparent about our privacy processes and policies. To learn more about our commitment to privacy and data security, please see our
Privacy Policy
, the rest of the
Stripe Privacy Center
, and the
Stripe Security Center
.
We also want to highlight some of our supplementary measures to protect our Business Users’ data from unauthorized access.
Stripe employs security controls and maintains and enforces a security program that addresses the management of security. We also perform risk assessments and implement and maintain controls for risk identification, analysis, monitoring, reporting, and corrective action. Stripe maintains and enforces an asset management program that appropriately classifies and controls hardware and software assets throughout their life cycle. In addition, Stripe employees, agents, and contractors acknowledge their data security and privacy responsibilities under Stripe’s policies.
Stripe applies technical and organizational measures that include the following:
Virtual access control to prevent data processing systems from being used by unauthorized persons.
Data access control to ensure that persons entitled to use a data processing system gain access only to such Personal Data in accordance with their access rights, and that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization.
Disclosure control to ensure that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization during electronic transmission, transport or storage on storage media (manual or electronic), and that it can be verified to which companies or other legal entities Personal Data are disclosed.
Entry control to audit whether data have been entered, changed or removed (deleted), and by whom, from data processing systems.
Stripe relies on third party service providers to host its production infrastructure. Those third parties apply physical access control to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to the data processing systems available at premises and facilities (including databases, application servers, and related hardware), where Personal Data are processed.
Availability control to ensure that Personal Data are protected against accidental destruction or loss (physical/logical).
Separation control to ensure that Personal Data collected for different purposes can be processed separately.
By default, Stripe encrypts data at rest and data in transit. We further protect your data with tools like audit logs, access management policies and certifications as described on our
Payments
page in the section “Security and compliance at the core”. Security controls implemented at Stripe include TLS 1.2 configuration of endpoints for data in transit, TLS and/or SSL encryption for HTTPS and regular testing of infrastructure components. Two-step authentication is available for an extra layer of security at Dashboard login.
We get requests for access to data from law enforcement, and we review each request with the goal of responding with the minimum amount of required information in response to legitimate, legally mandated requests.
If you have any questions, please

.
Is Stripe certified under the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework?
Stripe has certified its participation in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Stripe relies on the DPF to enable international transfers. In case the DPF is invalidated or Stripe is otherwise prevented from relying on the DPF, we incorporate multiple transfer mechanisms to ensure that data transfers can continue. If more than one data transfer mechanism applies, the DPF takes precedence. You can learn more about our certification and read the Stripe Data Privacy Framework Policy at
https://stripe.com/legal/data-privacy-framework
.
How does Stripe’s certification under the EU-U.S. DPF impact my organization?
The EU-U.S. DPF is a legal framework that allows organizations to transfer EEA Personal Data  to certified organizations in the U.S. Stripe’s
Data Transfers Addendum
sets out the data transfer mechanisms that Stripe may rely on to carry out international transfers of personal data, including the EU-U.S. DPF. You can learn more about our certification and read the Stripe Data Privacy Framework Policy at
https://stripe.com/legal/data-privacy-framework
. If you are a Business User and would like to transfer data to us under the DPF, please
contact us
or your account manager if you have any questions.
How do the SCCs and UK Addendum impact my organization?
SCCs are legal contracts entered into between parties that are transferring EEA Personal Data outside of the EEA. Stripe may rely on the SCCs for transfers of EEA data in our services. We have updated our Data Transfer Addendum and agreements to incorporate the SCCs (where applicable).
How to get a copy of the SCCs or UK Addendum?
You can review our Data Transfers Addendum which includes the latest data transfer mechanisms, including the SCCs, the UK addendum and the Swiss addendum

What is CBPR and PRP and is Stripe certified?
Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) schemes are frameworks designed to facilitate data privacy harmonization across international boundaries, primarily within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region. CBPR is aimed at organizations handling personal data as a data controller, ensuring compliance with APEC’s privacy standards and enabling secure cross-border data flow. It requires certified organizations to develop privacy policies that meet APEC's criteria and undergo independent certification. PRP, on the other hand, is tailored for data processors, establishing standards for how processors manage and secure data on behalf of data controllers. It provides a mechanism for demonstrating compliance with global privacy requirements, promoting trust and accountability.
Stripe’s privacy practices comply with CBPR and PRP systems as evidenced by the CBPR and PRP certifications Stripe has obtained. To view the status of our certifications, please click
here
(CBPR) and
here
(PRP).
Where CBPR and/or PRP are recognized as a valid transfer mechanism under applicable law, Stripe will transfer Personal Data in accordance with the CBPR and PRP certifications Stripe has obtained.
Why is Stripe storing authentication and authorization data globally?
We have integrated a robust, multi-region infrastructure dedicated to optimizing authentication, authorization, and identity management. This infrastructure spans multiple geographic regions, specifically including our data centers located in the United States and India. By adopting this global approach, we have significantly enhanced the speed and reliability of our services, allowing users to benefit from faster and more consistent access to their data, regardless of their location. This advancement results in a superior and seamless service experience with reduced latency, which is essential for maintaining high standards of user satisfaction.
Our focus on global data storage centers around particular categories of Personal Data, strictly limited to aspects of user authentication and security. The specific types of data stored globally include Representative identifying information such as name, location, email address, phone number, date of birth, IP address, and device ID. These elements are integral to various facets of our operations, including login credentials and settings for multi-factor authentication, as well as device information and security challenges relevant to account security. Additionally, session management data, user roles and permissions, team invitations and management, and Single Sign-On (SSO) configurations fall under this umbrella of globally stored data.
Importantly, this global storage strategy does not extend to any transactional information or other data related to End Customers.

How do I access my data?

If you are the End Customer of a Business User that uses Stripe services, the Business User would be the correct party to respond to a data subject access request related to your transactional information.
Depending on your location and subject to applicable law, you may have the right to request confirmation of whether Stripe processes Personal Data relating to you, and if so, to request a copy of that Personal Data. If you are an End User or otherwise have a direct relationship with us, you may submit your access request by
email
, or through our
form
. Please note that we may need to verify your identity and your relationship with us before we can proceed with your request.

How do I unsubscribe from marketing emails?

here

here
.
If you are a Link user, you may opt-out from marketing-related emails by using the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you receive, or by managing your subscription preferences in the Link website. To manage your preferences log into your

When does Stripe continue to process data after it has received a deletion request or objection to the processing?
In certain circumstances, Stripe may be required by law to retain and process your Personal Data  even after a deletion request or objection to the processing.  For instance, Stripe is required to retain certain Personal Data it receives from its Business Users to satisfy legal obligations under Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws.
Stripe may also rely on compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing your Personal Data. Stripe may act on such grounds, for instance, when it takes steps to prevent fraud and financial crimes.  When Personal Data is necessary to enable or maintain the integrity of Stripe’s fraud detection and financial models, Stripe may not be able to honor requests to delete or stop processing that data.  If Stripe honored such requests, fraudsters might take advantage of its willingness to do so to seek deletion of data related to their past fraudulent activities.  Without such data, Stripe would be less able to recognize similar activities in the future.
What data may be shared or made available to enable me to see Stripe ads on other sites?

Cookies & Other Technology
How does Stripe use cookies?
We use cookies to (1) ensure that our services function properly, (2) prevent and detect fraud and violations of our terms of service, (3) understand how visitors use and engage with our website and (4) analyze and improve our services. Depending on your relationship with Stripe and the domain you are visiting, different cookies apply. For instance some cookies are set on a public Stripe or Link domain, some on the Stripe Dashboard or a Link settings page, and some on the payment page available to end users who make payments using Stripe services, including Link.
Cookies play an important role in helping Stripe provide personal, effective and safe services. Please be mindful that we change the cookies periodically as we improve or add to our services. For more information, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
What is Stripe.js?
Stripe.js is a JavaScript library that businesses use to integrate Stripe and accept online payments (corresponding iOS and Android SDKs enable the same use cases). Stripe uses Stripe.js to facilitate fraud prevention technologies and the use of its Link payment services on the websites of Business Users.
For fraud detection, Stripe.js uses cookies, including `__stripe_mid`, `__stripe_sid`, and `m`, to collect signals differentiating legitimate behavior from fraudulent behavior.  For example, fraudsters and bots often spend less time on Business Users’ pages than legitimate End Customers. We are able to detect this behavior and use it in evaluating the risk that a transaction is fraudulent.
When you visit a site that uses Stripe, you might see this fraud prevention activity in a privacy report or tracker list on your web browser. Stripe doesn’t—and won’t—share or sell the fraud data it collects using Stripe.js to advertisers. Stripe works to keep this fraud detection data  secure and ensure it does not leave Stripe infrastructure. It is exchanged between the following Stripe-controlled hosts:js.stripe.com, m.stripe.network, and m.stripe.com, and access to this data is tightly restricted to a small number of Stripe employees whose security permissions are regularly reviewed. You can read more about how Stripe uses data for fraud prevention in our
Privacy Policy
.
Stripe also uses the Stripe.js library to implement cookies and similar technology such as `pay_sid`, `link.auth_session_client_secret`, and `elements_session` to enable Link to remember users’ information for faster checkout across Stripe merchant sites and to collect analytics related to Link’s implementation on checkout pages.
You should regularly review the Stripe cookies that are placed on your website and other data collected by Stripe.js. You should consult your counsel regarding how best to disclose this data collection to your customers, including by updating your cookie banner. But, here is a paragraph you could add to your privacy disclosures if they do not already include such information:
We use Stripe for payments, analytics, and other business services. Stripe may collect personal data including via cookies and similar technologies. The personal data Stripe collects may include transactional data and identifying information about devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection, loss prevention, authentication, and analytics related to the performance of its services. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at
https://stripe.com/privacy
.
What are advanced fraud signals?
Stripe’s advanced fraud detection looks at signals about device characteristics and user activity indicators that help distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. These signals are highly indicative of fraud and power Stripe’s fraud prevention systems, such as Radar. The signals are securely transmitted to Stripe’s backend by periodically making requests to the m.stripe.com endpoint.
You can learn more in our documentation for
advanced fraud detection
.
Why are advanced fraud signals not ad tracking?
Stripe only uses these advanced fraud detection signals to enable secure payments and prevent fraud. We don’t use this data to build individual profiles or share or sell it to third-party advertisers.
You can read more about how we use this data in our
Privacy Policy
.
What obligations should merchants keep in mind relating to cookie technology on their sites?
This article aims to provide information about the use of cookies and similar technologies (“cookies”) on the websites where you as a merchant may use Stripe services and how the cookies support the functions and features of Stripe's services for merchants. For example, your use of certain Stripe services may load stripe.js. Stripe.js is a javascript library provided by Stripe, and in one of its functions it uses cookies for various purposes including fraud prevention, authentication, and analytics (for the avoidance of doubt, the elements_session analytics cookie is only set in some US states). Please refer to
https://stripe.com/cookie-settings
for more information. The specific cookies used by stripe.js depend on your configuration with the related Stripe products.
For example, one of the key features of stripe.js is the fraud prevention system provided by Stripe's Radar product. Radar uses cookies to help businesses reduce chargebacks and losses from fraudulent transactions.
Please note that the use of cookies may have legal implications depending on the geographical location of your business and customers. As a result, you may need to take appropriate action to ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements related to cookies.
You should regularly review the Stripe cookies that are placed on your website to ensure that your own privacy disclosures tell your end users about this type of data collection, and also update your cookie disclosure and/or consent banner accordingly after reviewing the cookies placed on your website.
Here is a paragraph you could add to your privacy disclosures if it does not already include such a disclosure:
We use Stripe for payments, analytics, and other business services. Stripe may collect personal data including via cookies and similar technologies. The personal data Stripe collects may include transactional data and identifying information about devices that connect to its services.

How does Stripe remember payment method details for Link?
Link (formerly known as “Remember Me”) lets end users save and reuse their payment information for faster checkout at thousands of online businesses that use Stripe. When an end user makes a purchase via a Business User (i.e., merchant) that enables Link, the end user can ask Stripe to remember their payment method details, such as credit and debit card details. If an individual chooses to be remembered, Stripe will remember the end user’s email address, phone number, shipping address, and payment method details for future Link transactions.
The payment method details for future transactions may be remembered across multiple Stripe Business Users. Generally, once the cookie is set, the end user may make “1-click” purchases using Link when you check out, which means that Stripe will automatically populate the end user’s saved information into their checkout on their behalf, and use the information to complete the transaction faster.
If the end user enters their phone number or email address during a future Link transaction, Stripe will authenticate the end user by sending the end user a One Time Passcode (OTP), e.g. via an SMS message or email. If the end user correctly enters the OTP, Stripe or the Business User will set a cookie in the end user’s browser, indicating that the end user has been authenticated. If the end user does not enter the OTP, or elects to “log out” of their Link session then the cookie won’t remember the end user.
A cookie is only stored in a specific browser on a specific device. If an end user wishes to make 1-click purchases in a different browser or on a different device, they must go through the OTP authentication process for the new browser or device combination.
After 90 days, it will be necessary for the end user to re-complete the OTP process. The end user may also proactively remove the cookie by clearing cookies in their browser or by selecting the “log out” option when this option is presented in checkout.
If an end user no longer wishes for Stripe to remember their payment method details when they check out in the future, the end user may use the
self-service deletion tool
. Alternatively, the end user may also contact Stripe support to make this request.
The description above describes how an end user may control how their information is stored and used to check out. However, this does not affect the other contexts in which Stripe may store and use end user information. In particular, Stripe may store and use such information as described elsewhere on this Privacy Center - including for purposes such as for advanced fraud detection.
What obligations should Link users keep in mind relating to cookie technology on their sites?
Based on your integration choice (e.g., for Link in Elements), you may have legal responsibilities associated with cookies and similar technology that Stripe uses for fraud detection and/or authentication purposes.
You should always check with your legal counsel to understand how you should comply with applicable legal obligations with setting cookies and similar technology. This section has information to keep in mind.
Stripe cookies or similar technology are set on your domain (e.g. on your checkout flow) from the Stripe.js library. The current Stripe cookies from the Stripe.js library include fraud prevention cookies like `
__stripe_mid`
, `
__stripe_sid`
, and `
m`
, and also end-user authentication cookies like`
pay_sid`
and `
__Host-LinkSession`
.
You should regularly review the Stripe cookies that are placed on your website to ensure that your own privacy disclosures tell your end users about this type of data collection, and also update your cookie banner accordingly after reviewing the cookies placed on your website.

Akamai has legitimate interest to manage the business relationship with you or the party that you represent,
to respond to any request or inquiries you submit to us, or to submit communication or inquiries to you. If you are acting on your own behalf, Akamai is processing your Contact Information in order to take steps necessary, at your request, to enter into a contract and to perform that contract.

Akamai has legitimate interest to manage the business relationship with you or the party that you represent, to submit inquiries to you or to respond to any request or inquiries you submit to us. If you are acting on your own behalf, Akamai is processing your Contact Information in order to take steps necessary, at your request, to enter into a contract and to perform that contract.
Customer surveys and service improvements:
As part of our customer relationship, we may contact you as our customer or as a representative of a customer or a partner, if applicable (except if you chose not to be contacted by us) via Contact Information you provided, to ask whether you would like to participate in our satisfaction surveys or in market research surveys. We use these surveys to improve our service offering and business operations to better serve you and our customers and partners. Akamai has legitimate interest to maintain viable and efficient business operations through management and improvement of our services, increase customer satisfaction, provide better user experience, and identify ways to grow our business.
Fulfillment of transactions/contractual obligations:
We use Contact Information to respond to requests from current and prospective customers and partners or their representatives, and as needed and appropriate to complete business transactions, comply with contractual requirements,  provide Akamai services and products or access to an Akamai event, webcast, training or other materials.

Please refer to the respective social computing environment to better understand yours, Akamai’s, and other parties’ rights and obligations with regard to such content.

When you are providing more personal data than required for recruitment purposes in accordance with applicable laws, then please note that you are providing such data voluntarily, and Akamai’s processing of such data is based on your consent, which is given through the voluntary submission of your data. If your application is unsuccessful, Akamai may process your data for future recruitment processes based on your consent, or where applicable, our legitimate interest. When you show your general interest in working for Akamai or apply for future recruitment processes, then Akamai is processing your personal data based on your consent.

If you block, turn off, or otherwise reject cookies, some websites or applications may not display properly, or you will not be able to proceed using the website or application, to checkout, for instance.
Some Sites, service offerings, and services also use web beacons or other technologies to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across the Sites. When you as a visitor access these Sites, an unidentifiable notice of that visit is generated, which is processed by the site owner or by third-party service providers. These web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don’t want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these Sites or use of these services, you can control the web beacons via the cookie management tool available on our Sites
or your browser settings. If you turn off cookies, web beacons and other technologies will still detect visits to these sites; however, they will not be associated with information otherwise stored in cookies.
Cookies on Akamai Sites (except for
linode.com
)
We collect information from your visits to our Sites in order to help us gather statistics about usage and effectiveness of our Sites, personalize your experience with our Sites, tailor our interactions with you, and provide, develop, and improve our services. We do so through the processing of transaction logs, as well as the use of various cookie technologies. We use session cookies, for example, for media performance analytics. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location. You can check the list of all cookie technologies used by Akamai Sites via the cookie management tool available on the Sites.

Cookies in Akamai Services
For certain Akamai Services we use cookie technology. We collect information from your interactions with our services or our customers’ service offerings, sites and applications, in order to help us to provide, develop and improve our services. Many Akamai services that you interact with via our customer services use session and persistent cookies in order to provide the service functionality. Examples of the purposes for use of various cookies include determining whether a given interaction is with a human or a “bot,” identifying attempts to bypass security settings, identifying devices that already have been authenticated, web performance analytics, media analytics, and similar necessary service functions. Such cookies are developed based on privacy by design principle, and do not identify individuals nor track them. For example, the domain
go-mpulse.net

Cookies used to provide Akamai security services are classified as strictly necessary cookies for the performance of the services you are requesting. To not undermine the purpose of the services, to protect the personal data submitted by you when using our customers’ web services and products, and to make the internet a safer place, we do not have to offer an opt-out mechanism for the security cookies. If we do, malicious actors would opt out and thereby prevent the detection of their malicious activities.
We offer cookie management options depending on our customers’ classification. Details are available in
Akamai Control Center
or via the responsible Akamai Sales Account representative.
Web Beacons in Marketing Communication
We include web beacons in marketing email messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within have been clicked on and count the number of times that the advertisements and web-based email content are viewed.

Adobe Analytics uses cookies which generate information about your use of our Sites. List of Adobe Analytic cookies used on our Sites can be checked in the cookie management tool available on our Sites
. Adobe Analytics will collect the following data: IP address, usage information, location data. Akamai has enabled IP Obfuscation option which turns IP addresses into non-recognizable strings and original IP addresses are permanently lost.
Data gathered in connection with the use of Adobe Analytics will be used by Akamai to perform analytics on our Sites to better understand how you use our Sites and optimize and adapt it to the needs of website visitors. Data will be collected via servers hosted in Amazon Web Services Inc.’s locations that are closest to the website visitor’s location and will be transferred and stored on Adobe servers in the USA.

These widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, are visible to you on the Sites you visit. When you use these widgets or when you are logged in to those platforms, the respective social media providers may be able to collect information about your use of the Sites. Please view the applicable social media network’s privacy policy to better understand their data collection practices and choices they make available to you.

‍
Where we act as a processor/service provider for our Integrators, we do not use the personal information collected for any purpose other than as reasonably necessary to provide our Service, and our processing will be governed by the contracts that we have in place with our Integrators, not this Privacy Policy
.
If a contract we have with an Integrator refers to, or incorporates by reference, this Privacy Policy, any personal information we process on behalf of the Integrator will be subject to the Data Processing Addendum, not this Privacy Policy.
In some cases, we may license our software to Integrators and/or operate it within their environment on their behalf, in which case we are solely a licensor of software and only their terms and privacy policy shall apply to such personal data.
We may reference or describe some personal data collected from End-Users throughout this Privacy Policy. However, these disclosures are for informational purposes only and, for clarity, the processing of End-User personal data is governed by the agreement we have with our Integrator customers, not this Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions or concerns about how such data is handled or would like to exercise your rights, you should contact the person or entity (i.e., the data controller) who has contracted with us to use the Service to process this data.

What is a Cookie?
A cookie ("Cookie") is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server.

You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below.
We update this list periodically, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Sites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.

They also include Cookies that enable us to remember your previous actions within the same browsing session and secure our Sites.
