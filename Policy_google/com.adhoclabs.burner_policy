Contacting Ad Hoc Labs
Information We Collect About You
In order to provide and improve upon our services and better market our services to customers, we receive and collect information about you in various ways. When you interact with us through our Services, we collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us; when we passively collect information from or about you, such as from your browser or device; and when we collect information about you from third parties. We may combine all of the information we collect from or about you from these various sources.
Information You Provide Directly to Us:
In order for you to use our Services, we may collect limited information about you when you voluntarily provide such information, including your mobile phone number (from which we may derive your mobile carrier). In some other limited cases, we may also collect audio information (such as audio recordings if you do not opt-in to voicemail customization or speech-to-text requests). In some other limited cases, we may also collect your name, postal address, email address,
payment information (through our payment processors), and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. Wherever Ad Hoc Labs collects personal information, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. We will use, transfer and disclose this information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Unsolicited submissions such as ideas that you submit for new products or modifications to existing products, and any other unsolicited submissions shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Ad Hoc Labs shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute, and exploit such unsolicited information without limitation or attribution.
Information that is Automatically Collected:
We also collect information through automated and technical means as you browse our website, use our mobile applications, or otherwise use our Services.
Device and Online Usage Information.
Like most providers of websites and mobile applications, when you interact with our Services, we receive and store certain information that is collected passively using various technologies. This information includes IP address, Media Access Control (MAC) address, device type (e.g., Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language and Internet browser type and version, the pages you view in our Services, pages referring you to our Services, when you use our Services, mobile carrier, time zone, device identifiers (including Apple’s IDFA and Android’s advertising ID), and the sites on which you actively use our Services.
SDKs, Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
.  In operating our Services, we and our service providers also collect data about your use of our Services through the use of a variety of tracking technologies, including SDKs, cookies, tracking pixels, and web server logs, as described below.
We may use SDKs on our mobile applications that leverage identifiers provided in mobile operating systems like iOS and Android to (i) inform, optimize, and serve our marketing to you based on your use of the mobile applications; and (ii) provide analytics on the performance of our marketing.
We may use cookies, tracking pixels and, webserver logs for the same general purposes as SDKs, but on our websites, rather than in our mobile applications. Web server logs provide data on how users behave on our website, which allows us to optimize our website performance. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access our Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to our Services and help us analyze usage of Services more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access our Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once when using our Services. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or emails, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks and measure popularity of our Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. We and our service providers may also include Web beacons in email messages, newsletters and other electronic communications to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics, personalization and advertising purposes. As we and our service providers adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information about how to control cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g.,
Internet Explorer
;
Google Chrome
;
Mozilla Firefox
; or
Apple Safari
). Please note that by blocking any or all tracking technologies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of our Services.
Information We Collect from Third Party Sources
:
Account Registration & Sign-In:
When you use social sign-in to register to use or log in to our Services, we collect certain information from
third party
platforms such as Google, Apple, or Facebook, as applicable to your method of registration. This information may include your name, user ID, email address, and other information available on your public profile on those platforms. The registration process using social sign-in is optional and you may still register for the Services using a phone number.
Other Information:
We may obtain additional information about you from third parties such as partners, social networks (when you post on our social media pages or message us through a social media platform), and others. We may combine information that we collect directly from users with information about you that we obtain from such third parties and information obtained from such third parties and information derived from any other service we provide.
Using Your Information
Ad Hoc Labs uses the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide information in order to obtain access to our Services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
Ad Hoc Labs and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “
Related Companies
”) also use your information to help us improve the content and functionality of our Services; to better understand our users and to improve our Services, including to develop new features or services; for user lookalike modeling, marketing, and advertising; for analytics, research, and reporting; to comply with the law and protect the safety, rights, property, or security of Ad Hoc Labs, our Services, our customers, and the general public; and to enforce our
Terms of Service
.  Ad Hoc Labs and its Related Companies may also use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.
If Ad Hoc Labs intends to use any information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the information is collected.
Disclosing Your Information
Ad Hoc Labs is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may disclose your information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
911 Calls and Requests for Emergency Assistance. NOTE THAT THE SERVICE CAN NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR 911 OR EMERGENCY CALLING
. However, if you attempt to contact emergency services via the Service, we may provide information about you to a public safety answering point; emergency medical service provider or dispatch provider; public safety, fire service, or law enforcement official; or hospital emergency or other medical care facility. As permitted by law, we may also disclose information without a user’s consent in an emergency situation involving risk of death or serious physical harm, such as to a user’s legal guardian or members of a user’s immediate family or to database management services or information providers solely to assist in delivering emergency services.
Affiliates and Subsidiaries:
We may also disclose your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Agents, Consultants, and Similar Third Party Service Providers:
Ad Hoc Labs, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
Business Transfers:
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, or due diligence related in anticipation of such an event, information that we have retained about you may be part of the transferred assets or anticipated transaction.
Consent
: We may also disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so.
De-identified or Aggregated Data
:
When you interact with Ad Hoc Labs through our Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, is not intended to specifically identify you. Ad Hoc Labs may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Ad Hoc Labs affiliates, agents, or service providers. Our Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Services, the number of visitors to each page of our Services, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with our Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of our Services, Ad Hoc Labs sometimes conducts research on its customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis.  Ad Hoc Labs may disclose this de-identified or aggregate data with its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and business partners, but this type of information is not intended to identify you personally. Ad Hoc Labs may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Legal Requirements:
Ad Hoc Labs may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) conform to the law, comply with legal process and government requests, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or activities otherwise inconsistent with our Terms of Service; (ii) enforce our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy; (iii) take precautions against liability, investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ad Hoc Labs, its users and the public.
Our Use of Online Analytics
Online Analytics
We and our service providers (including Google through its provision of Google Analytics services) may also collect analytics data through our Services to collect and analyze that data and to engage in auditing, research, improvement of our Services, and reporting. The information (including your IP address) collected by various analytics technologies described in the “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” section above will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to help us evaluate your use of our Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive to our Services, analyzing usage trends, assisting with fraud prevention, and providing certain features to you. One of our analytics service providers, Google, provides tools to prevent it from using your information for analytics. If you wish to use this tool offered by Google, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking

Notice Concerning Do-Not-Track Signals
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in certain web browsers.

You can learn more about Do Not Track

We do not disclose your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
Notice to Nevada Residents
Under a Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the “sale” of “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons, as those concepts are defined under the Nevada law, which differs from the CCPA. “Personally identifiable information” under that law includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.
We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by contacting
privacy@adhoclabs.co
.  We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.  Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.
Data Retention
We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, subject to the options available to you in “Your
Rights and
Choices” above.  We may also maintain backups of certain data for longer than the original data for security and business continuity purposes.
Security

Information We Collect About You
In order to provide and improve upon our services and better market our services to customers, we receive and collect information about you in various ways. When you interact with us through our Services, we collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us; when we passively collect information from or about you, such as from your browser or device; and when we collect information about you from third parties. We may combine all of the information we collect from or about you from these various sources.
Information You Provide Directly to Us:
In order for you to use our Services, we may collect limited information about you when you voluntarily provide such information, including your mobile phone number (from which we may derive your mobile carrier). In some other limited cases, we may also collect audio information (such as audio recordings if you do not opt-in to voicemail customization or speech-to-text requests). In some other limited cases, we may also collect your name, postal address, email address,
payment information (through our payment processors), and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. Wherever Ad Hoc Labs collects personal information, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. We will use, transfer and disclose this information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Unsolicited submissions such as ideas that you submit for new products or modifications to existing products, and any other unsolicited submissions shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Ad Hoc Labs shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute, and exploit such unsolicited information without limitation or attribution.
Information that is Automatically Collected:
We also collect information through automated and technical means as you browse our website, use our mobile applications, or otherwise use our Services.
Device and Online Usage Information.
Like most providers of websites and mobile applications, when you interact with our Services, we receive and store certain information that is collected passively using various technologies. This information includes IP address, Media Access Control (MAC) address, device type (e.g., Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language and Internet browser type and version, the pages you view in our Services, pages referring you to our Services, when you use our Services, mobile carrier, time zone, device identifiers (including Apple’s IDFA and Android’s advertising ID), and the sites on which you actively use our Services.
SDKs, Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
.  In operating our Services, we and our service providers also collect data about your use of our Services through the use of a variety of tracking technologies, including SDKs, cookies, tracking pixels, and web server logs, as described below.
We may use SDKs on our mobile applications that leverage identifiers provided in mobile operating systems like iOS and Android to (i) inform, optimize, and serve our marketing to you based on your use of the mobile applications; and (ii) provide analytics on the performance of our marketing.
We may use cookies, tracking pixels and, webserver logs for the same general purposes as SDKs, but on our websites, rather than in our mobile applications. Web server logs provide data on how users behave on our website, which allows us to optimize our website performance.

Ad Hoc Labs may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

Notice to Nevada Residents
Under a Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the “sale” of “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons, as those concepts are defined under the Nevada law, which differs from the CCPA. “Personally identifiable information” under that law includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.

Information We Collect About You
In order to provide and improve upon our services and better market our services to customers, we receive and collect information about you in various ways. When you interact with us through our Services, we collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us; when we passively collect information from or about you, such as from your browser or device; and when we collect information about you from third parties. We may combine all of the information we collect from or about you from these various sources.
Information You Provide Directly to Us:
In order for you to use our Services, we may collect limited information about you when you voluntarily provide such information, including your mobile phone number (from which we may derive your mobile carrier). In some other limited cases, we may also collect audio information (such as audio recordings if you do not opt-in to voicemail customization or speech-to-text requests). In some other limited cases, we may also collect your name, postal address, email address,
payment information (through our payment processors), and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. Wherever Ad Hoc Labs collects personal information, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. We will use, transfer and disclose this information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Unsolicited submissions such as ideas that you submit for new products or modifications to existing products, and any other unsolicited submissions shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Ad Hoc Labs shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute, and exploit such unsolicited information without limitation or attribution.
Information that is Automatically Collected:
We also collect information through automated and technical means as you browse our website, use our mobile applications, or otherwise use our Services.
Device and Online Usage Information.
Like most providers of websites and mobile applications, when you interact with our Services, we receive and store certain information that is collected passively using various technologies. This information includes IP address, Media Access Control (MAC) address, device type (e.g., Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language and Internet browser type and version, the pages you view in our Services, pages referring you to our Services, when you use our Services, mobile carrier, time zone, device identifiers (including Apple’s IDFA and Android’s advertising ID), and the sites on which you actively use our Services.
SDKs, Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
.  In operating our Services, we and our service providers also collect data about your use of our Services through the use of a variety of tracking technologies, including SDKs, cookies, tracking pixels, and web server logs, as described below.
We may use SDKs on our mobile applications that leverage identifiers provided in mobile operating systems like iOS and Android to (i) inform, optimize, and serve our marketing to you based on your use of the mobile applications; and (ii) provide analytics on the performance of our marketing.
We may use cookies, tracking pixels and, webserver logs for the same general purposes as SDKs, but on our websites, rather than in our mobile applications. Web server logs provide data on how users behave on our website, which allows us to optimize our website performance. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access our Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to our Services and help us analyze usage of Services more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access our Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once when using our Services. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or emails, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks and measure popularity of our Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. We and our service providers may also include Web beacons in email messages, newsletters and other electronic communications to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics, personalization and advertising purposes. As we and our service providers adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information about how to control cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g.,
Internet Explorer
;
Google Chrome
;
Mozilla Firefox
; or
Apple Safari
). Please note that by blocking any or all tracking technologies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of our Services.
