Privacy Policy
ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY
Envoy Mortgage, Ltd.
(“Envoy”) recognizes the importance of protecting the confidentiality and security of information that you may choose to provide to us online. We have adopted this Online Privacy Policy to tell you how we collect, store, and use that information. By using any Envoy online or mobile site or application, you consent to this Policy, including your consent to our use and disclosure of information about you in the manner described below.
Why We Need Information About You
We need to know information about you for us to provide you with the mortgage loan products and services you have requested through Envoy’s website. If applying online, that information may include your address, phone number, date of birth, social security number, income, employment, and other personal and financial information necessary to meet Envoy’s and/or investor requirements.
How We Obtain information About You
Most of the information we need to know we collect from you. We also may need to obtain information about you and the proposed transaction from other sources such as consumer reporting agencies, your employer, your bank, and others to make sure that the information is complete and correct. Additionally, when you browse or visit our website, we may store certain information such as the type of device and browser you are using, the IP address of your device, and additional information associated with your device. This information, or “cookies”, facilitates website navigation, tailors the website to your individual preferences, and saves you time when you return to the Envoy website. For example, if a program on the website requires a user ID and/or password, you may have the option of requesting that we save your user ID so you won’t have to enter it the next time you visit the website. A cookie accomplishes this. Cookies, tags and other technologies provide Envoy with the capability to monitor the use of our website so we can continually improve the design and functionality to better serve you. Cookies do not contain or capture unencrypted personally identifiable information.
We also provide certain widgets or tools on our sites, such as tools that allow web surfers to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform. At other times, information from a third party may be embedded on our site, such as a map or information streaming from another site, including communications streaming from a third party social media platform. These widgets, tools, and informational items often function through the use of third party cookies utilized by the third party site, such as the social media platform. You may wish to review information at third party sites, such as social media platforms where you have an account, to determine how these third parties treat data that they obtain through the use of cookies.
How We May Use or Share Your Information
We use the online information you provide or we collect to process your request for services, products, or information; to facilitate your online activities; and to improve our customer service. We may share some of the information we collect about you to third parties, like companies performing services on our behalf, companies providing services or products pursuant to your request, or otherwise as permitted by law. If Envoy shares your information with a company contracted to provide services on our behalf, they are required to protect customer information and only use the information for the purpose of providing the requested services. We do not sell your information. We may also release your information to others when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) protect the rights, property, or safety of Envoy or its employees, or (iii) help prevent fraud, money laundering, terrorism, or other crimes. As applicable, please see
Envoy’s Consumer Privacy Notice
for more information on how we may share information with affiliates and third parties.
For California residents,  you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act. A copy of our California Consumer Privacy Act Policy and Notice of Collection of Personal Information can be viewed on the Envoy website at

How We Protect Your Information
Envoy restricts access to the information obtained from our website to our employees and contractors. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your non-public personal information. Online applications are maintained on a secure server. While we strive to protect your personal information, we do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us in a non-secure environment, such as within or attached to an e-mail.
Children’s Privacy
From our web pages, we do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable consent from their parents. For more information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), visit the FTC website: www.ftc.gov.
Linking to Other Sites
We may provide links to the websites of other companies. If you choose to link to these websites, we are not responsible for the privacy or security of these websites, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability or suitability of their information. We recommend you carefully review the privacy policies of any website requesting your information.
Email
Email transmitted across the Internet is normally not protected and may be intercepted and viewed by others. Therefore, you should refrain from sending any confidential or private information via unsecured email to Envoy. We will not ask you to send confidential information to us via email, such as your account numbers or Social Security number. You should use Hightail which provides email encryption at Envoy. Contact your loan originator for information on how to use Hightail to send confidential information to Envoy.
