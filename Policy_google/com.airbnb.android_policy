Non-User DAC7 Privacy Notice
Legal terms • Host
Non-User DAC7 Privacy Notice
Please note that this Notice applies to non-users of Airbnb who reside in the EU, or who receive income from properties/experiences located in the EU only.
Airbnb is obliged to collect information about Hosts who are registered users with us, for purposes of complying with tax transparency obligations under EU Directive 2021/514 (
“DAC7”
).
Airbnb sometimes receives information about non-users, as further described in our Privacy Policy. For example, if two individuals co-own a property which is listed on Airbnb, but only one individual is a registered user on the platform, that user might choose to provide us with bank account details for the non-user so that we can split the payments and pay both individuals directly.
In these cases, DAC7 requires Airbnb to disclose certain information about the non-user, which has been  provided to us by the registered Host, such as name and bank account details.
In this article
About DAC7 – why is Airbnb collecting this data?
How do we use a non-user’s information for DAC7 compliance?
What is our legal basis for this processing?
How long will we retain non-user information?
How can non-users exercise their data subject rights?
Operating Globally and International Transfers
Contact Us
About DAC7 – why is Airbnb collecting this data?
DAC7 places a legal obligation on Airbnb to share data with the Irish Revenue Commissioners relating to individuals who offer experiences or rent properties on Airbnb. For this reason, we ask users who are registered Hosts on Airbnb to provide certain tax information, including their name, home address, personal tax number, and the address of the property that is listed on Airbnb.
Registered Hosts on Airbnb are asked not to provide information relating to non-users of Airbnb for the purposes of DAC7 compliance. However, while Airbnb is not required to collect this information about non-users, Airbnb is obliged to disclose to Irish Revenue any relevant information that we hold
. If, for example, Airbnb has already been provided with the name and bank account details of non-users who earn an income through Airbnb, we are obliged to disclose this information to Irish Revenue in order to comply with our legal obligations under DAC7.
How do we use a non-user’s information for DAC7 compliance?
Information provided to Airbnb for DAC7 compliance, including, if applicable, payments information provided in respect of relevant non-users, will be shared with the Irish Revenue Commissioners, every January. The first report will be made by Airbnb in January 2024, in respect of the 2023 calendar year.
Airbnb does not use this information for its own purposes.
What is our legal basis for this processing?
Our legal basis for this processing is in order to comply with a legal obligation, namely DAC7.
How long will we retain non-user information?
Airbnb will retain tax information for as long as required in order to fulfill its obligations under DAC7.
How can non-users exercise their data subject rights?
Data subjects have the right to erase, rectify, access, and port their information. Data subjects have the right to object to processing where this processing is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests.
If you believe that Airbnb is processing data about you, and you do not have an Airbnb account, please visit
this page
to exercise any of these rights.

4.3 Compliance with Law, Responding to Legal Requests, Preventing Harm and Protection of our Rights.
As we reasonably deem appropriate, Airbnb.org may disclose your information or communications, including personal information, to courts, law enforcement, governmental authorities, tax authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with a valid legal request or to respond to claims asserted against Airbnb.org, (iii) to respond to a valid legal request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (vi) investigate potential violations of applicable law, including emergency situations which may involve the risk of death or serious physical harm, (v) to enforce and administer our agreements with users, or (vi) to protect the safety, security, rights, or property of Airbnb.org, its employees, its users, or members of the public.
These disclosures may be necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for the protection of your or another person's vital interests or for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interest in keeping the Airbnb.org services secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, and prevention of tax fraud or preventing damage.
Where appropriate, we may notify users about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Airbnb.org’s property, its users and the Airbnb.org services. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we may attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.
4.4 Service Providers.
In addition to Airbnb providing the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb.org also uses a variety of third-party service providers to help us provide services related to the Airbnb.org programs.

Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Airbnb.org override your own.
