4. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION
4.1
In general, Open English may use information about you to provide and improve its Service. Open English may share this information with the suppliers of content on the service, affiliates and other entities in non-personal form to show general demographic and preference information among users of the Service or for other purposes. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include personal information (such as your email address).
4.2
As part of the Service, Open English may provide you feedback regarding your progress in the form of video messages hosted on third party websites, which messages can be viewed by other users of such third party websites. Although these video messages will not identify you by name or photograph, if you do not wish to receive such feedback, you will have the ability to opt-out of receiving and having such messages hosted on the third party websites.
4.3
If you provide Open English with personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Open English will not disclose, share, sell or rent personally identifiable information collected on our Website to third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-out. If you ask to receive information from our affiliates by selecting this option in the future, we may share your registration information and information regarding your transactions on our Service with the studios and/or our affiliates. If you access our Service using a co-branded version of our Website that contains messaging that information will be shared with that affiliate whose company name is displayed on the co-branded site, any personal or non-personal information collected may be shared with that affiliate. Any use of such information by Open English will be subject to this Privacy Policy and any use of such information by the affiliate will be subject to this Privacy Policy and the affiliate’s privacy policy.

The resulting buyer, surviving company or transferee will honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy. We do not share your credit card account information with Affiliate Sites or any other third parties, other than order processing and credit card clearance service providers as described below.
4.4
In order to keep you informed about our services, we may send e-mails and announcements that are needed for the administration of our Website and Service. We also may provide our users with the option of joining our mailing list to receive additional information about our Website, services and offers, including the services and offers of Open Education LLC or its affiliates. Additionally, we may, from time-to-time, allow you to choose whether you would like to receive mailings from third parties with whom we have affiliate relationships.

We work with third parties who provide services, which may include website hosting, promotion fulfillment, order processing, credit card clearance, data analysis and other services of an administrative nature. Personal information, including financial information, may be shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services to you. We seek to impose confidentiality obligations on such service providers. Also, Open Education LLC, which owns Open English, will be able to use your personal information under the terms of this Privacy Policy. We also reserve the right to disclose personal information to third parties when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, to enforce our Terms of Service, to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of Open English or the public, to respond to an emergency, or as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.
4.6
Following termination or deactivation of your account, Open English, its Affiliates, or its Service Providers may retain information associated with your profile information for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes.
5. SECURITY
5.1
We use reasonable security methods to protect the data that resides on our servers. However, because no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers. It is also possible that information you supply to us will be intercepted during transmission.
5.2
Whenever you give Open English sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers), Open English will take commercially reasonable steps to protect such information by establishing a secure connection with your Web browser. Open English employs an industry standard technology known as a secure-socket-layer (“SSL”) to protect the transmission of payment information to the Website. You can check the security of your connection by looking at the address in your browser window. After you have accessed a secure server protected by SSL, the first characters of the address will change from “http” to “https.”
5.3
Please do your part to help us. To help protect your Open English Account information, please keep your password secure. Your password will be maintained on our system in encrypted form because Open English understands that privacy is important to you. Open English will generate a link to create a new password in case you forget it and send it to the email account you provided. This will not affect your settings in any way. We suggest that you pick a non-obvious password that mixes numbers and letters. In addition, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any Open English Account information.
5.4
Remember to sign out of your Open English Account, and close your browser window whenever you leave your computer. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information, because your computer may be accessible to others or used in a shared setting.
5.5
Open English’s Privacy Policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Open English’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
6. CHAT WITH OUR TEACHERS
During the term of the Course, adults and children will have the opportunity to interact with academic advisors (the “Teachers”) during the online live classes (no image, only voice) available in the Course participating in session, games and activities through a virtual classroom and a chat system. We may employ live moderation and/or encourage users to flag inappropriate communications. We strongly encourage children who use these interactive features on our sites and applications never to provide personal information about themselves or any third party, and certainly never to attempt to circumvent the filters or moderation we may have in place. We also recommend that you as a parent or legal guardian carefully supervise your children while his/her participation in online activities associated with the Course.

EConsistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) as amended from time to time, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without requiring parental consent. Any person who provides their personal information to us through the Service represents that they are 13 years of age or older. Open English does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service.
7.2
The Course activities do not require children to provide any personal information and therefore may not result in notice to the parent or require parental consent. However, in connection with certain activities or services of the Course, we may collect a child’s online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once. On some occasions a child may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to “opt-out” of each communication individually.
7.3
In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA’s requirements, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection.
7.4
For more information please review our Privacy Policy that explains our information collection, disclosure, and practices with respect to information we collect. This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), and outlines our practices in the United States regarding children’s personal information.
8. COPPA
8.1
Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, on any child-targeted site or application, or in any instance where we ask for age and determine the user is age 12 or under, we will ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect any personal information from the child. If you believe your child is participating in an activity that collects personal information and you or another parent/guardian have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking your consent, please feel free to contact us at [We will not use parent emails provided for parental consent purposes to market to the parent, unless the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.
8.2
At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children in association with a particular account or service administered by the Company, and can request that we delete from our records the personal information we have collected in connection with that account. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, license of use, or other service administered by the Company.
8.3
In any correspondence to the Company such as e-mail or mail, please include the child’s username and the parent’s email address and telephone number. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a parent’s identity before granting access to any personal information.
9. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS
9.1
Open English may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Service.

They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.

These other sites may send their own cookies to you, collect data or solicit personal information. Open English cannot guarantee and is not responsible for the content of outside sites.
