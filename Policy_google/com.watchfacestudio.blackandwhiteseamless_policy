Ethan's Watch Face Store - Privacy Policy
Our WatchFaces are designed solely for the purpose of displaying the time and customizable complications on Wear OS devices. No personal information is required to use our apps. Our WatchFaces
      do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users.
Your permission is required for displaying the data that is already on your watch, such as Step Count and Heart Rate. This data is not collected or stored by our apps, but rather accessed
      directly by the watch faces when you grant permission to display it.
We value the privacy and security of our users and strive to protect their personal information at all times. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please don't
      hesitate to
