PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE AND CONSENTS
You understand and agree that, by establishing an account with Nav, or submitting or enrolling for any Service, you have provided “written instructions” in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended (“FCRA”), for Nav to obtain your credit report and/or credit score(s) on a recurring basis to provide them to you while you have an account with Nav, and such information may be obtained from Experian Information Solutions, Inc., TransUnion, LLC, and/or Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.

You understand and agree that Nav may, from time to time, provide additional products, services, features, and/or functionality to you, and that they shall be offered pursuant to the same authorization that you provided to Nav for Nav to obtain your credit report and/or credit score(s) on a recurring basis to provide them to you to review while you have an account with Nav.
You further understand and agree that, by establishing an account with Nav, or submitting your order or enrolling for any Service, you have provided “written instructions” in accordance with the FCRA for Nav to obtain and use the information you have provided, and your credit report(s) and/or score(s) to notify you of credit opportunities and other products and services that may be available to you through Nav or through unaffiliated third parties (as explained in the section below entitled “General Description of Services”). You understand and agree that Nav receives compensation for the marketing of credit opportunities or other products or services available through third parties, and that this compensation may impact how and where such credit opportunities, products or services appear on a Website (including, for example, the order in which they appear).
AMENDMENTS
This Agreement may be updated from time to time. Online customers should check this website regularly for updates to this Agreement and the included Terms and Conditions. Each time you order, access or use any of the Services and Websites, you signify your acceptance and agreement, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by the then current Agreement and included Terms and Conditions.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
The Services and Websites are meant to provide you a means to review your personal and business finance and/or credit information for educational purposes only, and to manage if and to the extent you so choose, and may notify you of commercial credit opportunities and other products and services that may be available to you and your business entity through Nav or through third parties (such as, among other things, advertisements or offers for available credit cards, loan options, business products or services, or credit related products or services and other offers to you and/or your business entity, the ability to track and collect certain credit information specific to you and/or your business entity, including but not limited to, credit score, loan and credit card monthly payment, total amount and interest rates). The Services and Websites are meant for you and your business’s use only. The Services and Websites may also provide you other third-party products or services. This includes receiving offers free of charge for various credit or other financial products or services based upon your self-identified credit attributes, the attributes of your business entity (and/or your consumer report and credit score and business entity’s commercial credit report and score). These offers may also be generic and may not contain offers based on information specific to you or your business entity.
We will identify those Services that are provided to you free of charge. Some of the Services (including Premium and Premium Plus) require a fee at the time of Service purchase or enrollment. By purchasing such Services and providing payment information, you represent that you are authorized to utilize the payment method presented and agree to pay the specified fee for paid Services, including any method offered or used through a mobile application. Furthermore, you agree and authorize Nav to: (i) submit a transaction using the card information provided, (ii) in the case of automatic recurring transactions, submit a transaction on a recurring basis (e.g. monthly or annual basis) for membership renewals.
If at any time while you have a paid account with Nav, you may choose to downgrade your membership to a different Service plan, including a free Service. You may downgrade your account by contacting Customer Support or by using any other method specified on the Websites. For the sake of clarity, downgrading your account will not cancel your membership. To cancel your account in its entirety and no longer receive Services you must call Customer Support, or downgrade your plan in the
account settings
on the Website. In all events, your account with Nav, (including your access to and use of any Services and Websites, and regardless of whether you upgrade or downgrade any Services while maintaining your account), shall be governed by this Agreement and these Terms and Conditions.
You acknowledge and agree that Nav (including its Services and/or Websites) has not and does not provide you or your business entity, legal, tax, financial, or other advice (including, without limitation, advice on how to improve or repair your credit or credit scores), and that its Services and/or Websites are not designed or intended to provide any such advice. As discussed above, and for your convenience, we may provide various other third-party websites that may be of interest to you. The third party offers or links that may be displayed on a Website are from third party companies from which Nav may receive compensation. Compensation may impact how, where or whether a third party product, service or link appears on a Website. Further, Nav does not represent, warrant or guarantee approval of any loan offer or service offered by a third party on any Website or other benefit should you choose to apply for a particular offer. Any suggestion or representation of possible approval are for illustrative purposes only and may vary based on your individual and business entity’s financial circumstances and the terms made available to you by the applicable issuer or lender. Nav disclaims all liability for any errors or omissions in any express or implied suggestions or representations related to possible approvals or benefits made by Nav or its marketing partners. For complete information on any particular offer, see the terms and conditions on the issuer or lender’s website. Once you click apply for any offers, you will be directed to the issuer or lender’s website where you may review the terms and conditions of the applicable opportunity or offer before applying.
While Nav uses reasonable efforts to present the most accurate information, we show a summary to help you choose a third party service, not the full legal terms. Nav does not control or endorse such websites and is not responsible for their content, nor is it responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information, data, opinions, offers, advice, or statements contained within such websites, nor can Nav guarantee your and/or your business entity’s eligibility to take advantage of any of the information, data, opinions, offers, advice or statements contained within those websites. Please carefully read the terms and conditions or terms of use policies of any other third party company or website you may link to from our Websites. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the Websites, you do so at your own risk. Nav reserves the right to terminate any link or linking program at any time. Nav disclaims all warranties, express and implied, as to the accuracy, validity, and legality or otherwise of any materials or information contained on such third party websites.
Subscription payments to Nav may be represented as a “tradeline” on your Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax business credit report. You may see these tradelines are reporting as “Other” on your reports.
MODIFICATION OF PRODUCTS
Nav may, at its discretion, modify or discontinue any of the Products, Product Websites or Content, or any portion thereof, with or without notice. You agree that Nav will not be liable to you, your minor children or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of any of the Products, Product Websites or Content.
USE OF THE SERVICES
In consideration of your order of, access to, and/or use of any Services and/or Websites you agree to provide true, accurate, complete and current information about yourself and any business entity you are enrolling, or have enrolled, in any Service, when prompted to do so by the registration and application forms or when requested to do so by Nav. By registering, you certify that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older. If any information you provide is untrue, fraudulent, inaccurate or not current, or if Nav has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is, fraudulent, not current, or intended for misuse, Nav, at its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your order of, use of, and/or access to, any Service and/or Website, and refuse all current or future orders of, use of, and/or access to, Service and/or Website, or suspend or terminate any portion thereof. In the event that Nav suspends or terminates your order of, use of, and/or access to, any Service and/or Website for any purpose other than fraud or misuse, Nav will allow access to retrieve your records and data for 5 business days prior to shut-off.
Further, you agree that Nav will not be liable to you, any business entity you are or have enrolled, or any third party if Nav suspends or terminates your order of, use of, or access to any Service and/or Websites, or any portion thereof, for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that Nav may, in its sole discretion, retain any information you provided to it or generated by Nav (or its affiliates/suppliers, including but not limited to Experian, TransUnion and Dun & Bradstreet) while you have an account with Nav, including any information about you and any credit card or payment or other information obtained in connection with your account and/or the provision of any Service. If Nav does retain any such information, you acknowledge it is not obligated to retain that information for any specified period of time.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
SUMMARY:
MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CONTACTING NAV´S CUSTOMER SUPPORT DEPARTMENT AT HTTPS://NAV.COM/CONTACT. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT NAV´S CUSTOMER SUPPORT DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAY HAVE TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF NAV HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IT HAS WITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. IN ARBITRATION, BOTH THE PREVAILING PARTY WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS´ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY.
Arbitration Agreement:
(a) Nav and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. It includes, but is not limited to:
claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute (including, without limitation, the Credit Repair Organizations Act) fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to “Nav,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products or information under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Nav are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Nav should be addressed to: Legal & Compliance, Nav, 13693 S 200 W, Suite 200 Draper, UT 84020 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief you seek from Nav (“Demand”). If Nav and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Nav may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Nav or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Nav is entitled.
You may obtain more information about arbitration from
www.adr.org
.
(c) After Nav receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, Nav will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement´s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Unless Nav and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Nav will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Nav for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
(d) The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding or in the final award, pursuant to applicable law and the AAA Rules.
(e) Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
(f) YOU AND NAV AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Nav agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
(g) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Nav makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your membership in any credit monitoring or other product, you may reject any such change and require Nav to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises regarding such membership product.
FCRA DISCLOSURES
The FCRA allows you to obtain a copy of all of the information in your consumer credit file disclosure from any consumer credit reporting company for a reasonable charge. The FCRA also states that individuals are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer credit reporting company free of charge under the following circumstances:
You have been denied credit, insurance or employment in the past 60 days as a result of your report
You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the day you make the certification
You are a recipient of public welfare assistance
You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud
The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate information in their consumer credit report without charge. Accurate information cannot be changed. You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from Nav to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your consumer credit file or to receive a copy of your consumer disclosure.
The credit report you are requesting from Nav is not intended to constitute the disclosure of consumer credit information required by the FCRA or similar state laws. Such consumer disclosures must be obtained directly from one or all of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, Transunion).
The FCRA allows consumers to get one free comprehensive disclosure of all of the information in their credit file from each of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax®, and TransUnion®) once every 12 months through a central source. Georgia residents can receive two disclosures per year. Although comprehensive, the credit reports from one or all of the three national credit reporting companies that are available from Nav may not have the same information as a credit report obtained directly from the three national credit reporting companies or through the central source. To request your free annual report under the FCRA, you must go to www.annualcreditreport.com, or call 877-322-8228. Nav’s Products are not related to the free FCRA disclosure that you are or may be entitled to.
Consumers Have The Right To Obtain A Security Freeze
You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.
As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer’s credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer’s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer’s identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.
A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.
TERRITORIAL RESTRICTIONS
The Services made available through the Websites are intended for use by U.S. users only. We make no representation or warranties that the information, products or services provided through the Services or the Websites are appropriate for access or use in other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the above, we reserve the right to limit the availability of the Services or the provision of any Services to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, including within the United States, at any time and in our sole discretion.
NOTICE OF PROSECUTION
Your access to and use of password protected and/or secure areas of the Product Websites are restricted to authorized users only. Unauthorized individuals attempting to access these areas of the Product Websites may be subject to prosecution.
Failure to comply with the FCRA can result in state or federal enforcement actions, as well as private lawsuits. In addition, any person who knowingly and willfully obtains a consumer credit report or disclosure under false pretenses may face criminal prosecution.
SECURITY MEASURES AND AUTHENTICATION
Because Nav uses security measures designed to protect your privacy and to safeguard your information, Nav may not always be able to successfully provide Products to you, including instant online delivery of your credit report for online customers. For example, for certain online Products, when the system is unable to authenticate you, you may be routed through a manual authentication process. In the event that you are routed through a manual authentication process, it is your responsibility to complete authentication so that you can gain access to your membership on the website. Your membership will continue and we will continue to monitor your credit report, all of which will be available to you once you complete authentication. Consequently, you will continue to be billed for your membership and the associated services available to you until you downgrade to a free Service or cancel. For certain products, Nav cannot offer a manual authentication process and will be unable to fulfill your order if you fail online authentication one or more times.

Nav offers access to your credit report, your VantageScore 3.0®, and other credit information. Nav and its affiliates are not credit repair organizations, and are not offering to sell, provide or perform any service to you for the express or implied purpose of either improving your credit record, credit history or credit rating or providing advice or assistance to you with regard to improving your credit record, credit history or credit rating. You acknowledge and agree that you are not seeking to purchase, use, or access any of the Products, Product Websites, and Content in order to do so.
Accurate adverse information on your credit report cannot be changed. If you believe that your credit report contains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is your responsibility to contact the relevant credit reporting company, and follow the appropriate procedures for notifying the credit reporting company that you believe that your credit report contains an inaccuracy. Any information provided to you regarding the procedures followed by the various credit reporting companies related to the removal of inaccurate, non-fraudulent information is provided without charge to you and is available for free. Any such information is not included as part of your credit score monitoring product but is provided free of charge to all consumers, regardless of whether they are members of the credit score monitoring product.
VantageScore 3.0®
The VantageScore, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by VantageScore Solutions, LLC to help you see and understand how lenders view your credit worthiness. It is not a FICO score and is not usually used by lenders, but it is indicative of your overall credit risk. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you´ll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Your credit score is based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested. Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your credit score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. And since the information in your file can change over time, your credit score may be different from day-to-day.
Lenders and insurers use several different credit scoring models so don’t be surprised if your lender gives you a score that´s different from the VantageScore 3.0 you receive online. Just remember that your associated risk level is generally the same even if the number is not. If the lender´s score is lower than your online score, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.

The Services and Websites are meant to provide you a means to review your personal and business finance and/or credit information for educational purposes only, and to manage if and to the extent you so choose, and may notify you of commercial credit opportunities and other products and services that may be available to you and your business entity through Nav or through third parties (such as, among other things, advertisements or offers for available credit cards, loan options, business products or services, or credit related products or services and other offers to you and/or your business entity, the ability to track and collect certain credit information specific to you and/or your business entity, including but not limited to, credit score, loan and credit card monthly payment, total amount and interest rates).

This includes receiving offers free of charge for various credit or other financial products or services based upon your self-identified credit attributes, the attributes of your business entity (and/or your consumer report and credit score and business entity’s commercial credit report and score). These offers may also be generic and may not contain offers based on information specific to you or your business entity.
We will identify those Services that are provided to you free of charge. Some of the Services (including Premium and Premium Plus) require a fee at the time of Service purchase or enrollment.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
SUMMARY:
MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CONTACTING NAV´S CUSTOMER SUPPORT DEPARTMENT AT HTTPS://NAV.COM/CONTACT. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT NAV´S CUSTOMER SUPPORT DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAY HAVE TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF NAV HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IT HAS WITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. IN ARBITRATION, BOTH THE PREVAILING PARTY WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS´ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY.
Arbitration Agreement:
(a) Nav and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. It includes, but is not limited to:
claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute (including, without limitation, the Credit Repair Organizations Act) fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to “Nav,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products or information under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Nav are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Nav should be addressed to: Legal & Compliance, Nav, 13693 S 200 W, Suite 200 Draper, UT 84020 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief you seek from Nav (“Demand”). If Nav and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Nav may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Nav or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Nav is entitled.
You may obtain more information about arbitration from
www.adr.org
.
(c) After Nav receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, Nav will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement´s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Unless Nav and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Nav will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Nav for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
(d) The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding or in the final award, pursuant to applicable law and the AAA Rules.
(e) Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
(f) YOU AND NAV AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Nav agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
(g) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Nav makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your membership in any credit monitoring or other product, you may reject any such change and require Nav to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises regarding such membership product.
FCRA DISCLOSURES
The FCRA allows you to obtain a copy of all of the information in your consumer credit file disclosure from any consumer credit reporting company for a reasonable charge. The FCRA also states that individuals are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer credit reporting company free of charge under the following circumstances:
You have been denied credit, insurance or employment in the past 60 days as a result of your report
You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the day you make the certification
You are a recipient of public welfare assistance
You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud
The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate information in their consumer credit report without charge. Accurate information cannot be changed. You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from Nav to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your consumer credit file or to receive a copy of your consumer disclosure.
The credit report you are requesting from Nav is not intended to constitute the disclosure of consumer credit information required by the FCRA or similar state laws. Such consumer disclosures must be obtained directly from one or all of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, Transunion).
The FCRA allows consumers to get one free comprehensive disclosure of all of the information in their credit file from each of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax®, and TransUnion®) once every 12 months through a central source. Georgia residents can receive two disclosures per year. Although comprehensive, the credit reports from one or all of the three national credit reporting companies that are available from Nav may not have the same information as a credit report obtained directly from the three national credit reporting companies or through the central source. To request your free annual report under the FCRA, you must go to www.annualcreditreport.com, or call 877-322-8228. Nav’s Products are not related to the free FCRA disclosure that you are or may be entitled to.
Consumers Have The Right To Obtain A Security Freeze
You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.
As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer’s credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer’s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer’s identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.
A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.

None of our services for which you pay us money, including our credit monitoring services, are offered or provided with respect to the extension of credit by third parties. You are paying us only for credit monitoring services. You are not paying us to advise you or assist you in obtaining a loan or improving your credit record, history, rating or Score. Nav offers access to your credit report, your VantageScore 3.0®, and other credit information. Nav and its affiliates are not credit repair organizations, and are not offering to sell, provide or perform any service to you for the express or implied purpose of either improving your credit record, credit history or credit rating or providing advice or assistance to you with regard to improving your credit record, credit history or credit rating. You acknowledge and agree that you are not seeking to purchase, use, or access any of the Products, Product Websites, and Content in order to do so.
Accurate adverse information on your credit report cannot be changed. If you believe that your credit report contains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is your responsibility to contact the relevant credit reporting company, and follow the appropriate procedures for notifying the credit reporting company that you believe that your credit report contains an inaccuracy. Any information provided to you regarding the procedures followed by the various credit reporting companies related to the removal of inaccurate, non-fraudulent information is provided without charge to you and is available for free. Any such information is not included as part of your credit score monitoring product but is provided free of charge to all consumers, regardless of whether they are members of the credit score monitoring product.
VantageScore 3.0®
The VantageScore, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by VantageScore Solutions, LLC to help you see and understand how lenders view your credit worthiness. It is not a FICO score and is not usually used by lenders, but it is indicative of your overall credit risk. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you´ll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Your credit score is based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested. Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your credit score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. And since the information in your file can change over time, your credit score may be different from day-to-day.
Lenders and insurers use several different credit scoring models so don’t be surprised if your lender gives you a score that´s different from the VantageScore 3.0 you receive online. Just remember that your associated risk level is generally the same even if the number is not. If the lender´s score is lower than your online score, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.
REGISTERING FOR ANY PRODUCT
To request a credit report or score, or purchase any Product, you must have an address within the United States, provide a valid Social Security number, address, email address and date of birth and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.

Without your permission, we do not allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information (PII) about a user’s online activities, over time and across different sites, services, and applications, when that user uses our site, service, or application. PII that you have given permission to be collected may be retrieved, reviewed, and deleted at your request, by contacting Nav.
Non-Personal information. When you visit the Site, we may collect non-personal information, such as a catalog of the Site pages you visit. Non-personal information is generally collected through the Site from the following sources: server log files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.
Server Log Files. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site’s servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.
Environmental Variables. We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.
Cookies and Similar Technologies.We, our service providers, and/or non-affiliated Third-parties, may use “cookies” or similar technologies on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by many websites, and can facilitate your ongoing access to and use of a particular website; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer. At this time we do not respond to ‘Do Not Track’ signals.
Pixel Tags. We, our service providers, and/or non-affiliated Third-parties, may also use so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, to provide online advertising, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.
Information That You Voluntarily Provide. We also collect non-personal information (e.g., your geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is not combined with any personal information, such information is considered to be non-personal information, as it does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate personal information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered non-personal information for purposes of this Policy.
If you are based in the United States, Nav may use Plaid, Inc. (“Plaid”) to connect your Nav account with your bank account, verify your bank account and confirm your bank account balance prior to approving a transaction. Information shared with Plaid is treated by Plaid in accordance with its Privacy Policy, available at
