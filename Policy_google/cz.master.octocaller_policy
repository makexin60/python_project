California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
        privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United
        States (and conceivably in the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from
        California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
        collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. Get more
        information

.
According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
Users can visit our site anonymously.
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum on the first
            significant page after entering our website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy
        Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection
        agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
        protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.
Fair Information Practices
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts
        they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
        Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
        with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue
        legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
        requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have
        recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
CAN-SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
        messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
        penalties for violations.
We collect your email address in order to:
Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
Process orders, send information and updates pertaining to orders.
We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.

            occurred.

What we do when user accept rights in onboarding?
When user enters in Numbo for the first he must accept several rights, which are needed for full usage of Numbo. With acceptation user agrees with:
Access to phone calls logs and contacts.
Numbo is a call blocking app that is used for number identification and blocking.
                We need access to phone call logs and contacts to be able to fully identify users numbers. User can see if the number is trustworthy,
                suspicious or scam. User can make or manage these calls and give them proper status.
Access to call log visibility.
As mentioned above Numbo is a call blocking app. On the main screen we are showing user call log,
                where is possible to see a number detail. We donâ€™t upload any users data to our server. Call log is crucial for number
                identification for each user.
Identification.
Number identification is one of the key features in Numbo. It helps to block unsolicited call.
                User can block new number, number from call log or from contacts. When blacklisting is used it uploads report to our server.
Number identification.
During number identification our servers detects, if the number is local. It sends request to our
                server about number identification. In this case we upload user incoming call to be able to detect number status mentioned in part 1.
                Then we identify number in user contact, identification list, if the number must be blocked or if its own number.
Identification synchronization.
If the user is registered. His number identification history is uploaded on our server.
                Afterwards he is able to transfer his identification history to another device.
