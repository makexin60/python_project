We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so, such as consent, contractual necessity, or our legitimate interests.
Information You Provide to Us
We receive and store information you enter into the Service or provide to us in any way. This may include information necessary for using the Universal Catalog API or generating estimates through the Handoff service. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take full advantage of our Services.
It is your responsibility to ensure that you have shared the proper information with us and that you have obtained the proper consent from your contacts to share their information with us, especially when using the Handoff service to generate estimates for your customers.
Data Sharing and Disclosure
We share Personal Data with vendors and service providers who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. These parties include:
Payment processors;
Fraud prevention service providers;
Analytics service providers;
Hosting service providers;
Other service providers who assist us in providing the Services.
We also share Personal Data when necessary to complete a transaction initiated or authorized by you or provide you with a product or service you have requested. This includes sharing information with other users when you use the Handoff service to generate and share estimates. As a contractor using our Handoff service, you are responsible for obtaining necessary permissions from your clients before sharing their data with us. Please refer to the "Contractor Responsibilities" section for more details.
We may also share Personal Data when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable law, enforce our terms of service, or protect our rights, property, or safety.
Voice-to-Text Feature
We collect and process audio recordings when you use our voice-to-text feature. By agreeing to these terms and using Handoff, you agree that you are opting into usage of the voice-to-text feature in the Handoff service, you consent to the collection and processing of your audio recordings for transcription purposes and understand that the audio recordings will be sent to a third-party speech-to-text API provider for transcription. Audio recordings are stored on our servers after transcription is complete and is used for quality control and improvement of our transcription services.
When you use the voice-to-text feature, your audio is recorded and sent to our third-party speech-to-text API providers (currently Google’s Speech to Text API and OpenAI's Whisper API) for transcription. After transcription, the text is sent back to our servers and stored in your account. We may use the recordings to improve transcription accuracy for project descriptions and AI editing instructions and to analyze audio details (e.g., session length, pauses, hesitations, repetitions) to identify challenges in creating project descriptions. Audio recordings may also be used to train AI models to assist with contractor-client conversations for estimating, call answering, client outreach, and document management.
You have the right to request deletion of your audio recordings and may do so by contacting us at
support@handoff.ai
for such requests.
How long do we retain your Audio Data?
We retain Audio Data for 12 months from the date of collection. However, if you use features that depend on historical audio data, then we may retain the relevant Audio Data longer to maintain these features.
If you request data deletion or do not consent to audio data collection, please note that certain features and products may become unavailable or function with reduced capabilities. These may include voice recognition, personalized responses, and other audio-dependent features.
