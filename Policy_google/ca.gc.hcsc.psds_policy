Additional Information
Privacy Notice
The Government of Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada are committed to providing Web sites that respect the privacy of visitors. This privacy notice summarizes the privacy practices for the Public Health Agency's online activities.
All personal information collected by this institution is governed by the
Privacy Act
. This means that you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.
Your Privacy and the Internet
The nature of the Internet is such that Web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a Web site, including the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, the Government of Canada considers the IP address to be personal information, particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when visitor requests a Web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of the visit.
Unless otherwise noted, the Public Health Agency does not automatically gather any specific information from you, such as your name, telephone number or email address. The Public Health Agency would obtain this type of information only if you supply it to us, for example, by email or by filling in a contact form. In such cases, how your personal information is handled will be provided in a Personal Information Collection Statement.
In cases where services are provided by organizations outside of the Government of Canada, such as social media platforms or mobile applications, IP addresses may be recorded by the Web server of the third-party service provider.
Communicating with the Government of Canada
If you choose to send the Public Health Agency an email or complete a feedback form online, your personal information is used by the Public Health Agency in order to respond to your inquiry. The information you provide will only be shared with another government institution if your inquiry relates to that institution. The Public Health Agency does not use the information to create individual profiles nor does it disclose the information to anyone other than to those in the federal government who need to provide you with a response. Any disclosure of your personal information is in accordance with the
Privacy Act
.
Emails and other electronic methods used to communicate with the Government of Canada are not secure unless it is specifically stated on a Web page. Therefore, it is recommended that you

Digital Markers (including cookies)
A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors' browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the Web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the Web site. Examples of digital markers are "cookies" or HTML5 web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:
they allow a Web site to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the site;
they track what information is viewed on a site which helps Web site administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking for.
The Public Health Agency uses sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of its Web site. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with the Public Health Agency's Web server. The digital markers used do not allow the Public Health Agency to identify individuals.
You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with the Public Health Agency's Web site.
Web Analytics
Web analytics is the collection, analysis, measurement, and reporting of data about Web traffic and visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage. Information in digital markers may be used for the purpose of web analytics to remember your online interactions with the Public Health Agency's Web site.
The Public Health Agency uses Google Analytics to improve its web site. When your computer requests a Public Health Agency Web page, our institution collects the following types of information for Web analytics:
the originating IP address
the date and time of the request
the type of browser used
the page(s) visited
The Public Health Agency uses Google Analytics and the information collected is disclosed to Google, an external third party service provider. Your IP address is anonymized prior to being stored on the service provider's servers in order to help safeguard your privacy. The information collected is de-personalized by activating the anonymization feature in Google Analytics.
Data collected for Web analytics purposes goes outside of Canada to the United States of America and may be subject to the governing legislation of that country, such as the
USA Patriot Act
.
Information used for the purpose of Web analytics is collected pursuant to the
Department of Health Act
, the
Public Health Agency of Canada Act
and statutes for which the Minister of Health is responsible. Such data may be used for communications and information technology statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting. For more information on how your privacy is safeguarded in relation to web analytics, see the
Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics
.

This software receives and records the IP address of the computer that has contacted our Web site, the date and time of the visit and the pages visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected.
This information is collected pursuant to
section 161 of the
Financial Administration Act

The Skills Online program is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information. This Privacy Statement explains the current information management practices on our Web sites. This statement uses the federal Privacy Act (PA) as its foundation and legal basis. However, for a comprehensive policy on privacy, the Canadian Standard Association's principles on privacy are adhered to where possible.
Our commitment - The Skills Online program is fully committed to protecting the information that is gathered as a result of your participation in our online modules and also respects your privacy. Your personal information is protected under the federal Privacy Act, which means that you have the right to be informed of why your personal information is being collected. You can also challenge the accuracy of the information we have about you in our files.
Purpose, collection and use of information - The Skills Online program provides access to online modules to front line public health practitioners in Canada. This online professional continuing education program contributes to improving the public health infrastructure across Canada by developing a highly skilled public health workforce who are able to respond to current and emerging threats to health across Canada. As such, the information you provide when you register for a module serves the following purposes:
Program administration:
Your registration information provides a means to uniquely identify you as an individual who has registered and completed our modules.
Mobilizing the public health workforce:
This makes it possible to identify public health practitioners across Canada who have developed knowledge, skills and attitudes in specific areas through the
Skills Online
program. In a public health emergency, provinces/territories and local organizations will be able to mobilize effective public health human resources and respond to public health crises.
Identify points of contact:
Screened and subsequently eligible participants can consult other participants or program champions from their region and/or province/territory in order to gather information on the Skills Online modules, resources and local implementation.
Program evaluation:
Your contact information allows us to periodically seek participant feedback on module content, processes and program impacts in order to continuously improve the program.
Information collected from participants will be used by the
Skills Online
program only for the purposes identified above.
Limiting collection - We shall not collect personal information indiscriminately. You are not monitored upon visiting our Web site. The information collected shall be limited to that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified above. The personal information collected will be limited to the data requested for registration on our Web site. Program elements such as email, online chat and discussion boards will not be shared outside of the program.
Information sharing, disclosure and retention - Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as allowed or required by law. Personal information will not be disclosed to persons or organization(s) outside the Skills Online program unless it pertains to items 2, through 4 of Identifying Purpose, Collection and Use, or unless it is in accordance with section 8(2) of the Privacy Act. Personal information will only be shared with provincial/territorial and federal government public health agencies and organizations in the event of a public health crisis and subsequent human resource mobilization to respond to such crises.
We realize that participants will always have a need to access their grades for the modules they have taken. We have an obligation to be able to provide this information.
Data integrity - The Skills Online program processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected. We review our information collection, storage and registration practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information necessary to access and improve our program. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process at registration is complete, but we also depend on our participants to update and correct their personal information when necessary, by contacting us.
Information security - We take appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized access and disclosure of your personal information. The information collected will only be accessed by Skills Online program employees and third party administrator. The third party administrator handles participant registration and administers the modules on behalf of the Skills Online program. If you have any questions or concerns in regards to our administrator and this policy, please do not hesitate to contact us. Generally speaking, no other parties external to the Public Health Agency of Canada and the third party administrator will have access to your information unless required by law. All individuals having access to the information will be security cleared at the Enhanced Reliability Level. The Skills Online program, along with the third party administrator uses security safeguards to protect your information such as the use of unique User IDs and passwords. These security safeguards also include the use of security software and encryption protocols and involve physical, technical and procedural controls to protect your personal information.
Openness and individual access - The Skills Online program encourages everyone that participates in the modules to be informed about our information practices. You may contact us if you have any concerns in this regard. You may at any time verify the information we have on file for you and correct any information that is not up to date.
Challenging compliance - An individual shall be able to address an administrative challenge concerning compliance and adherence to the above principles. If such an administrative process does not sufficiently address the issue, a formal request can be made under the Privacy Act or Access to Information Act or a formal complaint can be registered through the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which will result in an official investigation.

This criteria applies to all of the Public Health Agency of Canada's Web sites.
General parameters governing linking
The Public Health Agency of Canada reserves the right to refuse to post a link, to refuse to renew a link, or to terminate an existing link without prior notice due to non-compliance with the criteria mentioned below or for any other appropriate reason which may include, but is not restricted to site navigation or content problems or frequent client complaints.

Decisions to post links on this site will also be subject to this criteria:
the content of the site reflects the aims and objectives of the Public Health Agency of Canada and are consistent with its mandate. In some cases, the Public Health Agency of Canada may consider linking to organizations who are related to the overall GoC mandate, as opposed to the individual mandate of the Public Health Agency of Canada.
the creation of a link does not provide unfair competitive advantage through on-line endorsements of third party interests. Links are provided for convenience purposes only and are not an endorsement or rating of the content of the sites to which they are made. Please note that links created within the context of a Collaborative Arrangement are not considered an endorsement or providing an unfair competitive advantage.
the site is not considered inappropriate due to its content or its affiliations.

Interacting With Us on Social Media

We use our social media accounts as an alternative method of sharing the content posted on our Web site and interacting with our stakeholders. By following our social media accounts (by following, liking or subscribing), you can expect to see information about the programs and services we provide.
We understand that the Web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at any time. You should expect to see new content posted Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST/EDT. Our online community managers strive to respond to questions within 8 business hours. If you send or post a question or comment during the weekend, you should expect to receive a message the next business day.

The Government of Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada are committed to providing Web sites that respect the privacy of visitors. This privacy notice summarizes the privacy practices for the Public Health Agency's online activities.
All personal information collected by this institution is governed by the
Privacy Act
. This means that you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.
Your Privacy and the Internet
The nature of the Internet is such that Web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a Web site, including the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual.

Improving your Experience on Government of Canada Web sites
Digital Markers (including cookies)
A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors' browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the Web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the Web site. Examples of digital markers are "cookies" or HTML5 web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:
they allow a Web site to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the site;
they track what information is viewed on a site which helps Web site administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking for.
The Public Health Agency uses sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of its Web site. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with the Public Health Agency's Web server. The digital markers used do not allow the Public Health Agency to identify individuals.
You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with the Public Health Agency's Web site.

The Skills Online program is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information. This Privacy Statement explains the current information management practices on our Web sites. This statement uses the federal Privacy Act (PA) as its foundation and legal basis. However, for a comprehensive policy on privacy, the Canadian Standard Association's principles on privacy are adhered to where possible.
Our commitment - The Skills Online program is fully committed to protecting the information that is gathered as a result of your participation in our online modules and also respects your privacy. Your personal information is protected under the federal Privacy Act, which means that you have the right to be informed of why your personal information is being collected. You can also challenge the accuracy of the information we have about you in our files.
Purpose, collection and use of information - The Skills Online program provides access to online modules to front line public health practitioners in Canada. This online professional continuing education program contributes to improving the public health infrastructure across Canada by developing a highly skilled public health workforce who are able to respond to current and emerging threats to health across Canada. As such, the information you provide when you register for a module serves the following purposes:
Program administration:
Your registration information provides a means to uniquely identify you as an individual who has registered and completed our modules.
Mobilizing the public health workforce:
This makes it possible to identify public health practitioners across Canada who have developed knowledge, skills and attitudes in specific areas through the
Skills Online
program. In a public health emergency, provinces/territories and local organizations will be able to mobilize effective public health human resources and respond to public health crises.
Identify points of contact:
Screened and subsequently eligible participants can consult other participants or program champions from their region and/or province/territory in order to gather information on the Skills Online modules, resources and local implementation.
Program evaluation:
Your contact information allows us to periodically seek participant feedback on module content, processes and program impacts in order to continuously improve the program.
Information collected from participants will be used by the
Skills Online
program only for the purposes identified above.
Limiting collection - We shall not collect personal information indiscriminately. You are not monitored upon visiting our Web site. The information collected shall be limited to that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified above. The personal information collected will be limited to the data requested for registration on our Web site. Program elements such as email, online chat and discussion boards will not be shared outside of the program.
Information sharing, disclosure and retention - Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as allowed or required by law. Personal information will not be disclosed to persons or organization(s) outside the Skills Online program unless it pertains to items 2, through 4 of Identifying Purpose, Collection and Use, or unless it is in accordance with section 8(2) of the Privacy Act. Personal information will only be shared with provincial/territorial and federal government public health agencies and organizations in the event of a public health crisis and subsequent human resource mobilization to respond to such crises.
We realize that participants will always have a need to access their grades for the modules they have taken. We have an obligation to be able to provide this information.
Data integrity - The Skills Online program processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected. We review our information collection, storage and registration practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information necessary to access and improve our program. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process at registration is complete, but we also depend on our participants to update and correct their personal information when necessary, by contacting us.
Information security - We take appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized access and disclosure of your personal information. The information collected will only be accessed by Skills Online program employees and third party administrator. The third party administrator handles participant registration and administers the modules on behalf of the Skills Online program. If you have any questions or concerns in regards to our administrator and this policy, please do not hesitate to contact us. Generally speaking, no other parties external to the Public Health Agency of Canada and the third party administrator will have access to your information unless required by law. All individuals having access to the information will be security cleared at the Enhanced Reliability Level. The Skills Online program, along with the third party administrator uses security safeguards to protect your information such as the use of unique User IDs and passwords. These security safeguards also include the use of security software and encryption protocols and involve physical, technical and procedural controls to protect your personal information.
Openness and individual access - The Skills Online program encourages everyone that participates in the modules to be informed about our information practices. You may contact us if you have any concerns in this regard. You may at any time verify the information we have on file for you and correct any information that is not up to date.
Challenging compliance - An individual shall be able to address an administrative challenge concerning compliance and adherence to the above principles. If such an administrative process does not sufficiently address the issue, a formal request can be made under the Privacy Act or Access to Information Act or a formal complaint can be registered through the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which will result in an official investigation.

This criteria applies to all of the Public Health Agency of Canada's Web sites.
General parameters governing linking
The Public Health Agency of Canada reserves the right to refuse to post a link, to refuse to renew a link, or to terminate an existing link without prior notice due to non-compliance with the criteria mentioned below or for any other appropriate reason which may include, but is not restricted to site navigation or content problems or frequent client complaints.

Decisions to post links on this site will also be subject to this criteria:
the content of the site reflects the aims and objectives of the Public Health Agency of Canada and are consistent with its mandate. In some cases, the Public Health Agency of Canada may consider linking to organizations who are related to the overall GoC mandate, as opposed to the individual mandate of the Public Health Agency of Canada.
the creation of a link does not provide unfair competitive advantage through on-line endorsements of third party interests. Links are provided for convenience purposes only and are not an endorsement or rating of the content of the sites to which they are made. Please note that links created within the context of a Collaborative Arrangement are not considered an endorsement or providing an unfair competitive advantage.
the site is not considered inappropriate due to its content or its affiliations.

We understand that the Web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at any time. You should expect to see new content posted Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST/EDT. Our online community managers strive to respond to questions within 8 business hours.

Additional Information
Privacy Notice
The Government of Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada are committed to providing Web sites that respect the privacy of visitors. This privacy notice summarizes the privacy practices for the Public Health Agency's online activities.
All personal information collected by this institution is governed by the
Privacy Act
. This means that you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.
Your Privacy and the Internet
The nature of the Internet is such that Web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a Web site, including the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, the Government of Canada considers the IP address to be personal information, particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when visitor requests a Web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of the visit.
Unless otherwise noted, the Public Health Agency does not automatically gather any specific information from you, such as your name, telephone number or email address. The Public Health Agency would obtain this type of information only if you supply it to us, for example, by email or by filling in a contact form. In such cases, how your personal information is handled will be provided in a Personal Information Collection Statement.
In cases where services are provided by organizations outside of the Government of Canada, such as social media platforms or mobile applications, IP addresses may be recorded by the Web server of the third-party service provider.
Communicating with the Government of Canada
If you choose to send the Public Health Agency an email or complete a feedback form online, your personal information is used by the Public Health Agency in order to respond to your inquiry. The information you provide will only be shared with another government institution if your inquiry relates to that institution. The Public Health Agency does not use the information to create individual profiles nor does it disclose the information to anyone other than to those in the federal government who need to provide you with a response. Any disclosure of your personal information is in accordance with the
Privacy Act
.
Emails and other electronic methods used to communicate with the Government of Canada are not secure unless it is specifically stated on a Web page. Therefore, it is recommended that you
do not
send sensitive personal information, such as your Social Insurance Number or your date of birth, through non-secure electronic means.
Personal information from emails or completed feedback forms is collected pursuant to the
Department of Health Act
, the
Public Health Agency of Canada Act
and statutes for which the Minister of Health is responsible. Such information may be used for statistical, evaluation and reporting purposes and is included in Personal Information Bank
Public Communications (PSU 914)
.

Improving your Experience on Government of Canada Web sites
Digital Markers (including cookies)
A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors' browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the Web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the Web site. Examples of digital markers are "cookies" or HTML5 web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:
they allow a Web site to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the site;
they track what information is viewed on a site which helps Web site administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking for.
The Public Health Agency uses sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of its Web site. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with the Public Health Agency's Web server. The digital markers used do not allow the Public Health Agency to identify individuals.
You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with the Public Health Agency's Web site.
Web Analytics
Web analytics is the collection, analysis, measurement, and reporting of data about Web traffic and visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage.

The Skills Online program is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information. This Privacy Statement explains the current information management practices on our Web sites. This statement uses the federal Privacy Act (PA) as its foundation and legal basis. However, for a comprehensive policy on privacy, the Canadian Standard Association's principles on privacy are adhered to where possible.
Our commitment - The Skills Online program is fully committed to protecting the information that is gathered as a result of your participation in our online modules and also respects your privacy. Your personal information is protected under the federal Privacy Act, which means that you have the right to be informed of why your personal information is being collected. You can also challenge the accuracy of the information we have about you in our files.
Purpose, collection and use of information - The Skills Online program provides access to online modules to front line public health practitioners in Canada. This online professional continuing education program contributes to improving the public health infrastructure across Canada by developing a highly skilled public health workforce who are able to respond to current and emerging threats to health across Canada. As such, the information you provide when you register for a module serves the following purposes:
Program administration:
Your registration information provides a means to uniquely identify you as an individual who has registered and completed our modules.
Mobilizing the public health workforce:
This makes it possible to identify public health practitioners across Canada who have developed knowledge, skills and attitudes in specific areas through the
Skills Online
program. In a public health emergency, provinces/territories and local organizations will be able to mobilize effective public health human resources and respond to public health crises.
Identify points of contact:
Screened and subsequently eligible participants can consult other participants or program champions from their region and/or province/territory in order to gather information on the Skills Online modules, resources and local implementation.
Program evaluation:
Your contact information allows us to periodically seek participant feedback on module content, processes and program impacts in order to continuously improve the program.
Information collected from participants will be used by the
Skills Online
program only for the purposes identified above.
Limiting collection - We shall not collect personal information indiscriminately. You are not monitored upon visiting our Web site. The information collected shall be limited to that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified above. The personal information collected will be limited to the data requested for registration on our Web site. Program elements such as email, online chat and discussion boards will not be shared outside of the program.
Information sharing, disclosure and retention - Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as allowed or required by law. Personal information will not be disclosed to persons or organization(s) outside the Skills Online program unless it pertains to items 2, through 4 of Identifying Purpose, Collection and Use, or unless it is in accordance with section 8(2) of the Privacy Act. Personal information will only be shared with provincial/territorial and federal government public health agencies and organizations in the event of a public health crisis and subsequent human resource mobilization to respond to such crises.
We realize that participants will always have a need to access their grades for the modules they have taken. We have an obligation to be able to provide this information.
Data integrity - The Skills Online program processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected. We review our information collection, storage and registration practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information necessary to access and improve our program. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process at registration is complete, but we also depend on our participants to update and correct their personal information when necessary, by contacting us.
Information security - We take appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized access and disclosure of your personal information. The information collected will only be accessed by Skills Online program employees and third party administrator. The third party administrator handles participant registration and administers the modules on behalf of the Skills Online program. If you have any questions or concerns in regards to our administrator and this policy, please do not hesitate to contact us. Generally speaking, no other parties external to the Public Health Agency of Canada and the third party administrator will have access to your information unless required by law. All individuals having access to the information will be security cleared at the Enhanced Reliability Level. The Skills Online program, along with the third party administrator uses security safeguards to protect your information such as the use of unique User IDs and passwords. These security safeguards also include the use of security software and encryption protocols and involve physical, technical and procedural controls to protect your personal information.
Openness and individual access - The Skills Online program encourages everyone that participates in the modules to be informed about our information practices. You may contact us if you have any concerns in this regard. You may at any time verify the information we have on file for you and correct any information that is not up to date.
Challenging compliance - An individual shall be able to address an administrative challenge concerning compliance and adherence to the above principles. If such an administrative process does not sufficiently address the issue, a formal request can be made under the Privacy Act or Access to Information Act or a formal complaint can be registered through the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which will result in an official investigation.

Criteria for Hyperlinking to and from the Public Health Agency of Canada Web Sites
The Public Health Agency of Canada's Web sites are aimed at delivering information and services to users that are relevant and applicable to its mandate and that of the Government of Canada (GoC). To this end, the following criteria will be used by the Public Health Agency of Canada to determine the suitability of links to and from its Web sites.
This criteria applies to all of the Public Health Agency of Canada's Web sites.
General parameters governing linking
The Public Health Agency of Canada reserves the right to refuse to post a link, to refuse to renew a link, or to terminate an existing link without prior notice due to non-compliance with the criteria mentioned below or for any other appropriate reason which may include, but is not restricted to site navigation or content problems or frequent client complaints.

Decisions to post links on this site will also be subject to this criteria:
the content of the site reflects the aims and objectives of the Public Health Agency of Canada and are consistent with its mandate. In some cases, the Public Health Agency of Canada may consider linking to organizations who are related to the overall GoC mandate, as opposed to the individual mandate of the Public Health Agency of Canada.
the creation of a link does not provide unfair competitive advantage through on-line endorsements of third party interests. Links are provided for convenience purposes only and are not an endorsement or rating of the content of the sites to which they are made. Please note that links created within the context of a Collaborative Arrangement are not considered an endorsement or providing an unfair competitive advantage.
the site is not considered inappropriate due to its content or its affiliations.

preference may be given to sites that make their information available in both official languages.
preference may be given to sites that meet the accessibility requirements outlined in
Standard on Web Accessibility

preference may be given to sites that provide uninterrupted, free access to users.
Links to the Public Health Agency of Canada's Web sites
Generally, GoC institutions encourage third parties to link to the GoC. Sites wishing to link to the Public Health Agency of Canada's Web site, therefore, do not need to request permission to do so. We do, however, ask that you follow these linking practices.

Interacting With Us on Social Media
This notice has been written to explain how the Public Health Agency interacts with the public on social media platforms.
Content and Frequency
We use our social media accounts as an alternative method of sharing the content posted on our Web site and interacting with our stakeholders. By following our social media accounts (by following, liking or subscribing), you can expect to see information about the programs and services we provide.
We understand that the Web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at any time. You should expect to see new content posted Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST/EDT. Our online community managers strive to respond to questions within 8 business hours. If you send or post a question or comment during the weekend, you should expect to receive a message the next business day.
Because the servers of social media platforms are managed by a third party, our social media accounts are subject to downtime that may be out of our control. As such, we accept no responsibility for platforms becoming unresponsive or unavailable.
Links to Other Web sites and Ads
Our social media accounts may post or display links or ads for Web sites that are not under our control. These links are provided solely for the convenience of users. The Government of Canada is not responsible for the information found through these links or ads, nor does it endorse the sites or their content.
Following, Liking, Sharing, Subscribing and Retweeting etc.
At this time, the Public Health Agency follows other Government of Canada departments and agencies as well as other institutions, organizations and individuals whom we believe are relevant to the mandate of our work - specifically, as it relates to the health and safety of Canadians. This could include accounts of non-profit organizations and associations.
Our decision to follow, like, share, subscribe to another social media account or message or use other similar features does not imply an endorsement of that account, channel, page or site, and neither does sharing (re-tweeting, reposting or linking to) content from another user. It should also not be taken as an indication of a shift in the department's current official position.
Embedding Videos on Other Websites
The Public Health Agency permits most of its videos to be embedded on other websites by enabling the YouTube Embedded Player. This feature may be disabled at any time without prior notice by the Agency or YouTube. The Agency will not be responsible for any damages resulting from the disabling of such function.

of
Appendix A
of this standard as of January 31, 2013, with the exception of those requirements in section 3 of Appendix 
A, which must be complied with no later than June 30, 2014.
2. Application
2.1 This standard applies to the government institutions defined in

Privacy Act
, including parent Crown 
corporations and any wholly owned subsidiary of these corporations.
2.2 This standard does not apply to the Bank of Canada.

the provisions in Appendix A of this standard.
2.4 This standard applies regardless of which tracking technologies or services are being used for purposes of Web analytics.
3. Context
3.1 Web analytics can be described as the collection, analysis, measurement and reporting of data about Web traffic and 
user visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage.
3.2 Many government institutions are using Web analytics to obtain information about visitors to their websites for two 
main purposes: (i) to better meet the needs of website visitors; and (ii) to assist in delivering effective online services.
3.3 Web analytics tools operate through the collection of information to record a visitor's online interactions with one 
or more Web pages. That information includes, as an example, the Internet Protocol address assigned by an Internet service 
provider to the visitor's computer.
3.4 The
Privacy Act
defines the term "personal information" as meaning "information about an identifiable individual 
recorded in any form." If information collected for Web analytics can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, 
either alone or when combined with other identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, then 
that information will be personal information that must be safeguarded in accordance with the requirements of the
Privacy Act
.
3.5 The Internet Protocol address may, in some circumstances, be linked with an identifiable individual whose computer 
is using that address at any given time. For this reason, the Government of Canada considers the Internet Protocol address 
to be personal information that must, in all cases, be dealt with in accordance with the requirements of the
Privacy Act
.
3.6 Specific requirements for safeguarding the Internet Protocol address, and any other personal information collected 
by government institutions in relation to Web analytics, are set out in Appendix A of this standard.
3.7 If government institutions wish to use Web analytics tools on institutional servers or on servers hosted by third 
parties, they must do so in accordance with the requirements of this standard and any other applicable policy instruments 
and legislation.
3.8 Government institutions must include a Privacy Notice on their websites that meets the requirements described in
Appendix B
of this standard. Such Privacy Notices must also meet the requirements in
sections 6.2.9 and 6.2.10 of the
Directive 
on Privacy Practices
and also the relevant
Terms and Conditions for Privacy Notices in Appendix C of the
Standard on Web 
Usability
, applicable to departments listed in Schedules I, I.1 and II of the
Financial Administration Act
.
3.9 This standard is issued by the President of the Treasury Board pursuant to
