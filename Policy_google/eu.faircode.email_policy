never
be sold or shared in any way.

5. Disclosures of your personal data
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 4 above.
Internal Third Parties as set out in the
Glossary
.
External Third Parties as set out in the
Glossary
.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them.
Third parties to whom we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request, including by the police, tribunals, regulators, the government or related agencies.
6. International transfers
Many of our Internal Third Parties and External Third Parties are based outside the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK. In accordance with applicable data protection laws, we implement measures imposing conditions on the recipient, such as the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, EU standard contractual clauses or declarations by regulators or governments (e.g. adequacy decisions) to ensure that any transferred personal information remains protected and secure and your rights are protected.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.
7. Data security
SECURITY MEASURES
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
8. Data retention
HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see
Request erasure
below for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
9. Your legal rights
You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights, some of which may only apply in certain circumstances:
Request access to your personal data
Request correction of your personal data
Request erasure of your personal data
Object to processing of your personal data
Request restriction of processing your personal data
Request transfer of your personal data
Right to withdraw consent
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please use the
contact form

NO FEEE USUALLY REQUIRED
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU
We will need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
10. Glossary
LAWFUL BASIS
Legitimate Interest
means in your interests, or the interests of our business. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by
contacting us
.
Performance of Contract
means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation
means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.
THIRD PARTIES
Internal third parties
Other companies in the Spamhaus group of companies acting as joint controllers and who are based in Andorra and the United States and provide IT and system administration services and undertake leadership reporting.
External third parties
Service providers acting as processors based in the Netherlands and the US who provide IT and system administration services.
Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.
YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
You have the right to:
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you. We may not provide you with a copy of your personal data if this concerns other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and you want to object to processing on this ground. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. In these situations, we may only process your Personal Information whilst its processing is restricted if we have your consent or are legally permitted to do so, for example for storage purposes, to protect the rights of another individual or company or in connection with legal proceedings.
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. If you would like to withdraw your consent to receiving any direct marketing to which you previously opted-in, you can also do so using our unsubscribe tool.
Complain to a data protection regulator
(which in the UK is the Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO)) if you are concerned about the way we have processed your personal information. Please visit the ICO‚Äôs website for further details.

:
How is my personal data used (not used)? (privacy policy)
This document is not intended to be a complete statement of SpamCop's privacy policy, rather it covers the frequently asked questions.
As a subsidiary of Cisco Systems, Inc., SpamCop is governed by the
Cisco Online Privacy Statement
.
Please consult it for a more thorough legal explanation of our privacy policy.
Detailed description
of how spam report data is used.
Privacy Limitations:
Information you submit in your spam reports is considered to be in the public domain. This information may be shared with others - in fact, that is the entire purpose of SpamCop. SpamCop makes some attempt to conceal the identity of the recipient of the spam, but this method is not foolproof and should not be relied on. All spam reports include a valid email address for you and the IP address which you used to submit the report.
Privacy Protection:
All other information (member data) - member preferences, authorized and blocked email addresses, forwarding addresses, pop accounts and passwords, and of course incoming email - is kept in strict confidence. No other members are permitted to access this data nor are other third parties. Member data may be viewed by an administrator in the process of debugging, development or simple customer assistance, but it will always be held in strict confidence.
Unforseen problems:
It is possible, though unlikely, that through programming error or security breach, member data could become available to outside parties. Although every precaution against this possibility is taken, nothing is 100% and there is always a chance of failure. You can help by picking a good password and keeping it a secret.
Under no circumstances can we be held liable for any type of security breach or programming error, no matter what the impact. This service is provided "as is".

What do we mean by "personal information?"
For us, "personal information" means information which either directly identifies you (like your name, email address, or billing information) or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you (like an account identification number or IP address). We‚Äôll always tell you what personal information we‚Äôre collecting from you. See each product‚Äôs Privacy Notice for specific details.
Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."
If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.
How do we learn information about you?
We learn information about you when:
you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports);
we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when your Firefox browser checks with us to see if it is up to date);
someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when Thunderbird works with your email providers to set up your account); or
when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services).
What do we do with your information once we have it?
When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.
For users in the EU, EEA, Switzerland, and California: see
here
for more information.
When do we share your information with others?
When we have asked and received your permission to share it.
For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.
When we are fulfilling our
mission of being open
. We sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.
When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.
When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.
If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.
How do we store and protect your personal information?
We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.
What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?
We may need to change this policy and our notices.  The updates will be posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums. Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.

When using these services, your texts will not be used to improve the quality of our services.

Terms and Conditions
.
Please note that using DeepL Translator Pro, DeepL API Pro and DeepL Write Pro for the translation or improvement of texts containing personal data of any kind is only permitted if there is a justification for this under data protection law.

We have concluded a data processing agreement with Microsoft and AWS and Microsoft and AWS may only process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes.

6. Creating a DeepL account¬†and Signing up for a DeepL Pro Subscription
6.1 Creating a DeepL account
You have the option of creating a DeepL account. You can use the DeepL Translator or DeepL Write via this account within the applicable
DeepL Account Terms and Conditions
(please see also section
3
). To create the account, the following personal data will be stored:
E-mail address
Password
IP address
We process the email address and password on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR in order to perform the contract of use. Your IP address is processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit.¬†f)¬†GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interests to match your IP address with IP addresses that have misused our service in the past for fraud prevention purposes.
Please note that the creation of a DeepL account is a prerequisite for signing up for and using a DeepL Pro subscription (see section
6.2
), but creating a DeepL account does not oblige you to purchase a paid subscription. Even if you do not sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription after creating the account, the DeepL account remains available and you can use it. You can delete your DeepL account at any time within the account settings or by sending an e-mail with your request to support(at)deepl.com.
If you use your business email address for creating an account with DeepL, we may share this email address with the holder of the company email domain associated with your email address. We will only do this, if the company has legitimate reasons to ask for this data e.g., is interested in purchasing DeepL Pro licenses for the whole company and has confirmed to us that email addresses under their company email domain may only be used for business purposes and may not be used for private purposes. In some cases, sharing of data may also include sharing of usage data associated with your account to allow the company to assess their specific need on DeepL Pro licenses. The sharing of this data is in DeepL's legitimate interest to best support our customers in the acquisition, roll-out and adoption of our paid services, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
If your company uses Single Sign-On (SSO) to log in to DeepL, there is no need for a separate registration with DeepL. When you log in via Single Sign-On your company transmits your email address as well as your first and last name directly to us. We also process this data on the basis of Art.¬†6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.
6.2 Signing up for DeepL Pro
If, after creating a DeepL account, you sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription, additionally the following personal data will be collected and processed for the purposes of concluding and fulfilling the contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR):
First name, surname, and where applicable, company name
Address
Payment details
Tax numbers (where applicable)
Selected subscription option
Possibly other, additional data you provided during the registration process.
Your payment details will also be processed by us if you initially sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription with a free trial period. Despite the free trial period, the processing of your payment details is already necessary at the time of the formation of the contract within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR, as a DeepL Pro subscription is in principle a paid subscription and we only in some cases allow our customers to test our products free of charge for a trial period. However, if no cancellation is made within the aforementioned trial period, the subscription will automatically continue to be subject to payment and the method of payment specified by you will be debited at the time stated in the booking process.
In addition to the aforementioned data, we process further (usage-)data relevant for the provision and billing of our service, such as subscription ID, date and time of the subscription conclusion, billing period, successful payment processing, logins, number of translated or improved characters and documents, upgrades and downgrades. The processing and storage of the aforementioned data is necessary for the conclusion of the contract as well as its performance and is therefore justified according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. If you yourself are not a party to the contract, but DeepL Pro is provided to you, e.g. by your employer or an organization to which you belong, we justify the processing of the data mentioned in section 6.1 and the aforementioned usage data via Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is necessary for the performance of the business relationship with our customers, i.e. your employer or your organization.
We store the data for the duration of the contract term and subsequently, if applicable, for the duration of statutory retention periods, insofar as these prescribe the retention for the respective types of data. We will delete your account if you wish to do so after canceling your subscription. Otherwise, we will maintain your account as DeepL account (see section
6.1
) so that it is available to you¬†in the event of a renewed subscription without you having to register again. This is in your as well as in our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
6.3 Processors involved in the DeepL Pro checkout process
In order to process payments, we forward the necessary payment data to our authorized payment service provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd., Block 4, Harcourt Centre, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2, Ireland (‚ÄúStripe‚Äù). Where necessary, Stripe will transfer the data to Stripe, Inc., located in the USA. Further information on data protection at Stripe and compliance with the requirements of Art. 44 GDPR can be found
here
and
here
. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Stripe, which allows Stripe to process the data solely in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes.
In addition, we use the fraud prevention services of Riskified Ltd, 30 Kalisher St., Tel-Aviv, 6525724, Israel (‚ÄúRiskified‚Äù). Riskified‚Äôs service helps us to detect and analyse fraud in online transactions. This enables us to prevent fraudulent activity and misuse of our services.
When you purchase DeepL Pro services on our website, DeepL may transmit data like your first name, last name, billing address, email address, the DeepL service you booked, its price, your IP address, a truncated form of your payment data (for credit cards this is the BIN, the last four digits of the credit card and the bank issuing the card, for SEPA payments this is the bank code and the last 4 digits from your IBAN) to Riskified for verification purposes. Riskified also directly collects and processes your IP address and information on your device and on your behaviour in our checkout process as well as an identifier via its beacon, a Java script that is implemented in the DeepL check process. Riskified analyses these various data points and provides us with an assessment of whether a transaction is to be considered safe or likely to be fraudulent. More information on the logic typically involved in such an analysis can be found
here
. If Riskified assesses a payment as fraudulent, we may automatically decline your request to subscribe to DeepL Pro. This is justified, because this fraud analysis is necessary for entering into a contract with us. In case you receive an error message, but consider the decision not correct, you can reach out to support(at) deepl.com at any time and one of our support agents will review your case.
We will also feed back user data to Riskified if Riskified has provided us with a positive assessment and we have concluded and executed the contract, but the transaction is subject to a chargeback or the debit on the specified means of payment is not successful after the end of the trial period.
The inclusion of Riskified's fraud prevention services and the related data processing described above is necessary for our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR for the prevention of fraud in order to verify the legitimacy of payments made via DeepL‚Äôs checkout process.
Riskified processes the data we transfer to them and the data they collect in our checkout process for their own purposes. The data may be transferred to the USA. You can find more information about Riskified's handling of personal data here:
https://www.riskified.com/privacy/
.
6.4 Processing of usage data
In your account in the section ‚Äúusage‚Äù, you can also view data about your usage behavior e.g., - depending on your subscription - the number of characters translated or improved in the past or the number of documents translated. If you have a consumption-based subscription, such as the DeepL API Pro, you can also view the monthly costs incurred. We justify this data processing via Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as it is necessary for the performance of the contract, in particular for billing purposes or for managing the number of documents still available for translation. Insofar as the processing goes beyond what is necessary for the performance of the contract, we base the processing on our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as we seek to meet our customers' wish to visualize information on usage behavior in a transparent manner. The graphical representation of the development of consumption over the contract period is considered to be also in the interest of our customers.
If you yourself are not a party to the DeepL Pro subscription, but access to our products is provided to you by your employer or an organization to which you belong, we may share data about your usage of the subscription (e.g. number of translated characters and documents across the DeepL products, last session and last usage date) with your employer or organization. Providing this data corresponds to our legitimate interests as well as the legitimate interests of our customers in receiving the information they need about the use of the subscription they have paid for, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
6.5 Processing of the Submitted Texts and Translations / Improvements
As contractually agreed, we process the content you submit to DeepL Pro and their translations or improvements only temporarily, insofar as this is necessary for the creation and transmission of the translation or improvement. This processing is therefore justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. The content you submit and the translations or improvements will - within the framework of the contractual agreements and as stated in section
4
and
5
- will be deleted after the performance of the contractually agreed service. This does not apply, if you use the "saved translations" or glossary feature. In this case, content provided by you, including translations, will be stored for your account and kept accessible for you at all times. When you use the ‚Äúsaved translations‚Äù feature in our mobile apps, your texts and translations are stored locally.
This data processing is necessary for the performance of our contract and is therefore justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.
7. Translation of Documents
7.1 Translation of Documents with DeepL Translator and DeepL Pro
You can translate documents in different file formats both with DeepL Pro (.docx, .pptx, .html, .pdf and .txt) as well as with DeepL Translator (.docx, .pptx and .pdf). When using document translation in DeepL Translator, section
3
of this privacy policy applies. If you translate documents of the file types mentioned above while you are logged in to your DeepL Pro account, the texts you submit will only be processed temporarily and will be deleted after the completion of the translation process, including the translations themselves (see also section
4
and
6.3
of this privacy policy). With both DeepL Pro and DeepL Translator, the translation of your documents will be provided exclusively by DeepL and processed on our infrastructure in the EEA.
7.2 Temporary Storage of Metadata when Translating Documents
Regardless of whether you use our paid or free service when translating documents, particularly the following data is stored for each translation process:
Status/progress of the translation process
Document file type
Selected language pair for translation
Estimates of time needed for the translation
References to the applied glossary (when using DeepL Pro)
Content of the applied glossary (when using the free translator)
Number of characters calculated
Errors that occurred during the translation process
This information is processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR based  on our legitimate interest in improving the functionality of our products, as this makes it easier  to identify any sources of error related to the translation process. The data is stored in a database that can only be accessed by selected employees and is automatically deleted after 14 days.
8. Automatic Collection of Data via Website Access
Regardless of whether you use our paid or free service, your device automatically transmits certain data for technical reasons when you access our website
www.deepl.com
. The following data that you may send us will be stored:
Date and time of access
Browser type and version
Operating system
URL of the website previously visited
Volume of data transmitted
Requested domain
Notification of successful data retrieval
Search term when using a web browser
Abbreviated/anonymized IP
Full IP address
Diagnostic information in the event of errors
Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website. The data is stored for purely technical reasons. Website access data is used for error analysis, ensuring  system security, logging access to DeepL Pro and for improving our translation or improvement services. Based on your IP address, we also use geolocation to determine the region from which you are visiting our website. We use this information to check whether we can offer you the DeepL Pro service in your region, which corresponds to our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. The storage of the full IP address for the users of the DeepL free version for a maximum period of 14 days is also justified by our legitimate interest in achieving the listed purposes, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. The storage of IP addresses of users of the paid DeepL Pro subscription for the duration of the contract is justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.
Our website also uses services of Cloudflare, Inc, 101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA ("Cloudflare"), which operates a so-called Content Delivery Network (CDN). To protect our website, the data transfer between your browser and our servers is routed through Cloudflare's infrastructure in order to analyze whether it is an abusive attack. As part of this analysis, your data is transmitted to Cloudflare in encrypted form, if necessary also to Cloudflare servers in the USA. However, since your requests and other customer data are encrypted between your end device and the DeepL servers, Cloudflare does not have any access to this data, but only to meta-data (such as your IP address). Only static resources (such as graphics) are loaded directly from Cloudflare-servers. In addition, Cloudflare determines a so-called bot score immediately before the login to DeepL, which is based on the analysis of the metadata of the client (browser) used. The use of Cloudflare is in our legitimate interest to secure the use of our website and to prevent and defend harmful attacks from outside, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.¬†We have concluded a data processing agreement with Cloudflare and Cloudflare may therefore only process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes. You can find more information about Cloudflare's handling of personal data

9.2 Analysis of User Behavior
In order to better understand how our products are used and to better tailor our products to the needs and desires of our customers, we analyze pseudonymized data about our customers' use of DeepL Pro products. The analysis allows us to understand general usage habits and derive different target and user groups. We can then address the identified user groups in a more specific way and, for example, point them to previously unused or unknown features of our products. In this way, we enable our customers to get to know and use all the features of their DeepL subscription and can thus improve the user experience of the DeepL products. This corresponds to our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) GDPR. The data is processed exclusively on DeepL‚Äôs servers in the EEA, the data is not transferred to the USA. No transfer of the data to third parties takes place. 

In case that users visit the website
https://developers.deepl.com
which is hosted by GitBook we use the services of Conva Ventures Inc. (‚ÄúConva Ventures‚Äù the corporation behind Fathom Analytics) to get basic insights about how our API documentation is being used. For the analysis, no cookie is set, and the analysis will only rely on the IP address and user agent of the user which will be hashed first. These pseudo-anonymized hashes will be anonymized after 24 hours. The data will be processed on servers in the USA. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Conva Ventures and Conva Ventures only processes the data in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes.

10. Speech-to-text function for web
For the web version of our DeepL Translator, we also offer a speech-to-text function, where the text to be translated can be dictated yourself. The recorded text is transcribed solely within DeepL's internal infrastructure.
When using DeepL Pro, the recordings and the transcriptions will not be permanently stored and will only be kept temporarily to the extent necessary for the production and transmission of the translation. After complete performance of the contractually agreed services the recordings, their transcriptions and the translations will be deleted. This does not apply when using the speech-to-text function as part of the free version of DeepL translator or the DeepL account, where the recordings, their transcriptions and the translations are stored and processed for a limited period of time to train and improve our neural networks and translation algorithms (please see also section 3 of this privacy policy). The user will be informed of this before using the speech-to-text function for the first time and asked to give their consent. The consent does not cover the recording of the voices of third parties, which means, you are not permitted to record the voices of third parties. You can withdraw the consent you have given at any time with effect for the future. You do this by deleting the corresponding cookie set by the consent. For further information and explanation of the withdrawal process, please click
here
.
11. DeepL Apps
In addition to the translation and improvement services on our website, we also offer apps for Windows and macOS operating systems (‚Äúdesktop apps‚Äù), as well as apps for iOS and Android (‚Äúmobile apps‚Äù), through which you can also translate or improve texts.
You can use the desktop apps and the mobile apps in both the free version and the paid DeepL Pro version. If you use the free version of DeepL in the¬†apps, Section
3
of this Privacy Policy applies; if you use the paid¬†DeepL¬†Pro¬†version, Sections
4
to
6
apply.¬†As the desktop apps use the same interfaces for creating translations or improvements as the web-based service, also sections
7
and
8
of this privacy policy apply to the use of these apps.
When translating or improving texts with our apps, for technical reasons - regardless of whether you use our paid or free service - your device will automatically transmit certain data. The following data which you can transmit to us, is stored:
Date and time of access
Version of the app
Operating system
Volume of data transmitted
Notification of successful data retrieval
Abbreviated/anonymized IP address
Full IP address
Diagnostic information in the event of errors
Type of mobile device (only for iOS and Android app)
Language in use
Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
Access status/HTTP status code
The processing of this data is based on our legitimate interest in ensuring and improving the stability and functionality of our services, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. This data is stored solely for technical reasons. Data relating to access is used for error analysis, ensuring system security, logging access to DeepL Pro and to improve our translation or improvement services. The full IP address of users using the free version of DeepL is stored for a maximum period of 14 days, which is also justified by our legitimate interest in achieving the listed purposes, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. The full IP address of DeepL Pro users is stored for the duration of the contract on the basis of Art.¬†6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.
If you use our mobile apps, it is also possible to have the entered text and the translation or improvement read aloud or to dictate the text to be translated or improved yourself. The speech service installed on your device is used for this purpose. Please note that this may result in the transfer of the entered or spoken content to the¬†provider¬†of the¬†speech¬†service used by your device, possibly also to the USA. DeepL has no influence on this processing of your voice and audio data, therefore the¬†privacy policy¬†and terms of use of the¬†speech¬†service used¬†by your device¬†e.g.¬†provided by¬†Apple,¬†Google or Samsung,¬†but¬†also¬†those¬†of other¬†speech¬†services that cannot be listed exhaustively, apply.
We use necessary cookies and web storage objects in our desktop apps as described in section
9
.
No cookies are used in our mobile apps. However, a unique user ID (no cross-device ID) is used, which allows us to track, for example, the source and target language settings, how many characters are translated or improved, whether the copy button is used, and if so, how it is used. The processing of this data is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR) to better understand the needs of our users and to be able to adapt the app according to customer requirements.
12. DeepL API Free
In addition to the paid DeepL API Pro plan, we also offer a limited free version of our API (DeepL API Free). For further information, please see our
DeepL Pro Terms and Conditions
and section
3
on using the free version of DeepL.
In order to use DeepL API Free, it is necessary to create a DeepL account¬†(please see section

). If you select the API Free option during the checkout process, further data, as specified in section
6.2
, will be collected. Although no costs are incurred when using DeepL API Free - subject to a (possible) upgrade - your payment data is collected in order to prevent improper use of API Free. Solely for this purpose, payment information is also passed on, in accordance with section
6.3
, to the payment service provider we have commissioned, Stripe Payments Europe Ltd.
We process your data in order to perform the free-of-charge usage contract concluded between you and us on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR and on the basis of our legitimate interest in preventing misuse of the API Free, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence lit. f) GDPR.
13. Connecting with our Customer Team, including via our ChatBot
You have various possibilities to connect with us, including via contact forms on our website, having calls with our customer team as well as by using our chatbot. You can also contact us directly by email.
We will process your personal data that you provide to us as part of these communications. This may include your name, email address and any other personal data you disclose to us.
13.1 Recording of dialer and Zoom calls
Our customer team is conducting dialer and Zoom calls with prospects and customers to provide them with general information about DeepL's services and to advise them according to their needs. In order to continue to provide excellent customer service and to continuously improve it, we may record and transcribe the dialer and zoom calls with prospects and customers
in certain countries
with their consent, using the Salesloft platform provided by Salesloft, Inc., 1180 West Peachtree St NW Suite 2400, Atlanta, GA 30309. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Salesloft and Salesloft is therefore only allowed to process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes.
Recordings of the calls, including transcriptions of these, are used for internal training and coaching as well as for documentation purposes. At the beginning of each dialer call, an automated message will inform the called party that the call is being recorded. If you do not wish to participate in a recorded call, you can end the call at any time. For Zoom calls, the Zoom invitation will inform you that the call is being recorded and that you can opt out when you join the call.
All recorded calls, including transcriptions, will be securely stored for a period of two years from the date of the call. After this period, the recordings will be automatically deleted from our systems. You also have the rights mentioned in section 20.
13.2 Sales and Support Requests

Furthermore, Salesforce CRM enables us to analyse our customer-related processes. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Salesforce and Salesforce is therefore only allowed to process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes. The customer data is stored on servers in the EU.
If you contact our support team with questions about your subscription, for example via our contact form, it is necessary to provide a valid email address so that we know who the inquiry comes from and can respond to it. We use the ticket system provided by Zendesk Inc. ("Zendesk"), 1019 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA We have entered into a data processing agreement with Zendesk and Zendesk may therefore only process the data in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes. Further information on the handling of personal data at Zendesk can be found
here
.
For both support and sales enquiries including any subsequent correspondence, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of your personal data, as the processing is necessary for the initiation of the contract or the conclusion and performance of our contract. Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR also provides justification for the processing of personal data that may be contained in documents sent to our Support team. We will store your data for the duration of our business relationship and subsequently for the duration of the legal retention periods where this is required. The processing of your personal data as part of our customer database and the analyses of our customer-related processes is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is in our legitimate interest.
If you have contacted our Support team via the contact form, it is possible that we will subsequently inquire by email about your satisfaction with our customer service. In this case, we will process your data on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR in order to determine customer satisfaction and to continuously improve our service.

15. User research and surveys
15.1 User surveys
Users are given the opportunity to participate in surveys via the web and app interface of our services. Participation in the surveys is voluntary and can be achieved, for example, via a pop-up found on the interface. The user may be redirected to a third party website (e.g. Qualtrics) to complete the survey.In order for us to properly analyse the survey results, we match your survey results with your product interaction that we collect when you use our DeepL products. This helps us to get better insights on how our users respond to our services, which help us to improve our DeepL product offering and services based on the collected survey information. Your personal data will not be collected or processed throughout the entire process. We won‚Äôt ask you to enter any personal data when taking part in the survey. Furthermore, to collect your product interaction data we don‚Äôt collect or process your IP-address. In order to obtain this data from you, we will assign you a user ID upon confirmation that you wish to participate in the survey. This user ID ‚Äì in the form of a cookie ‚Äì does not give away any personal data about the person behind the interaction data and is therefore anonymised.
Your survey results and product interaction data (if any) will be stored and processed collectively by DeepL for up to 2 years.
If personal data is nevertheless collected or processed in the aforementioned process - which we do not plan or assume from our side - we justify this via Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this represents the least intrusion into the rights of the user in contrast to an opt-in and corresponds to the principle of data minimisation.‚ÄØYou may withdraw your consent for the cookie at any time with effect for the future by deleting your browser cache.
15.2 Customer Surveys
We want to encourage customers to share their experiences with using our products. DeepL may therefore reach out to you occasionally, via email or other communication channels, to ask about your experience and/or satisfaction with our products. Participation in these surveys is voluntary, and most surveys can be answered anonymously. However, in some instances you may be asked to provide your name and/or email address, either optionally or as a requirement for completing the survey. If you provide us with your email, we may contact you afterwards (e.g., to invite you to participate in research studies or to share your experience in a call with our team).
The processing of your data corresponds to our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR to improve our products and to further develop them according to our customer‚Äôs wishes. If you provide your name and/or email address in the survey, we justify the processing of your data via your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR. You can revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future.
15.3 Typeform

16. DeepL‚Äôs Social Media Pages
DeepL operates several social media profiles (also called ‚Äúpages‚Äù) on various social networks e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Xing. There we regularly publish posts about our products, new product features as well as new job offers. If you interact with our pages or contact us via them and are a member of the respective social network, we may receive and process data that identify you. As operator of the pages, we also have the option of viewing anonymous statistics on the interaction of visitors with our pages (insight function). For this purpose, the operators of the social networks record your interactions with our pages using cookies and similar technologies. You can find more information on this kind of data processing by Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn
here
,
here
and
here
.
The legal basis for the operation of our social media profiles and the insights function is our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR in using the pages as an information channel for our company. With regard to the insights function, we have a legitimate interest in understanding the visits and interactions with our page in order to be able to respond to them and to further improve our presence. Insofar as your consent given to the social network justifies the data processing within the framework of the respective social platform, processing is carried out on the basis of this consent.
In addition, we use the LinkedIn image pixel to record and evaluate conversions from our LinkedIn advertising campaigns. Conversions mean whether a user is successfully led to our website via our LinkedIn advertising campaign. Furthermore, user interactions - i.e., individual steps taken by the user on our website - are to be recorded and tracked via conversions. The LinkedIn image pixel is embedded on certain pages of our website and provides feedback to LinkedIn if a conversion has taken place. In doing so, LinkedIn processes the user‚Äôs IP address as well as the presence of a cookie set by LinkedIn, which provides conclusions about the conversion. The processing of your personal data is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR). The consent is given via the cookie settings. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future by revoking the consent for the ‚ÄúMarketing‚Äù cookie category or deleting your browser cache.
Please note that we together with the operator of the respective social network are jointly responsible for the data processing operations triggered when you visit our page. However, the operators of the social networks may also process your data for their own purposes, which are not depicted in this privacy policy. It is also possible that data collected about you will be transferred to third countries, in particular the USA. We have no influence on this data processing and refer to the privacy policies of the respective social networks e.g., for Facebook
here
, for Instagram
here
, for Twitter
here
, for LinkedIn
here
and for Xing
here
.
In principle, you can assert your rights (see section
20
below) both against us and against the  operator of the respective social platform. However, we would like to point out that despite the joint controllership, you can most effectively assert your rights with the operators of the social networks. If you need help, you can contact us.
17. Webinars
We offer webinars for our users and existing or prospective customers. The webinars are interactive events on the products we offer, conducted by our staff. External speakers may also be invited to the webinars. We point this out accordingly before registration.
We use a service provided by Zoom Video Communications, Inc. ("Zoom"), 55 Almaden Blvd. Suite 600, San Jose, CA 95113, USA, on whose platform the webinars are held. Registration for our webinars takes place via a corresponding landing page of Zoom. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Zoom and Zoom may only process personal data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes. We would like to point out that if you access Zoom's website, Zoom is responsible for the personal data processed through your use of the website. If you have entered into a contractual relationship with Zoom, we have no influence on the personal data collected and processed in this context as part of our webinars. Further information on the handling of personal data at Zoom - in particular also in relation to webinars - can be found
here
.
In the event of registration for a webinar on a landing page provided by Zoom, we collect and process all personal data that you provide when registering for one of our webinars (first and last name, email address, company (optional), position (optional)). We process your data to fulfil the free participation contract concluded between you and us on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. We store your data on this basis for the duration of the existence of our contractual relationship, i.e. until the conclusion of the webinar, and subsequently for the duration of the statutory retention periods where this is required. If you have a DeepL account and it is possible for us to assign the webinar registration to this account, the processing of your personal data in the context of our customer database and the analyses of our customer-related processes until the end of the webinar is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is in our legitimate interest to record the demand for webinars and in this context to improve the services for our customers. After completion of the webinar, we note in our customer database under your account that you participated in the webinar. The name and e-mail address given during registration will not be noted and - if they do not match the details in the DeepL account created - will be deleted by us after the webinar has ended. Should personal data be processed at all in this note in the customer database beyond the webinar, we base this on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is in our legitimate interest to specifically identify whether customers understand our products in order to provide them with support more quickly in individual cases, or in order to provide certain customers with extended webinars and training.
When participating in a webinar and using Zoom, the following additional personal data is processed:
User information (This is data associated with the Zoom account and its authentication, e.g. first name, last name, display name, email address, password (unless Single Sign On (SSO) is used), profile picture, Zoom unique user ID);
Communication data (This is data that you independently enter, upload or share as part of the webinar and associated Zoom usage);
Meeting metadata and telemetry data (This technical data is, among other things, data relating to the use of the service, including when and how sessions were conducted (IP address, event logs, session information, etc.), as well as device and hardware information that Zoom needs to access in order for features such as camera, microphone, etc. to be operational in the context of participation).
Please note that it is also possible to participate in the webinar without having a Zoom account. In this case, the collection and processing of data is limited to the minimum necessary to be able to maintain the service for you. We have chosen settings so that the collection and processing of the communication content generally takes place on servers in the European Union. As Zoom is based in the USA, we cannot exclude the possibility that data processing (in particular meeting metadata) may also take place in the USA when using the service. A collection and processing of your data through the use of Zoom takes place on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR (participation contract). We store the data collected and processed by Zoom on our behalf for the duration of the Zoom webinar and subsequently for the duration of the statutory retention periods, if this is required. We have no influence on the duration of the data processed by Zoom under its own responsibility. Please contact Zoom directly for information in this regard.
Automated decision-making pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR does not take place.
Please note that we may record Zoom webinars and publish them afterwards on our website or social media channels. Participants will not be visible or identifiable in these recordings. As participants can only ask written questions, they will not appear visually in the recording. The answer to the participant's question will be part of the webinar recording. If, contrary to expectations, personal data of the participants is visible during the recording, it will be made unrecognisable before publication.  The recording and storage of the webinar is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as these processing operations are in our legitimate interest to improve the quality of our webinars. When the webinars are published, no further processing of personal data will take place, as we will make them unrecognisable beforehand - if they can be viewed at all.

We regularly evaluate our data processing procedures and modify them as necessary. In addition, we work with strict physical access controls to e.g. our IT infrastructure and data storage systems as well as to documents that contain personal data.
As outlined above in¬†section 9.2, we analyze pseudonymized data about our customers' use of DeepL Pro products to understand general usage habits and derive different target and user groups.¬†Pseudonymized data is used only until the purpose of data analysis is fulfilled and is destroyed thereafter.

Tracking Tools, Advertising and Your Choices
Learneo and our third-party providers collect information
            in the Services through tracking technologies, including but not limited to, cookies (small pieces of
            information or text files that a website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and is stored in a
            file on your computer's hard drive), web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded
            scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking
            methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed ("Tracking Technologies").
            Further details about the Tracking Technologies we use (including the purpose for using them),
            interest-based advertising, your choices and how to manage cookies and do-not-track signals are below, and can
            also be found in each Service's respective Cookie Policy, linked in each Service's
Part Two
section of this Privacy Policy
Advertising
We may serve ads on our Services or on external services
            and engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services
            and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing,
            across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device
            usage, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral
            advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a
            third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). Our advertisers'
            and ad networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies. Further details about interest-based advertising, your choices and how to manage related cookies can also be found in each Service's respective Cookie Policy, linked in each Service's
Part Two section of this Privacy Policy
.
Your Cookies and Tracking Technologies Choices
We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information
            about interactions with the Services, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.
            Tracking Technologies make Web-surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use
            the saved information to facilitate and improve your use of the Services.
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or
                removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the
                future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may
                need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to
                some Tracking Technologies, such as HTML5 cookies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these
                technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your
                ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and
                limitations.
Some App-related Tracking Technologies in
                connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by
                uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset
                manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other
                tracking, but these may not be completely effective.
Your browser settings may allow you to
                automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however,
                there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this
                context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do
                Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not
                Track," you can visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com
, but we
                are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information. You have the right
                to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to "do not
                track" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the "Contact Information for Specific Learneo Services" section above.
Many advertisers and service providers that
                perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that
                provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising
                Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn
                more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members,
                visit
https://youradchoices.com/
,
                and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some
                of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn
                more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
.
Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt
                out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.
                Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain
                interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content
                and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
                you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web
                browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may
                not, or may no longer, be effective.
We support IAB 2009
                Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (
https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf
) and expect that ad networks that we directly engage to serve you
                interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. We are not
                responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or
                programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
In addition, we may serve ads on third-party
                services that are targeted to reach people on those third-party services that are also identified on one or more of
                our databases ("Matched List Ads"). This is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by
                matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services. We are not
                responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. We
                are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out
                instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may
                change their options without notice to us or you. For more information, please see the selling and
                sharing sections of the applicable State-Specific Rights section.

                collects such data (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it, as described in this policy). This includes:
Processing your personal data to send you marketing communications, in cases where you have consented to such use, including sending you email communications to market and sell the Services, including to co-market, co-promote and cross sell Learneo Services.

                    your personal data for showing you advertisements, including interest-based or online behavioral advertising.
Collecting your personal data (including sensitive personal data) for identification verification purposes as described
                    in this privacy policy.
Learning how you use and interact with one or more of our Services for the purposes of improving the Services, including
                    testing, research, internal analytics and product development (when such processing is performed with cookies or
                    otherwise in a manner requiring consent).
To measure our progress towards corporate goals and key performance indicators, including gathering commercial data
                    related to our subscription Services (when such processing is performed with cookies or otherwise in a manner requiring
                    consent).
When we process personal data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of
                collection. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. We refer to the EEA and UK Resident Rights section
                below for further information.
Legal Obligation
: Learneo processes your personal data where necessary to fulfill its legal obligations under applicable
                law, regulation, court order or other legal processing (e.g. subpoenas or warrants). This includes for the purposes of:
Fraud protection, security and debugging.
Responding to data subject requests under applicable privacy laws.
Preventing, detecting and investigating security incidents and potentially illegal or prohibited activities.
Data retention and administration obligations.
Complying with requests of competent supervisory authorities and legal agencies.
Other Processing Grounds
: From time to time, Learneo may also need to process personal data if it is necessary to
                protect the vital interests of you or others, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
EEA and UK Resident Rights
Access
: You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process personal data concerning you, and request
                access to and/or a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
Rectification
: If you believe that any personal data we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that
                we correct or supplement such data. You may correct some of this information directly by logging on to your account.
Erasure
: You can request that we erase some or all of your personal data from our systems. Under the GDPR and the UK
                GDPR, this right is subject to certain exceptions. Please see the Data Retention section on the purposes for which we
                retain limited personal data.
Withdrawal of Consent
: If we are processing your personal data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of
                collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for future processing
                operations. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a
                case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your personal data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to

            certain purposes, such as for direct marketing purposes
Please note that these rights can often be exercised only under specific conditions set out in the GDPR and UK GDPR
            as applicable. Furthermore , we may not be able to fully comply with your request in circumstances where doing so is
            manifestly unfounded or excessive, or if it is not permitted by law. In those circumstances, we will still respond
            to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information,
            which may include personal data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.
If you wish to exercise any of your rights, please see the
Contact Information for Specific Learneo Services

Cross Border Transfers of Personal Data
Learneo has offices located in the United States, Israel, India, The
            Netherlands, Germany, and Canada and may continue to grow in other countries. We also have service providers both in the
            United States and throughout the world. As such, Learneo and our service providers may transfer your personal data
            to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home
            jurisdiction. These transfers are necessary in order for us to provide our Services. When we transfer information
            about individuals based in the EEA or UK outside of those countries, we will take appropriate measures to safeguard
            the transfer as required by applicable law, including:
Data Privacy Framework
: As described in our
Data Privacy Framework Notice
, we are
certified
and comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (‚ÄúDPF‚Äù) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively.
Adequacy Decisions
: European Commission decisions recognizing
                    that certain countries and territories outside of the EEA ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data.
                    Depending on your use of our Services, when we transfer your personal data from the EEA to Israel or the UK, we rely
                    on the European Commission's adequacy decision for Israel and the UK. Further, where we transfer your personal data
                    from the EEA to an US recipient participating in the DPF (including the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
                    Framework (DPF), where applicable), we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decision for the US.
Standard Contractual Clauses
: Transfers to countries that don't have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses (together with the UK Annex
                    for transfers from the UK), which we use for transfers to countries including but not limited to the US (where the
                    recipient does not participate in the DPF), and Singapore.
In certain circumstances, cross border transfers may take place on the basis of exemptions provided for under
            applicable data protection law.
You may always contact us to request a copy of the transfer measures that we have taken to safeguard the transfer of
            your personal data.
Complaints
You have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal data before a supervisory data
            protection authority.
If you are in Europe, an up-to-date list of data protection authorities is available at
https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en
.
If you are in the Netherlands, the data protection authority is the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, available at:
https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl
.
If you are in the UK, the data protection authority is the UK Information Commissioner's Office available at
https://ico.org.uk/
.
Terms for Brazilian Residents
If you reside in Brazil, this section
Additional Terms for European Economic Area and UK Residents
also applies to the processing of your personal data, including the data subject rights set out in that section, to the extent Brazilian Data Protection Law (as amended by Law No. 13,853/2019) (‚ÄúLGPD‚Äù) grants such individual rights.  To the extent there is a conflict between these terms and the rights granted by the LGPD, the provisions of the LGPD shall apply with respect to residents of Brazil and we shall honor such rights as required by the LGPD.
Additional Terms for Australian Residents
If you reside in Australia, the following additional terms apply in
            accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs") and the Privacy Act 1988 ("APA"). If there are any
            conflicts between this section and any other provision of this policy, the following terms shall prevail.
Government ID
To the extent we collect any government ID (such as driver's license, photo card, etc), we recognise that
            government ID is a special category of personal information that is subject to a higher standard of privacy
            protection compared to other types of personal data. Notwithstanding any other part of this policy, to the extent
            that we collect any such government ID from you, we will only collect, use and disclose such data strictly for the
            identity verification purpose set out in this privacy policy or for a purpose permitted under APP 9. We will not
            handle your government ID in any other manner or for any other purpose. Subject to any retention requirements under
            law or otherwise specified in this privacy policy, we will destroy or de-identify any record of your government ID
            stored in our systems when we no longer need to use it.
How To Access, Correct, Update, or Delete Your Personal Data
You can request to access, correct, update or delete your personal data by contacting us using the contact details 
            provided under the Contact us section in Part One.
You can request access to any personal data we hold about you at any time. However please be aware that from time to
            time we may need to reject your request to access personal data we hold about you, if we believe such rejection to
            be necessary and to the extent allowed by law.
If we do not provide you with access to any of your personal data, or do not correct any of your personal data, we
            will provide you with our reasons. If you are not satisfied with our reasons, you may make a complaint as set out
            below under the Complaints section.
Complaints
We take your privacy concerns seriously. If you have a complaint
            regarding our handling of your personal data or concerning our privacy practices, you may file a complaint with our
            Privacy Officer using the contact provided under the Contact us section in Part One. Our Compliance team will
            confirm receipt of your complaint and review it with our legal team. If we believe an investigation is necessary, we
            will open an investigation into your complaint. We may need to contact you to request further details of your
            complaint. If an investigation has been opened following a complaint made by you, we will contact you with the
            result of that complaint as soon as possible.
If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint, you may refer your complaint to the Office of the
            Australian Information Commissioner by contacting 1300 363 992 or by visiting the website www.oaic.gov.au. Further
            information about the APA and the APPs is also available from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
Transfers of Personal Data Outside Australia
We may share your personal data amongst Learneo, with third party
            service-providers and other third parties that require such information to assist us in providing Services to you.
            Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than Australia, including United States,
            Israel, India, The Netherlands, and Canada or other countries as might be the case in the future. We will only
            transfer your personal data overseas for the same purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Personal data that is
            stored overseas may not be subject to the APA or the APPs. However, we will not transfer or permit any of your
            personal data to be transferred outside of Australia unless we have taken reasonable steps to ensure the transfer is
            in compliance with applicable laws, and in any case to a recipient that has privacy protections in place which are
            at least substantially similar to which the APPs protect information.
Consequences If We Can't Collect Your Personal Data
If you do not provide us with the personal data we need, we may not be able to provide appropriate services,
            targeted content or relevant information to you, and in some cases you may not be able to use our Services.
Additional Terms for Mexican Residents
Purposes and Consent
For residents of Mexico, all of the purposes listed in this privacy policy are considered necessary for the existence, continuity and fulfilling of our contractual
            relationship with you and are considered primary purposes. Learneo therefore does not require your express consent for
            the processing of your data for these purposes. Any other purpose other than these primary purposes are considered secondary purposes, to which you will be provided notice and opportunity to object to processing of your personal data for those purposes at the time.  You may also notify us of your objection by email to
privacy@learneo.com
.
Please note that for processing described in the ‚ÄúSharing with Third Parties‚Äù section, we will obtain your consent for such transfers when required by law.  Otherwise, exceptions under Mexican law permit the processing described in this section, such as to perform our contract with you to provide our Services, to comply with applicable law or administration of justice.  Sharing to ‚ÄúService Providers‚Äù shall be considered a remission under Mexican law whereby each Service Provider is a data processor and bound by contractual terms restricting use of personal data processed on our behalf. Any ‚ÄúBusiness Transfers‚Äù described in that section are not a communication of data under Mexican law, they are considered  an assignment of the data controller obligations to a third party, which shall be communicated to you through the availability of a new privacy policy.
Your Rights under Mexican Privacy Law
You are entitled to: (i) access to your personal data kept by Learneo (ii); be informed of the treatment given to
            your personal data by Learneo; (iii) request rectification of your personal data in case the information is
            incorrect or incomplete; (iv) request cancellation of your personal data; (v) refuse to the treatment of your
            personal data; and (vi) revoke your consent for the processing of your personal data (together "ARCO Rights").
You may exercise your ARCO rights by contacting Learneo compliance at
privacy@learneo.com
with the subject "ARCO Rights", and providing the following information:
Your name and address
The specific Learneo Service you are using
Supporting documentation of your domicile in Mexico,

When you Apply to be a Tutor on Course Hero
If you apply to be a tutor, using the information above we
                        will verify your identity as part of your tutor application review. We may also verify your identity when
                        you withdraw funds from your tutor account or to protect your account when we detect fraudulent activity. To
                        verify your identity, we will collect your mobile phone number for SMS verification, an image of your photo ID
                        (such as your driver's license or other government ID; excluding passport), as well as a photo of

                        professional license card, we will verify the authenticity of that information.

                        this identity verification on our behalf. When we do, we will inform you about the service provider we use
                        and the process for verifying your identity with them. Any of the identification service providers we use
                        will only process your personal data at our instruction and for the purposes of verifying your identity
                        on Course Hero. In those cases, we will only collect and use the personal data you provide for
                        identification verification purposes with your consent that you provide at the time we collect this information.

Data Retention
Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable

                        long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. In the event that you choose to register for multiple Course Hero Services using the same email address, we may link your accounts (as stated on the applicable sign-up page), and if we do, we will retain all of your personal data in a single Course Hero Services profile associated with that email, and for the same duration.  In some cases, we retain personal
                        information for longer and for other legitimate purposes, including if doing so is necessary to comply with our
                        legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our

                        that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case
                        basis. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable
                        legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm
                        from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal

                        of personal information for a limited duration. For example, we keep account information like your account

Data Retention
Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable
                        law or regulation, we retain personal information about you for as long as you have an open account with us, as
                        long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for.  In some cases, we retain personal
                        information for longer and for other legitimate purposes, including if doing so is necessary to comply with our
                        legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our
                        rights, property and users, to resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by
                        applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form, where
                        that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case
                        basis.  To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable
                        legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm
                        from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal
                        information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We will maintain certain types
                        of personal information for a limited duration.  For example, we keep account information, like your name,
                        email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your
                        account.

                        holds about you directly within your user account, under "Account Settings".

Collected through your use of QuillBot
When you use our Services, we collect the following information:
Usage information (such as the date and time of visits, pages viewed, links to/from any page, and time spent in a session)
Device information (such as your internet protocol
                            (IP) address, Internet service provider, operating system, computer model, language settings and CPU
                            details, and web browser type)
Inference Information about your usage of
                            QuillBot, such as whether you are a frequent document uploader or user of a particular feature. We also make inferences about the text you input in order to provide you a better experience, for example by categorizing your text inputs to suggest the best QuillBot feature for your uses.
Location information (approximated, based on your
                            IP address).
We may also collect personal data you provide or otherwise make available to us when you use different features in our Services. For example:
We collect your text inputs or other information you provide in any of our Services, including any personal data contained within.
When you use the Plagiarism Checker, we store a
                            copy of your document, which includes any information contained within.
When you use our Paraphraser tool, we will collect
                            any information you paraphrase, including personal data you enter into Paraphraser.
When you upload documents to our Services, we will
                            store both a copy of the original document (or the text of the original document) as well as any outputs we provide (like the
                            paraphrased version) and any information contained within those outputs.
When you use QuillBot Flow, we will collect any information, including personal data, you enter into your project(s)
                            within the editor.
When you use our voice recognition features for audio to text conversion, the audio to text conversion
                            occurs in real time and audio is not stored by us; however, the text converted from audio input that is added by you to
                            your project(s) is stored by us in accordance with this policy.
Collected when you use QuillBot's Browser Extensions
When you use QuillBot's browser extensions, the
                        contents in the email you prepare and receive, chat messages you write (excluding history or chats received),
                        documents you create, search queries, and text you input on multiline fields on websites you visit ("Your
                        Content"), as transmitted by you in connection with your use of our extension, will be used in real time
                        on our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs, after which Your Content is deleted from our Services. We
                        only store Your Content after you provide your consent, which you can revoke at any time within the
                        extension icon found on the right top corner of your browser.
When you use QuillBot's Chrome extension, we will
                        store your Command Data, which includes the text and metadata (including any personal data as described in this
                        Privacy Policy) of any command that you provide to QuillBot to perform a specific function. For example, when
                        you provide the command "Write an email for a business proposal," we will store that text and the
                        metadata associated with it, including your personal data like your QuillBot account and browser information. We
                        use the Command Data we store to understand usage, optimize our Services, and provide the best experience on
                        QuillBot.
Command Data is distinct from Your Content, which includes
                        the contents of the email you prepare and receive, chat messages you write (excluding history or chats
                        received), documents you create, search queries, and text you enter in multiline fields on websites you visit.
                        We process Command Data in real time using our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs. After this
                        real-time processing, Your Content is deleted from our Services.
We also collect URLs and usage information (in addition to
                        the usage information described above), such as the number of times you disable/enable the extension on a
                        website. This information helps us understand how you use this service and how we can improve it.
We do not access your contacts, text in single-line fields
                        (which are more likely to contain personal data), or content in fields marked "sensitive," such as
                        credit card, password, email address, or email subject fields.
We only collect Your Content when the QuillBot icon is
                        displayed and enabled, indicating that Your Content will be grammar-checked or paraphrased. We only store Your
                        Content with your consent. You can disable the extension or revoke consent at any time by clicking the QuillBot
                        icon in the top-right corner of your browser and going to "Preferences."
We also collect URLs and usage information when you use
                        QuillBot on a website (in addition to the usage information described immediately above), such as the number of
                        times you disable/enable the extension on a website, which we retain to help us understand how you use this
                        Service and to help us improve it. We only collect Your Content when the QuillBot icon is displayed and enabled,
                        indicating that Your Content will be grammar checked or paraphrased. You can choose to disable the QuillBot
                        extension at any time on the top right corner of your browser. We do not access your contacts, text in
                        single-line input fields (which are more likely to contain personal data), or content in fields marked
                        "sensitive" such as credit card, password, email address or email subject fields.
Collected when you use the QuillBot Desktop App
When you install the QuillBot desktop app, QuillBot will
                        request permission to access your computer's accessibility features. This allows us to collect your
                        inputs from within certain applications on your computer to enable us to provide our Services to you. Your
                        inputs will be used in real time on our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs, after which they are
                        deleted. Access to your accessibility features also allow us to identify apps you use but which are yet to be
                        supported, so we can display a feedback widget. After you grant permissions to your computer's
                        accessibility settings, you can choose when to use the QuillBot desktop app to help improve your writing at any
                        time, by clicking on the QuillBot icon that appears when you open certain compatible apps on your computer.
Collected about you when you participate in QuillBot University
If you choose to sign up for a QuillBot University event (including live webinars), we will collect your first and last
                        name, email address, occupation, country of residence, and any other personal data you provide to us. We may use this
                        personal data in order to process your registration, provide you with the event, and to improve our future events and
                        our services.
Collected about you from third party sources
If you choose to sign up with QuillBot using certain
                        third-party log-in services (such as Facebook or Google) you will provide us or allow the log-in service to
                        provide us with your personal data, such as your email, name and/or username, if available, and any other
                        personal data specified by that third-party log-in service. For more information about the personal data shared

                        services. We may also collect personal data about you from a third party, such as your employer or
                        academic institution, to enable your account setup to use our Services. We will also receive limited payment
                        information from our payment service providers (as described above), which we need to manage your QuillBot
                        subscription.
We may collect the first and last name of any
                        author's work available in the Creative Commons for the purposes of establishing correct authorship
                        attribution and creating author profiles on QuillBot.
We use analytics services such as Google Analytics and
                        Amplitude to collect and process certain analytics data when you use our Services. These services may also
                        collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources. For more information about our
                        use of these services, please see our

                        experience and improve our Services.

Data Retention
Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, LanguageTool retains personal information about you for as long as you have an open account with us, as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for.  In some cases, we retain personal information for longer and for other legitimate purposes, including if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our rights, property and users, to resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form, where that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. For example, we retain account information like your account email address for as long as your account is in existence, because we need it to operate your account.
Deleting Your LanguageTool Account
If you would like to delete your LanguageTool account,  you can do this directly by going to "My Account" in "Settings.‚Äù  If you choose to delete your account: (1) all of your account information will be deleted from LanguageTool, 2) all your uploaded text, documents and order details will be deleted automatically; this is irrevocable, and you can never use or enter this account again; 3) we will no longer have access to your documents. This means we cannot deal with possible complaints, as we cannot address complaints from deleted accounts.
If the GDPR, US State privacy laws, or other privacy law grants you the right to have your personal data deleted entirely from LanguageTool and you want to exercise that right (or any other privacy right), please read Part One of this policy for how to submit your request.

VirusTotal inspects items with over 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blocklisting services, in addition to a myriad of tools to extract signals from the studied content. Any user can select a file from their computer using their browser and send it to VirusTotal. VirusTotal offers a number of file submission methods, including the primary public web interface, desktop uploaders, browser extensions and a programmatic API. The web interface has the highest scanning priority among the publicly available submission methods. Submissions may be scripted in any programming language using the HTTP-based public API.
As with files, URLs can be submitted via several different means including the VirusTotal webpage, browser extensions and the API.
Upon submitting a file or URL¬†basic results are shared with the submitter, and also between the examining partners, who use results to improve their own systems. As a result, by submitting files, URLs, domains, etc. to VirusTotal you are contributing to raise the global IT security level.
This core analysis is also the basis for several other features, including the VirusTotal Community: a network that allows users to comment on files and URLs and share notes with each other. VirusTotal can be useful in detecting malicious content and also in identifying false positives -- normal and harmless items detected as malicious by one or more scanners.
VirusTotal is free to end users for non-commercial use in accordance with our
Terms of Service
. Though we work with engines belonging to many different organizations, VirusTotal does not distribute or promote any of those third-party engines. We simply act as an aggregator of information. This allows us to offer an objective and unbiased service to our users.
VirusTotal's aggregated data is the output of many different antivirus engines, website scanners, file and URL analysis tools, and user contributions. The file and URL characterization tools we aggregate cover a wide range of purposes: heuristic engines, known-bad signatures, metadata extraction, identification of malicious signals, etc.
Scanning reports produced by VirusTotal are shared with the public VirusTotal community. Users can contribute comments and vote on whether particular content is harmful. In this way, users help to deepen the community‚Äôs collective understanding of potentially harmful content and identify false positives (i.e. harmless items detected as malicious by one or more scanners).
The contents of submitted files or pages may also be shared with premium VirusTotal customers. The file corpus created in VirusTotal provides cybersecurity professionals and security product developers valuable insights into the behaviors of emerging cyber threats and malware. Through our premium services commercial offering, VirusTotal provides qualified customers and anti-virus partners with tools to perform complex criteria-based searches to identify and access harmful files samples for further study. This helps organizations discover and analyze new threats and fashion new mitigations and defenses.
Malware signatures are updated frequently by VirusTotal as they are distributed by antivirus companies, this ensures that our service uses the latest signature sets.
Website scanning is done in some cases by querying vendor databases that have been shared with VirusTotal and stored on our premises, and in other cases by API queries to an antivirus company's solution. As such, as soon as a given contributor blocklists a URL it is immediately reflected in user-facing verdicts.
VirusTotal not only tells you whether a given antivirus solution detected a submitted file as malicious, but also displays each engine's detection label (e.g., I-Worm.Allaple.gen). The same is true for¬†URL scanners, most of which will discriminate between malware sites, phishing sites, suspicious sites, etc. Some engines will provide additional information, stating explicitly whether a given URL belongs to a particular botnet, which brand is targeted by a given phishing site, and so on.

Why is human review of my Gemini Apps conversations, feedback, and related data required?
How human review helps improve models
Google uses conversations (as well as feedback and related data) from Gemini Apps users to improve Google services so we can make them safer, more helpful, and work better for all users. These include the generative machine-learning models that power Gemini Apps and technologies that help reduce unintended activations of Gemini Apps. Human review is a necessary step of the model improvement process. Through their review, rating, and rewrites, human reviewers (which include third parties) help enable quality improvements of generative machine-learning models like the ones that power Gemini Apps.
How we protect your privacy in this process
We take a number of precautions to protect your privacy during this human review process:
Conversations (as well as feedback and related data like your language, device type, or location info) that reviewers see and annotate are not associated with any user accounts.
We pick a random sample for such human review, and only a portion of all Gemini Apps conversations are reviewed.
How the process works
Our trained reviewers look at conversations to assess if Gemini Apps‚Äô responses are low-quality, inaccurate, or harmful.
From there, trained evaluators suggest higher-quality responses.
These are then used to create a better dataset for generative machine-learning models to learn from so our models can produce improved responses in the future.
How long is reviewed data retained
Gemini Apps conversations that have been reviewed by human reviewers (as well as feedback and related data like your language, device type, or location info) are not deleted when you delete your Gemini Apps activity because they are kept separately and are not connected to your Google Account. Instead, they are retained for up to 3 years.
How you can control what‚Äôs shared with reviewers
If you turn off
Gemini Apps Activity
, future conversations won‚Äôt be sent for human review or used to improve our generative machine-learning models.
Don‚Äôt enter anything you wouldn‚Äôt want a human reviewer to see or Google to use.
For example, don‚Äôt enter info you consider confidential or data you don‚Äôt want to be used to improve Google products, services, and machine-learning technologies.
Learn more
about how to turn off, manage, and delete your Gemini Apps activity
at any time. Also, you can control Google‚Äôs storage of Gemini Apps activity in
My Activity
at any time.
Why does Google retain my conversations after I turn off Gemini Apps Activity and what does Google do with this data?
Google needs these conversations to respond to you and as context for feedback you choose to submit to help maintain and improve Gemini Apps, and to provide all users a safer and better quality experience.
Here are more details about conversations stored with your account even after you turn off Gemini Apps Activity:
Before you give feedback in Gemini Apps
If
Gemini Apps Activity
is off, Google retains your conversations with your account for up to 72 hours. This activity won‚Äôt appear in your Gemini Apps Activity and is used to:
Respond to your conversation contextually. For this purpose, Gemini Apps use only 24 hours of data.
Maintain the safety and security of Gemini Apps and improve Gemini Apps. For this purpose, Google needs the 72-hour retention period to help ensure that data from its backend processes is available in case of a potential failure in its systems.
If you turn off
Gemini Apps Activity
, Google does not use your new conversations stored with your account to improve its generative machine learning technologies, unless you submit feedback about a conversation.
After you give feedback in Gemini Apps
If you decide to send feedback to Google, Google‚Äôs systems collect the following information:
Your feedback.
Any included content, such as files and images you upload, as well as your personal content that Gemini¬†gets from connected apps.
Context that can help us better understand your feedback. This includes the last 24 hours of available conversation data, such as your prompts and Gemini Apps' responses.
Learn how Google uses my feedback
.
How does Google use my feedback?

Reviewed by specially trained teams.
Human review is necessary to help identify, address, and report potential problems raised in feedback. In some cases, this is required by law.
Used consistent with the
Google Privacy Policy

What does it mean that Gemini is a new and evolving technology?
Gemini Apps (previously Bard) are powered by large language models, as explained in
this overview of Bard
by James Manyika (Google‚Äôs SVP, Technology and Society). Like most large language models (LLMs), the models powering Gemini Apps were pre-trained on a variety of data from publicly available sources.
How LLMs work
With pre-training, LLMs find patterns in language and use them to predict the next probable word or words in a sequence. However, if an LLM picks only the most probable next word, responses would be less creative. That‚Äôs why LLMs are often given some flexibility. They can pick from a range of reasonable and slightly less probable words to generate more interesting responses.
Why responses aren‚Äôt always accurate
LLMs can at times perform well on factual prompts and seem like they‚Äôre looking up information, but they're not information databases or retrieval systems. When you query a database, you can expect the same exact response each time. But, when you give the same prompt to an LLM, you won‚Äôt necessarily get the same response every time or the actual information that the LLM was trained on. This is because LLMs are trained to predict the next most probable word, not get information.
This is also an important factor in why LLMs can generate plausible-sounding but inaccurate responses about people and other topics. This isn‚Äôt ideal when factuality matters, but it‚Äôs potentially useful for generating creative or unexpected responses.
Why Gemini Apps are new and evolving
Gemini Apps are part of our long-term, ongoing effort to develop LLMs responsibly. Throughout the course of this work, we discovered and discussed several limitations associated with LLMs, including five areas we continue to work on:
Accuracy:
Gemini Apps‚Äô responses about people and other topics might be inaccurate, especially when asked about complex or factual issues.
Bias:
Gemini Apps‚Äô responses might reflect biases or perspectives about people or other topics present in its training data.
Persona:
Gemini Apps‚Äô responses might suggest it as having personal opinions or feelings.
False positives and false negatives:
Gemini Apps might not respond to some appropriate prompts and provide inappropriate responses to others.
Vulnerability to adversarial prompting:
users will find ways to stress test Gemini Apps further. For example, they may prompt Gemini Apps to hallucinate and provide inaccurate information about people and other topics.
We focused on addressing these areas before launching Gemini Apps. And with the broader field, we continue to research solutions. We at Google are committed to working to improve over time.

What happens when I ask Gemini Apps to save info?
Information you‚Äôve asked Gemini to save (for example, ‚ÄúRemember that ‚Ä¶‚Äù) is used to provide more custom responses in Gemini Apps.
Info is saved until you delete it, and you can turn this setting off at any time.

.
Location & other permissions information
What location information do Gemini Apps collect, why, and how is it used?
Location data is always collected if you use Gemini Apps so that they can provide you with a response that is relevant to your query. For example, to respond to prompts like "What's the weather?", Gemini Apps need to know your location.
Where Gemini Apps get location data & how its used
The source of the location data Gemini Apps collect varies. By default, Gemini Apps use the general area from your IP address or the Home or Work addresses in your Google Account to give relevant responses to prompts like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the weather?‚Äù
With your permission, Gemini Apps also process precise location data from your device to provide more relevant responses. For example, Gemini Apps can use your precise location to more accurately respond to prompts like ‚Äúwhere is the closest coffee shop to me?‚Äù
Google also uses your location data, including your precise location data, for the purposes and based on the legal grounds described in the
Gemini Apps Privacy Notice
. Learn more about location data at
g.co/privacypolicy/location
.
How precise location data is shared
If available, Gemini Apps may share your precise location data with another Google service, like Google Maps, to fulfill your request. The Google service that gets your location data uses it consistent with the
Google Privacy Policy
.
How location data is stored
Precise location is not stored in your Gemini Apps Activity.
Location data that Gemini Apps process is coarsened to a general area before it‚Äôs stored with your Gemini Apps Activity. A general area is larger than 3 sq kilometers, and has at least 1000 users so that the general area of your¬†prompt does not identify you, helping to protect your privacy. This means that a general area is typically much larger than 3 sq kilometers outside of cities.

it‚Äôs deleted when you delete the related prompt.
If the file was uploaded from your Google Drive,
it‚Äôs no longer used to respond to you in the related chat, but it‚Äôs still in your Drive.
How does Google work with my uploaded images?
How images in prompts work
When you add an image to your prompt, or a screenshot using "Ask about this screen," Gemini Apps also use Google Lens technology to understand what's in the image and read the text. For example, Google Lens might interpret an image's pixels as a cat jumping. Gemini Apps add this information to your prompt to understand your request better. Google uses this information just like any other prompt, as explained in the
Gemini Apps Privacy Notice
.
How we limit use of your actual images
At this time, we don't use the actual images you upload or their pixels to improve our generative machine-learning technologies, unless they're included in feedback. If you
submit feedback on a Gemini App response
, the last image uploaded in the same conversation before that response is included as part of your feedback, unless you opt out. Google uses this data like all other feedback you provide.
Learn more about how Google uses your feedback
.
As we provide new features and improve our services, we will be transparent if we use your images differently.
How does Google use my uploaded files?
When you upload a file with your prompt, Gemini Apps can interpret it in connection with your prompt. This may include analyzing that file to provide information about it in a response.
Google doesn‚Äôt currently train its generative AI models using your uploaded files, unless you include them in your feedback.
As we provide new features and improve our services, we will be transparent if we use your uploaded files differently.
Generated images

https://automattic.com/privacy/:
Privacy¬†Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles:
We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.
Who We Are and What This Policy Covers
Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone ‚Äî from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises ‚Äî to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (‚ÄúGPL‚Äù). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.
This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:
Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, atavist.com, mailpoet.com, automatewoo.com, jetpackcrm.com, happy.tools, wpcourses.com, wpscan.com, newspack.pub, and wp.cloud);
Our mobile applications (including the WordPress mobile app for Android and iOS);
Our other Automattic products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites (for example, WordPress.com plans, the Payments feature, the Pay with PayPal block, WordPress.com, Jetpack, Woo Shipping, Woo Tax, Gravatar, the IntenseDebate comment management system, Akismet plans, Simplenote, Simperium, Cloudup, Longreads, MailPoet, AutomateWoo, Jetpack CRM, Happy Tools, WordPress.com Courses, WPScan and Newspack); and
Other users‚Äô websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us.
This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Automattic or one of our subsidiaries.
Throughout this Privacy Policy we‚Äôll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as ‚ÄúServices.‚Äù And if you‚Äôd like to learn more about which Automattic company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on
Controllers and Responsible Companies
.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services, like Tumblr, that have a separate privacy policy.
Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.
Creative Commons Sharealike License
We‚Äôve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a
Creative Commons Sharealike
license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on
GitHub
. You‚Äôre more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we‚Äôd appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.
Information We Collect
We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so ‚Äî for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let‚Äôs go over the information that we collect.
Information You Provide to Us
It‚Äôs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
Basic account information:
We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name ‚Äî and that‚Äôs it. You may provide us with more information ‚Äî like your address and other information you want to share ‚Äî but we don‚Äôt require that information to create a WordPress.com account.
Public profile information:
If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù description. Your public profile information is just that ‚Äî public ‚Äî so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
Payment and contact information:
There are various ways in which you may provide us payment information and associated contact information. For example, if¬†you buy something from us or earn revenue through your site, we‚Äôll collect information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us ‚Äî a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a
custom domain
, some Longreads swag ‚Äî or if you pay fees to a person or business through their WordPress.com site (for example via the Payments feature or the Pay with PayPal block), you‚Äôll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you‚Äôve made. If you use our Ecommerce Services (including Woo Shipping, Woo Tax, and WooPayments), you‚Äôll have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some Services, provide your site URL. You may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information. Additionally, if you use
WooPay
to make purchases on other sites, we will store the contact information and payment information you provide to that service. And if you participate in a revenue sharing opportunity for your site, like
WordAds
, you‚Äôll provide some additional information ‚Äî for example, a tax ID or other identifier so we can process payments to you.
Business Profile:
Some of our products collect additional information from you as part of creating a user/customer profile. For example, if you are a Jetpack CRM customer we may add you to our customer relationship database (powered by Jetpack CRM!) using information you provide us including your name, your employer, your job title or role, your contact information, and your communications with us. If you are a Happy Tools user, we use information you provide us like your timezone and location information, your company and team information, and your contact information, to set up your account and power the Service‚Äôs features.
Content information:
You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).
Credentials:
Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly.
Communications with us (hi there!):
You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).
Job applicant information:
If you apply for a job with us ‚Äî awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, professional or personal references, similar professional and employment-related data, and work authorization verification as part of the application process. We may also collect additional information about you during the process, like background and credit checks (in applicable jurisdictions and only for certain job roles).¬† You may also provide us with demographic information when required by law or to support our diverse workplace initiatives, such as your gender, racial or ethnic origin, veteran status, and disability status if you voluntarily submit such information as part of your application. We collect demographic information in accordance with applicable law, and do not request demographic information in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited. We will only use this sensitive information to accommodate a disability or illness, comply with legal obligations, protect the health and safety of our employees, and facilitate our internal programs relating to diversity, inclusion, and anti-discrimination.
Information We Collect Automatically
We also collect some information automatically:
Log information:
Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services ‚Äî for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.
Transactional information:
When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction. This includes when you purchase something we sell or when you use our Services (like
WooPay
) to buy something from a third party.
Usage information:
We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services ‚Äî in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted ‚Äú[title of post]‚Äù at [time/date]). Our
WooCommerce Usage Tracker
also tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, and PHP settings, along with information about your online store, like the aggregate number of orders and customers. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our
Admin Bar
and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.
Location information:
We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system‚Äôs permissions.
Stored information:
We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system‚Äôs permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device‚Äôs camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.
Interactions with other users‚Äô sites:
We collect some information about your interactions with other users‚Äô sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your ‚ÄúLikes‚Äù and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example,
recommend posts
we think may interest you. As another example, we collect information about the comments IntenseDebate users make while logged in and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and display information about your comments in your IntenseDebate public profile.
Information from cookies & other technologies:
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor‚Äôs computer, and that the visitor‚Äôs browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Information We Collect from Other Sources
We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:
Third Party Login:
If you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) we‚Äôll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address)
Social Sharing Services:
If you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our
Publicize feature
, we‚Äôll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.
Financial Account Info
:
If you use WooPayments, we‚Äôll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number. If you use WooPay, we‚Äôll receive your payment information from Stripe.
Google Account Information:
When you connect your Google account to your Newspack powered site, we may access certain Google user data such as your Google Ad Manager Configuration (the network code and your ad units) and your Google Analytics data to allow you to access and manage features more seamlessly. For example, you may be able to manage your Google ads and see your Google Analytics data directly within the dashboard of your Newspack powered site.
The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.
Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.
How and Why We Use Information
Purposes for Using Information
We use information about you for the purposes listed below:
To provide our Services.
For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.
To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.
For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
To place and manage ads in our advertising program.
For example, to place ads on our users‚Äô sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.
To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.
For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.
To protect our Services, our users, and the public.
For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
To fix problems with our Services.
For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
To customize the user experience.
For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.
To communicate with you.
For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Automattic; texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don‚Äôt want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we‚Äôll still send you important updates relating to your account.)
To recruit and hire new Automatticians.
For example, by evaluating job applicants (including verifying their identity, experience, and other information submitted) and communicating with them by phone, email, or social media platforms.¬† If the application progresses, we may also collect interview information and background check information.¬† This may also include verifying information required to initiate employment, for purposes such as confirming ability to legally work in a specific location, setting up payroll, and complying with statutory reporting requirements.
Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:
(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account ‚Äî for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or
(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or
(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or
(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information ‚Äî for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or
(5) You have given us your consent ‚Äî for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our
Cookie Policy
.
Sharing Information
How We Share Information
We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below, as well as in the section called
Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others
:
Subsidiaries and independent contractors:
We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.
Third-party vendors:
We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which powers WooPayments, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your own ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic); those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites (like the extensions on woocommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our
Cookie Policy
).
Legal and regulatory requirements:
We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our
Legal Guidelines
. Additionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers‚Äô (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our
Domain Registrations and Privacy support document
for more details.
To protect rights, property, and others:
We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we
may disclose information related to the emergency without delay
.
Business transfers:
In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
With your consent:
We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.
Aggregated or de-identified information:
We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
Site owners:
If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with another site using our Services, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site. For example, if you leave a comment on a site created on WordPress.com or running Jetpack, your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment. Or if you make a payment (like via the
Payments feature
) to a site, your public display name, user name, and email address may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site. Or if you follow/subscribe to another WordPress.com site we will share your email address with the site owner.
Published support requests:
If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.
Information Shared Publicly
Information that you choose to make public is ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî disclosed publicly.
That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your ‚ÄúLikes‚Äù and comments on other websites are all available to others ‚Äî and we hope they get a lot of views!
For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven‚Äôt uploaded one, is your
G
lobally
R
ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar ‚Äî get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and ‚ÄúLikes‚Äù that you make on other users‚Äô websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Your Gravatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, ‚ÄúLikes,‚Äù and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account is the same email address you use on the other website.
We also provide a ‚ÄúFirehose‚Äù stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly. Find out more about opting out of the Firehose for
WordPress.com
and
Jetpack
sites. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.
How Long We Keep Information
We generally discard information about you when it‚Äôs no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it ‚Äî described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information ‚Äî and we‚Äôre not legally required to keep it.
For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic‚Äôs websites, like the visitor‚Äôs IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automattic‚Äôs websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.
As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.
If you are a job applicant, we will keep your personal data during the application process, and for a certain period thereafter. To determine that period, we take into account a number of factors, like our legal and regulatory obligations (such as equal opportunity obligations) and whether we may need to retain personal data for internal business purposes like analyzing our applicant pool.
Security
While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like
Two Step Authentication
.
Choices
You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:
Limit the information that you provide:
If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services ‚Äî for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge ‚Äî may not be accessible. If you are a job applicant, and you choose not to provide certain data elements to us, we may not be able to proceed with the recruitment process.
Limit access to information on your mobile device:
Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for photographs.
Opt out of marketing communications:
You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
Set your browser to reject cookies:
At this time, Automattic does not respond to ‚Äúdo not track‚Äù signals across all of our Services. However, you can
usually choose
to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic‚Äôs websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic‚Äôs websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Opt out of our internal analytics program:
You can do this through your user settings. By opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you‚Äôre logged in to your WordPress.com account. For more information, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
Close your account:
While we‚Äôd be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. (
Here
are account closure instructions for WordPress.com accounts.) Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above ‚Äî for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
Your Rights
If you are located in certain parts of the world, including some US states and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the ‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:
Request access to your personal data;
Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
Request portability of your personal data.
You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.
US Privacy Laws
Laws in some US states require us to provide residents with additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. You‚Äôll find that information in this section (if you are a California resident, please note that this is the Notice at Collection we are required to provide you under California law).
In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information, depending on the Services used:
Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us or you may choose to voluntarily disclose your race or veteran status as part of your job application);
Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);
Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application); and
Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).
If you are a job applicant, we may have also collected:
Education information, such as the education you disclose in your job application.
You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the
Information We Collect section
above.
We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the
How and Why We Use Information section
. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the
Sharing Information section
. We retain this information for the length of time described in our
How Long We Keep Information section
.
In some US states you have additional rights subject to any exemptions provided by your state‚Äôs respective law, including the right to:
Request a copy of the specific pieces of information we collect about you and, if you‚Äôre in California, to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, and the categories of third parties we share it with;
Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
Request correction of personal information we collect or maintain;
Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information;
Receive a copy of your information in a readily portable format; and
Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights.
You can find detailed metrics about Automattic‚Äôs compliance with these rights in
our Privacy Report
.
Right to Opt Out
We never directly sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).
We may share your information as necessary with our third-party service providers to provide our services to you. To the extent that we share your information with certain advertising, marketing, or analytics vendors, this can be considered a ‚Äúsale‚Äù or ‚Äúshare‚Äù in certain U.S. States, which you may have the right to opt out of.
You can learn more about this sharing and how to opt out by clicking the ‚ÄúDo Not Sell My Personal Information‚Äù link in the footer of our websites, or from the settings page within our apps. Note that in some instances this link will only display to individuals visiting our sites from within the relevant states.
Our opt-out is managed through cookies, so if you delete cookies, your browser is set to delete cookies automatically after a certain length of time, or if you visit sites in a different browser, you‚Äôll need to make this selection again.
We also respect the GPC browser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire to opt out.
We do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive) personal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with our service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option to limit under California law. We don‚Äôt knowingly sell or share personal information of those under 16.
Your Information & Personalized Advertising
Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible. We show ads on some of our users‚Äô sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn‚Äôt become an obstacle to having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites. As part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users‚Äô sites and some of our own.
The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a ‚Äúsale‚Äù or ‚Äúshare‚Äù of information under some US state privacy laws. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information. Learn how you can opt out by going to
Advertising on WordPress.com Sites and Sites in the WordAds Program
.
Contacting Us About These Rights
You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren‚Äôt able to or you‚Äôd like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to ‚Äú
How to Reach Us
‚Äù to, well, find out how to reach us.
When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we‚Äôll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.
Appeals Process for Rights Requests Denials
In some circumstances we may deny your request to exercise one of these rights. For example, if we cannot verify that you are the account owner we may deny your request to access the personal information associated with your account. As another example, if we are legally required to maintain a copy of your personal information we may deny your request to delete your personal information.
In the event that we deny your request, we will communicate this fact to you in writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial email and stating that you would like to appeal. All appeals will be reviewed by an internal expert who was not involved in your original request. In the event that your appeal is also denied this information will be communicated to you in writing.¬† Please note that the appeal process does not apply to job applicants.
If your appeal is denied, in some US states you may refer the denied appeal to the state attorney general if you believe the denial is in conflict with your legal rights. The process for how to do this will be communicated to you in writing at the same time we send you our decision about your appeal.
Controllers and Responsible Companies
Automattic‚Äôs Services are worldwide. Different Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.
Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data. Generally, the ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you under the Terms of Service for the product or service you use. In addition, Automattic Inc., our US-based company, is the controller for some of the processing activities across all of our Services worldwide.

Transferring Information
Because Automattic‚Äôs Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third-party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the
How and Why We Use Information section
above.
When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with entities based in countries outside the EEA.
You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.
Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others
Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver ads that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Automattic and does not cover the collection of information by any third-party advertisers or analytics providers.
Third-Party Software and Services
If you‚Äôd like to use third-party plugins or embeds, WooPayments (powered by Stripe), Woo extensions that enable services provided by third parties, or other third-party software or services, please keep in mind that interacting with them may mean providing information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties. For example, some third-party services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors‚Äô, or customers‚Äô) data via a pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third-party service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the third party‚Äôs privacy policy and practices. We don‚Äôt own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about information collection, use, and sharing, which you should review before using the software or services.
Visitors to Our Users‚Äô Websites
We also process information about visitors to our users‚Äô websites, on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for their websites isn‚Äôt covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information. If you‚Äôd like, you can also read more about the data we collect on behalf of our users in our
Privacy Notice
.
Users control the content posted on their sites, so any disputes regarding content on a user‚Äôs site should be made directly to the site owner, through their ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù page, at an email address they provide, or by leaving a comment on the site.
Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Automattic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Automattic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our homepage or the
WordPress.com Blog,
or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.

GitHub Privacy Statement
Effective date: February 1, 2024
Welcome to the GitHub Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your ‚ÄúPersonal Data‚Äù, which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub B.V., processes as the ‚ÄúData Controller‚Äù when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, ‚ÄúServices‚Äù). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.
End User Notice: Organization-Provided GitHub Accounts
When a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:
Manage and administer your GitHub account, including adjusting privacy settings.
Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use the Services, as well as your content and files.
Should you access a GitHub Service through an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school, the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement's direct applicability to you changes. Even so, GitHub remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances, GitHub functions as a Data Processor, adhering to the Data Controller's instructions regarding your Personal Data's processing. A Data Protection Agreement governs the relationship between GitHub and the Data Controller. For further details regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement of the organization providing your account.
In cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at
GitHub Data Protection Agreement
. For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization's policies apply.
Third Party Access and Data Protection
When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.
Personal Data We Collect
Personal Data is collected from you directly, automatically from your device, and also from third parties. The Personal Data GitHub processes when you use the Services depends on variables like how you interact with our Services (such as through web interfaces, desktop or mobile applications), the features you use (such as pull requests, Codespaces, or GitHub Copilot) and your method of accessing the Services (your preferred IDE). Below, we detail the information we collect through each of these channels:
From You
Account Data: We collect certain information when you open an account such as your GitHub handle, name, email address, password, payment information and transaction information.
User Content and Files: When you use our Services, we collect Personal Data included as part of the information you provide such as code, inputs, text, documents, images, or feedback.
Demographic information: In some cases, you provide us with ethnicity, gender, or similar demographic details.
Feedback Data: This consists of information you submit through surveys, reviews, or interactive features.
Payment Information: For paid subscriptions, we collect details like name, billing address, and payment specifics.
Profile Information: We collect information to create a user profile, which may include a photo, additional email addresses, job title, or biography.
Sales and Marketing Data: This includes information provided for promotional communications, such as name, email address, and company name.

Automatically
Buttons, Tools, and Content from Other Companies: Our Services may contain links or buttons that lead to third-party services like Twitter or LinkedIn. Use of these features may result in data collection. Engaging with these buttons, tools, or content may automatically send certain browser information to these companies. Please review the privacy statements of these companies for more information.
Essential Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We use cookies and similar technologies to provide essential functionality like storing settings and recognizing you while using our Services.
Non-essential Cookies: Depending on your jurisdiction, we may use online analytics products that use cookies to help us analyze how de-identified users use our Services and to enhance your experience when you use the Services. We may also employ third-party Cookies to gather data for interest-based advertising. In some jurisdictions, we only use non-essential cookies after obtaining your consent. See
this
section for more details and control options.
Email Marketing Interactions: Our emails may have web beacons that offer information on your device type, email client, email reception, opens, and link clicks.
Geolocation Information: Depending on the Service's functionality, we collect regional geolocation data.
Service Usage Information: We collect data about your interactions with the Services, such as IP address, device information, session details, date and time of requests, device type and ID, operating system and application version, information related to your contributions to repositories, and performance of specific features or Services.
Website Usage Data: We automatically log data about your Website interactions, including the referring site, date and time of visit, pages viewed, and links clicked.
From Third Parties
Information from Other Users of the Services: Other users may share information about you when they submit issues and comments. We may also receive information about you if you are identified as a representative or administrator on your company's account.
Publicly Available Sources: We may acquire information about you from publicly available sources like public GitHub repositories.
Services you linked to your GitHub account: When you or your administrator integrate third-party apps or services with our Services, we receive information based on your settings with those services. This can include details like your name and email from services like Google for authentication. The information we receive depends on the third-party's settings and privacy policies. Always review these to understand what data is shared with our Services.
Vendors, Partners, and Affiliates: We may receive information about you from third parties, like vendors, resellers, partners, or affiliates for the purposes outlined in this statement.
Processing Purposes: How We Use Your Personal Data
The Personal Data we process depends on your interaction and access methods with our Services, including the interfaces (web, desktop, mobile apps), features used (pull requests, Codespaces, GitHub Copilot), and your preferred access tools (like your IDE). This section details all the potential ways GitHub may process your Personal Data:
Business Operations: We use Personal Data for activities like billing, accounting, and compensation. This includes creating aggregated statistical data for internal reporting, financial reporting, revenue planning, capacity planning, and forecast modeling (including product strategy).
Communication: We use Personal Data to inform you about new Services, features, offers, promotions, and other pertinent information. This also includes sending confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.
Inference: We generate new information from other data we collect to derive likely preferences or other characteristics. For instance, we infer your general geographic location based on your IP address.
Personalization: We use Personal Data to customize the Service to your preferences, to evaluate the effectiveness of enterprise business ads and promotional communications, and to ensure a seamless and consistent user experience.
Safety and Security: To promote safety, integrity, and security across our Services, we process Personal Data, using both automated and, at times, manual techniques for abuse detection, prevention, and violations of terms of service.
Service Provision: We use Personal Data to deliver and update our Services as configured and used by You, and to make ongoing personalized experiences and recommendations.
Troubleshooting: We use Personal Data to identify and resolve technical issues.
Ongoing Service Performance: Personal Data helps us keep the Services up to date and performant, and meet user productivity, reliability, efficacy, quality, privacy, accessibility and security needs.
Complying with and resolving legal obligations: including responding to Data Subject Requests for Personal Data processed by GitHub as Controller (for example website data), tax requirements, agreements and disputes.
Delivering Professional Services: We use Personal Data to deliver training, consulting or implementation (‚ÄúProfessional Services‚Äù). This includes providing technical support, professional planning, advice, guidance, data migration, deployment, and solution/software development services.
Improving Professional Services: Enhancing delivery, efficacy, quality, and security of Professional Services and the underlying product(s) based on issues identified while providing Professional Services, including fixing software defects, and otherwise keeping the Professional Services up to date and performant.
When carrying out these activities, GitHub practices data minimization and uses the minimum amount of Personal Information required.
Sharing of Personal Data

Abuse and Fraud Prevention Entities: We may disclose Personal Data based on a good faith belief it is needed to prevent fraud, abuse, or attacks on our Services, or to protect the safety of GitHub and our users.
Affiliates: Personal Data may be shared with GitHub affiliates, including Microsoft, to facilitate customer service, marketing and advertising, order fulfillment, billing, technical support, and legal and compliance obligations. Our affiliates may only use the Personal Data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.
GitHub Organization Accounts: If an organization adds you to their GitHub account, we might share Personal Data with that organization to fulfill the commercial relationship. In such a case, your use of the Services is protected by a data protection agreement and terms between your organization and GitHub
Competent Authorities: We may disclose Personal Data to authorized law enforcement, regulators, courts, or other public authorities in response to lawful requests or to protect our rights and safety. Please refer to our
Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data
for more information.
Corporate Transaction Entities: we might disclose Personal Data within the limits of the law and in accordance with this Privacy Statement for strategic business transactions such as sales or a merger.
Partners and Resellers: We cooperate with third-parties that offer sales, consulting, support, and technical services for our Services. We may share your data with these partners and resellers where allowed, and with your consent when required.
Subprocessors and Service Providers: We may use vendors to provide services on our behalf, including hosting, marketing, advertising, social, analytics, support ticketing, credit card processing, or security services. They are bound by contractual obligations to ensure the security, privacy, and confidentiality of your information. Please visit
https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-subprocessors
to see our list of Subprocessors.

Other Third-party Applications: Upon your instruction, we may share Personal Data with third-party applications available on our Marketplace. You are responsible for the data you instruct us to share with these applications.
Other Users and the Public: Depending on your account settings, we may share Personal Data with other users of the Services and the public. You control what information is made public. To adjust your settings, visit User Settings in your profile. Please be aware that any information you share in a collaborative context may become publicly accessible.
Private repositories: GitHub Access
If your GitHub account has private repositories, you control the access to that information. GitHub personnel does not access private repository information without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Statement and for:
security purposes
automated scanning or manual review for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service
to assist the repository owner with a support matter
to maintain the integrity of the Services, or
to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law.
GitHub will provide you with notice regarding private repository access unless doing so is prohibited by law or if GitHub acted in response to a security threat or other risk to security.
Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data (Applicable to EEA and UK End Users)
GitHub processes Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR, ensuring a lawful basis for each processing activity. The basis varies depending on the data type and the context, including how you access the services. Our processing activities typically fall under these lawful bases:
Contractual Necessity: Processing is required to fulfill our contractual duties to you, in accordance with the GitHub Terms of Service.
Legal Obligation: We process data when it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights, safety, and property of GitHub, our affiliates, users, or third parties.
Legitimate Interests: We process data for purposes that are in our legitimate interests, such as securing our Services, communicating with you, and improving our Services. This is done only when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights or your fundamental rights and freedoms.
Consent: We process data when you have explicitly consented to such processing. When we rely on consent as the legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent for data processing at any time. The procedures for withdrawal are detailed in this Statement and available on our website.
Your Privacy Rights

We aim to promptly respond to requests in compliance with legal requirements. Please note that we may retain certain data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.
International data transfers
GitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under
Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914
, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission‚Äôs decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the
European Commission website
.
Data Privacy Framework (DPF)
GitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub‚Äôs behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Dispute resolution process
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact GitHub at: dpo[at]github[dot]com.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution are provided at no cost to you.
An individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms. For additional information visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2
.
Government Enforcement
GitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. ¬ß 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.
Security and Retention
GitHub uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your Personal Data. We‚Äôll retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active and as needed to fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. The retention duration depends on the purpose of data collection and any legal obligations.

Our use of cookies and tracking technologies
Cookies and tracking technologies
GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about
cookies on GitHub
that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.
For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users‚Äô interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.
Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.
The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a ‚Äúpersistent‚Äù or ‚Äúsession‚Äù cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see
GitHub General Privacy Statement
.
What are cookies and similar technologies?
We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.
Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.
Web beacons are electronic images (also called ‚Äúsingle-pixel‚Äù or ‚Äúclear GIFs‚Äù) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.
Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.
We may also use so-called ‚Äúflash cookies‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúLocal Shared Objects‚Äù or ‚ÄúLSOs‚Äù) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.
How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?
The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.
We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.
The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:
Purpose
Description
Required Cookies
GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.
Analytics
We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.
Social Media
GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub‚Äôs websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.
Advertising
In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.
What are your cookie choices and controls?
You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:
Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages
Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page‚Äôs footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.
Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.
Generally for all websites
You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:
If your browser sends a
Do Not Track
(DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as
Privacy Badger
, non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.

US State Specific Information
This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù as an equivalent to the term ‚ÄúPersonal Data.‚Äù
Privacy Rights
These rights are common to the US State privacy laws:
Right to Knowledge and Correction: You have the right to request details on the specific personal information we‚Äôve collected about you and the right to correct inaccurate information. You can exercise this right by contacting us. You can also access and edit basic account information in your settings.
Right to Know Data Recipients: We share your information with service providers for legitimate business operations, such as data storage and hosting. For more details, please see ‚ÄúSharing Your Information‚Äù below.
Right to request Deletion: You reserve the right to request the deletion of your data, barring a few exceptions. Such exceptions include circumstances where we are required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of our Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.
Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.
Non-Discrimination: We will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact us with any questions.

Sub-policy 13
https://haveibeenpwned.com/Privacy:
About us and what we do
HaveIBeenPwned.com (
HIBP
) is owned and operated by Superlative Enterprises Pty Ltd ABN 62 085 442 020 (
"Superlative"
,
"we"
or
"us"
), a small business based in the state of Queensland, Australia.  We have created this policy to explain what limited personal information we collect when you use the HIBP site and how we handle and protect your personal information.
HIBP's purpose is to help individuals and organisations combat violations of privacy by enabling them to identify when information has been involved in a data leak. HIBP helps create visibility as to how personal data spreads. Individuals and organisations may no longer be able to control information once it is breached, however, they can at least understand what has been leaked, where it has been leaked from and what precautionary measures should be taken as a result.
HIBP delivers a range of free and paid services to individuals and organisations anywhere in the world to help them determine if they have been impacted by a data breach, including:
a point-in-time search to check whether an email address entered by an individual into the HIBP search engine has been involved in a data breach;
a point-in-time search to find all breached email addresses on a domain verified as controlled by the enquirer;
a point-in-time search for real world passwords previously exposed in data breaches;
a subscriber service for verified individuals to be notified of data breaches connected to their email address; and
a subscriber service for enterprises and individuals to assist in monitoring breaches.
What kinds of personal information do we collect and hold?
When we use the term personal information, we mean any information or an opinion about an individual who is identified or reasonably identifiable to us.  Personal information is sometimes also referred to as personal data.  We only collect the limited personal information we need for the purposes of providing our services.
We collect and hold email addresses for the purposes of providing our subscription services to verified email addresses.
We collect and hold only the bare minimum logging information required to keep the service operational and combat malicious activity. This includes transient web server logs, Google Analytics to assess usage patterns and Application Insights for performance metrics. These logs may include information submitted in a form by the user, browser headers such as the user agent string and, in some cases, the user's IP address.
We do not collect or store your personal information when you conduct a search in the HIBP database. Searching for an email address or phone number only ever retrieves the data from storage then returns it in the response. The data from the search is not explicitly stored anywhere.
We also store some lists of data classes that were impacted in a particular data leak that is loaded into HIBP.  For example, we will state that email addresses and passwords appeared in a leak but will not provide any information about which email addresses had corresponding compromised passwords.
The information we collect is not always personal information, as it may not relate to an identified individual or we otherwise may not be able to identify you from it.
The Pwned Passwords feature
searches compromised passwords from data leaks for the presence of a user-provided password. The password is hashed client-side with the SHA-1 algorithm then only the first 5 characters of the hash are sent to HIBP following
the Cloudflare k-anonymity implementation
. HIBP never receives the original password nor enough information to discover the original password.  No identifying information about who the password belongs to is stored.
Sensitive information is a subset of personal information that includes health information and other forms of sensitive personal information, and generally requires a higher level of privacy protection than other types of personal information.  We do not collect sensitive information.
How do we collect, hold and use personal information?
Collection
We collect personal information:
from individuals directly, who subscribe to our services; and
from third parties, such as breached organisations, where Superlative can verify the legitimacy of a breach.
Storage
When a data breach is loaded into HIBP by Superlative, the email addresses are stored in the online system. In limited cases, phone numbers are loaded in separately where they exist in an isolated data store not attached to any other personal information.  Phone numbers are not linked to any corresponding email addresses. No other data of any kind (like names) is stored on data load.
Superlative securely stores the personal information we hold in a Western United States of America Microsoft Azure data centre.
Uses
We use the personal information we hold for the purpose of providing our services.
Our subscriber database is checked when new breach data is loaded to establish if the subscriber appears in a new breach, and to send an email notification to the subscriber if required.  These email notifications are only ever sent to subscribers who ‚Äòdouble' opt-in to receive notifications. This involves entering an email address on the notification page or domain search page, and then successfully proving control of the email address through email verification. The verification email contains a unique link which must be followed to confirm the subscriber opts-in. Anti-automation measures are in place to limit attempts to subscribe email addresses in bulk.
Sensitive data breaches
Data breaches that we flag as sensitive are not returned in public searches, they can only be viewed by using the subscription service and verifying ownership of the relevant email address first. Sensitive breaches are also searchable by domain owners who prove they control the domain using the domain search feature.  For more information about how we flag sensitive breaches, see
Here's how I'm going to handle the Ashley Madison data
.
Who do we disclose your information to, and why?
We only disclose the limited personal information required for the purposes of providing our services.
Domain searches
Domain searches allow the exposure of all email addresses on that domain to be returned in a single search. Only someone who controls the domain or the website it is bound to can perform a search via one of the verification processes:
Via email address on the WHOIS record
Via a common security or administrative email address (security@, hostmaster@, postmaster@, webmaster@)
Via a meta tag with a unique code placed on the website
Via a file with a unique code uploaded to the website
Via a txt entry on the DNS record with a unique code
A domain search logs the domain name and requestor's IP address as part of anti-abuse measures.
If you ask Superlative to notify you of future appearance of email addresses on that domain and you provide your email address so it can be notified, that email address is also stored. Anti-automation measures are in place to limit attempts to automate searches.
When someone subscribes to notifications or searches a domain, that information is not passed to any third parties under any circumstances other than to send email using the SendGrid service.
Will we disclose your information overseas?
We store all personal information securely in a Western United States of America Microsoft Azure data centre.  This data is not shared or disclosed to any third parties overseas.
How do we protect your data?
Security on HIBP is handled by a "defence in depth" approach, that is the service employs many different layers of security including (but not limited to):
all data transmitted over the internet is done over HTTPS;
Cloudflare is used extensively to block potentially malicious requests;
rate limits on APIs are implemented at both the code level and via Cloudflare;
regular security scans are performed to identify code or configuration vulnerabilities;
firewalls are employed to limit access to services running on Microsoft Azure; and
disclosure of any security vulnerabilities are encouraged via
the security.txt file
.
Third party components are kept well-maintained (see
OWASP's Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
).
Access to and correction of your personal information
Access
You may access the limited information we hold about you in the HIBP platform in real time. Where there are sensitive breaches, we verify that the requester is the person to whom the information relates prior to allowing access.
Correction
To ensure the quality and accuracy of the information we publish, we limit the information we collect and take steps to verify identified and reported breaches. Once we receive personal information known to be involved in a verified data breach, the information cannot be changed retroactively.
Sensitive data breaches
Data breaches flagged as sensitive are not returned in public searches.  If you wish to prevent any other breached information from being publicly associated with your email address, please utilise our opt-out feature detailed below.
In certain circumstances, subscribers may request correction to their personal information, such as their contact email address, by contacting us. Our contact details are set out below.
Unsubscribing and opt-out
By email
Every breach notification email that we send contains an unsubscribe link in the footer. If you would like to unsubscribe but cannot find a recent email from us, use
the notification service
to send another email to yourself and that will contain the unsubscribe link.
Using our opt-out feature
Superlative provides
an opt-out feature
for HIBP that, if used, removes an email address from public visibility. The opt-out feature provides you with 3 different ways to control how your personal data is stored and accessed:
Just removal from public searches: The public email address search no longer returns your address. Your address is still stored, you can still see breaches against it by verifying control with the notification service and anyone control the domain your address is on can continue to see breaches against it using the domain search feature.
Remove all current and future breaches: No existing breaches impacting your address nor any occurring in the future will be stored against your address. No searches of any kind will return a breach associated with your address. Your address is retained alongside instructions to never load future breaches against it.
Remove the email address entirely: The address and associated breaches are permanently removed. If a future breach is loaded that includes your address, it will become publicly searchable again.
Questions, concerns or complaints
If you have any questions, concerns or complaint about the way in which we have handled your personal information, you should contact us in the first instance. Our contact details are set out below.
We will endeavour to reply to you within a reasonable time following receipt of the complaint and, where appropriate, will advise you of the general reasons for the outcome of the complaint.
If you remain unsatisfied with the way in which we have handled a privacy issue, you may approach an independent advisor. There is more information and guidance on the website of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (
www.oaic.gov.au
) about protecting your privacy.

,
the people who matter most to you online

When you‚Äôre not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you‚Äôre using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you‚Äôre signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services ‚Äî for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google‚Äôs first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you‚Äôve already installed and videos you‚Äôve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for ‚Äúmountain bikes,‚Äù you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don‚Äôt show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don‚Äôt show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don‚Äôt share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the ‚Äútap to call‚Äù button, we‚Äôll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we‚Äôll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google‚Äôs services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We‚Äôll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn‚Äôt covered in this Privacy Policy.

An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,

Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These ‚Äúserver logs‚Äù typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for ‚Äúcars‚Äù looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user‚Äôs ISP. Depending on the user‚Äôs service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they‚Äôve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device‚Äôs settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device‚Äôs unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you‚Äôre signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account‚Äôs Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at

We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you‚Äôre not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that‚Äôs publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google‚Äôs AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business‚Äôs information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‚Äòlbcs‚Äô that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The ‚Äúlast account activity‚Äù feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.‚Äù We don‚Äôt use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you‚Äôve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you‚Äôve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you‚Äôre signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you‚Äôre a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like ‚ÄúHey Google,‚Äù Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Information we share
We will only share your personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following circumstances:
As permitted under the
Google Privacy Policy
As permitted by law
As necessary to process your transaction and maintain your account, including to provide security improvements, protect your account against fraud, and for other everyday business purposes
To complete your requested registration for a service provided by a third party
To inform a third-party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google payments profile that can be used to make payments through that merchant's site or app. You can choose to turn off this setting
To share fraud risk scores and other fraud assessments with third parties that use Google‚Äôs risk score and fraud prevention services, in order to protect your transactions with third parties from fraud and abuse
To help ensure your payment method is secure and valid, and to provide you with relevant information about your payment method's features and benefits, we may share your personal information with your payment method issuer, payment network, processors, and their affiliates
Examples of when information may be shared:
When you make a purchase or transaction using Google Payments, we make certain personal information about you available to the company or individual that you purchase from or transact with. This includes sharing your personal information with the developer from whom you purchase when you use Google Payments to make a purchase on Google Play
When you make a purchase through a website or app with Google Pay, we might share your ZIP code or postcode and information about your payment method so that the merchant can calculate tax, shipping, and other details related to the cost of your order (such as delivery costs and other price information), and identify whether the merchant can accept that form of payment from you as well as benefits or restrictions for particular forms of payment for your purchase
When you add a third-party payment method to your Google payments profile, we may exchange certain personal information with the third-party payment provider so we can both provide the service to you. The information may include your name, profile image, email, Internet protocol (IP) address, billing address, phone number, device information, location, and Google Account activity information
When you visit a participating merchant site or app, the merchant can check whether you have a Google payments profile with an eligible payment method that can be used to make a purchase through the merchant's site or app, in order to reduce the likelihood that you will see unusable features on sites or apps
When you transact with a third party (like merchants and payment service providers), we may send fraud risk scores and other fraud assessments related to your payment transaction to these third parties, solely for their own fraud or abuse prevention purposes
The information we collect, including information obtained from third parties, may be shared with our affiliates, meaning other companies owned and controlled by Google LLC. Our affiliates, which can be financial and non-financial entities, will use such information for purposes as disclosed in this Privacy Notice and the Google Privacy Policy, including for their everyday business purposes.
We provide you with the right to opt out of certain sharing between GPC and its affiliates, if applicable. Specifically, you may choose to opt out of:
Sharing between GPC and its affiliates of information about your creditworthiness for their everyday business purposes; and/or
Our affiliates marketing their products or services to you based on your personal information that we collect and share with them. This information includes your account history with us
You may also choose to opt out of Google LLC or its affiliates informing a third-party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google payments profile that can be used for payment through that merchant's site or app.
If you choose to opt out, your choice will be effective until you tell us to change your choice.
If you do not want us to share personal information about your creditworthiness between GPC and its affiliates, or if you do not want our affiliates to use your personal information collected by us and shared with them to market to you, or if you do not want Google LLC or its affiliates to inform a third-party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google payments profile, please indicate your preference by logging in to your account, and going to your
Google Payments privacy settings
to update your privacy preferences.
We will not share your personal information with anyone outside of GPC or with our affiliates except as described in this Privacy Notice or the Google Privacy Policy. Google Payments is a product offered to Google Account holders. Data that you provide to Google LLC for the purpose of signing up for a Google Account is not affected by the opt-out provisions in this Privacy Notice.
Keeping your information secure
For more information about our security practices, please see the main
Google Privacy Policy
.
The security of your Google payments profile depends on you keeping your account password(s), PINs, and other access information for the Service confidential:
If you share your Google Account information with a third party, they will have access to your Google payments profile and your personal information
It is your responsibility to control access to your mobile device and the Google Payments application on your device, including keeping your password(s) and/or PIN confidential and not sharing it with anyone
It is also your responsibility to alert Google or the relevant partner if you believe that the security of the information in the Google Payments application has been compromised
Any information that you provide directly to a third-party merchant, website or application is not covered by this Privacy Notice. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of merchants or other third parties with whom you choose to share your personal information directly.

Transactions Involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings.
