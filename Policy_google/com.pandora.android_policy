Table
in Section 15.
Personal Data We Collect Directly From or About You.
You may provide us with the information described in the
Table
in Section 15 directly when you engage with the Services, such as signing up for an account online, through an application, or interact with a Listener Care agent. We also may collect personal data directly from you when you choose to provide to it, such as when you respond to a survey or when you conduct a transaction, such as purchasing merchandise from a Sirius XM store.
Inferences.
We use proprietary and licensed modeling tools and algorithms to infer additional information about you from your listening history, demographic data or other data that we collect directly from or indirectly about you to personalize your service, marketing and advertising.  We do not use inferences to make determinations that would have a legally significant impact on you.
Profiles.
SiriusXM-brand subscriptions may allow the creation of in-vehicle profiles for individual listeners.  If you are the primary account holder of a SiriusXM-brand subscription, you are responsible for access by anyone whose profile you allow to connect to your Sirius XM Service, and the terms of your subscription plan, the Sirius XM Customer Agreement and this Policy will apply to their use of your subscription.  If  you set up a profile for listening use on a Sirius XM-brand Service, you provide us with personal data and agree that such personal data and any listening and service usage information associated to your profile may be collected and processed to support the profile features. We do not use profile personal data for advertising or share profile personal data with third parties other than service providers. If it is technically possible and with your express consent, we may add your profile data to an account created explicitly for you when you subscribe to a SiriusXM-brand Service. The data on your subscription account will become subject to the full range of terms of this Policy.
Live Real Time Chat.
The Services may offer you a Customer Support Chat, which will record, use, and retain your information provided, as well as the communications within the chat, for purposes of assisting you during the conversation, provide related support for your account, subscription, or services, to improve our products and services, and for marketing purposes.

If you do not consent to such recording, use and retention, please do not use the chat assistance feature.
Photos and Audio.
We may allow you to post photos or audio files to the Services or we may collect photos or audio from another interaction you have with us, such as your call interaction with a Listener Care agent, your call-in to a show or host, or your participation at a Sirius XM or Pandora live event. We do not process your photos or audio to create a record of facial geometry or use as them as a means for facial or voice recognition, facial surveillance, or in any other way as a biometric identifier. We collect your voice command when you make a verbal request to the Services; we process your voice in order to execute your request and for analysis of the success rate of the request for product improvement. Your voice command is not used to identify you individually and is not retained in association with you or your subscription.

Your California Consumer Privacy Act Rights
Last Updated: July 1, 2024
This California Consumer Privacy Act Disclosures (“Notice”) supplements the information contained in the Pandora
Privacy Policy
and applies only to California residents regarding their Personal Information, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), CCPA as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CRPA”) and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder. Terms used herein (including defined capitalized terms) shall have the meanings set forth in the CCPA, CPRA, and the associated regulations, and in our
Privacy Policy
,
Terms of Use
, and
Artist Marketing Platform Terms of Use
.
Your Rights
Under the CCPA, California Consumers have the following rights, all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA:
Right to Know or Access
– the right to request that we disclose to you what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, share and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you;
Right to Delete
– the right to request that we delete certain Personal Information we collect about you, subject to exceptions specified under the CCPA;
Right to Correct
– the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you;
Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing
– you may opt-out from the sale of your Personal Information, or from the sharing of your Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising and
Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
– you may tell us to limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information to purposes set forth in the statute, including for use which is necessary and anticipated to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services.
More information on each of these rights is below. In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative. You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate, and respond to it.  We can’t respond to your request if we can’t verify your identity. Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity.  Please note to ensure the integrity of our systems and the proper fulfillment of your request, we cannot simultaneously process requests for access and deletion. Please wait until you are notified that a pending request for access or deletion has been completed before submitting a subsequent request for the second process.
Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
As disclosed in the chart below, some of the personal information we collect may be considered Sensitive Personal Information under California law. This includes race or ethnicity, religion, and precise geolocation derived from a device and intended to locate a consumer. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Limit Use and Sharing of such Sensitive Personal Information, please submit your request
here
or send an email request to privacy@pandora.com.
Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share For Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising
We sometimes share personal information to third parties as disclosed in the chart below, which in some instances may qualify as a sale under CCPA. If you use us or tell us directly to share your Personal Information with a third party, that disclosure is not a sale.
We share Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, i.e. targeted advertising.
If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Opt-out of Sale or Sharing for Cross-Contextual Behavioral Advertising, please submit your request
here
.
Cookie-Based Opt-Outs for Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share for Cross-Contextual Behavioral Advertising
Pandora engages third parties in online advertising practices, which may be considered a sale or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising, as defined in the CCPA and CPRA. You may opt out of cookies set by third parties by launching the Cookie Settings from the footer of our web pages. In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance also offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA and CPRA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies.  For more information, visit
https://www.privacyrights.info/
.
Right to Know
As a California Consumer, you have the right to know the categories of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which personal information is collected, our business and commercial purposes for collecting or selling personal information, and the categories of personal information we have disclosed for a business purpose, the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information, the categories of personal information we have sold and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold, in the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. You also have the right to request access to the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12-month period, or upon specific request, since January 1, 2022, which we will deliver to you electronically, in a portable format where feasible. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Know, please submit your request
here

California Consumers have the right to request deletion of the personal information about you that we have collected from you, subject to the exceptions set forth under the CCPA. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Delete, please submit your request at
here
.
Please note that as part of the verification process, once you submit a request to delete, we may follow up and require you to confirm that you want your information deleted.
If you are the master account holder of a Family Plan, deletion of your data may affect playlists and other content shared with the other accounts linked to your plan.
Please note that if you have an active Pandora account when you request deletion, we will not close your account. We will retain such information as is necessary to allow you continued access to the Pandora Service, maintain your contact preferences, and to service and manage your account. If you wish to close your account, please see this
Help Center article
.
Please note that even in light of a request for deletion, we are unable to delete information needed to:
Continue to provide service(s) if you have an active subscription to the Service, provide goods or services you’ve requested, complete a transaction or perform a contract;
Help ensure security and integrity;
Identify, repair, and debug errors that impair the Service, our systems, or other functionality;

Enable or enforce any other exceptions provided by CCPA or CPRA.
Right to Correct Inaccurate Information
California Consumers have the right to request that we correct inaccurate information we hold about you. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Correct, you may do so directly online through your account or by contacting
Pandora Listener Care at support@pandora.com

Right to Nondiscrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights
California consumers have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA and CPRA rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA and CPRA rights.
Verification
We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide and the type of request you are making. For your protection, you must provide sufficient information to verify your identity in order for us to fulfill a request to access, delete or correct personal information. Because Pandora collects limited information at registration, you must provide, and have access to, the email account associated with your Pandora account in order to complete the verification step. If you cannot receive email at the email address associated with your Pandora account, you will need to update the email address before submitting a request. If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.
Authorized Agents
If you are an authorized representative submitting a request on a California Consumer’s behalf, please submit the applicable request pursuant to these instructions along with a written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request, authorizing you to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state your full legal name and the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request and needs to be clear about the permission granted. Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in your submission the nature of your request. Both your identity and that of the consumer may be independently verified before we fulfill your request. We may ask the consumer to verify their identity directly with us, unless as an authorized agent, you are acting specifically pursuant to a power of attorney under the California Probate Code. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request. For the safety and security of our customers, any specific pieces of Personal Information requested under a CCPA Right to Access request will be returned to the requesting customer and not to an authorized agent, unless the authorized agent is acting specifically pursuant to a power of attorney under the California Probate Code.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center
.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account
. Stripe offers a service called "Link," which allows you to create an account and store information for future interactions with Stripe’s Services and Business Users. You may save a number of different kinds of Personal Data using Link. For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.
Learn More
.
You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe
. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.
Learn More
.
More
. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Users, including about your online activity and your engagement with our End User Services, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Users
Services
. We use and share your Personal Data to provide the End User Services to you, which includes support, personalization (such as language preferences and setting choices), and communication about our End User Services (such as communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, Stripe may use cookies and similar technologies or the data you provide to our Business Users (such as when you input your email address on a Business User’s website) to recognize you and help you use Link when visiting our Business User’s website. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies in Stripe’s
Cookie Policy
.
Our Business Users.
When you use Link to make payments with our Business Users, we share your Personal Data, including name, contact information, payment method details, and Transaction Data with those Business Users.
Learn More
. You can also direct Stripe to share your saved bank account information and identity documents with Business Users you do business with. Once we share your Personal Data with Business Users, we may process that Personal Data as a Data Processor for those Business Users, as detailed in Section 1.2 of this Policy.  You should consult the privacy policies of the Business Users’ you do business with for information on how they use the information shared with them.
Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention
. We use your Personal Data collected across our Services to detect fraud and prevent financial losses for you, us, and our Business Users and Financial Partners, including detecting unauthorized purchases. We may provide Business Users and Financial Partners, including those that use our fraud prevention-related Business Services (such as Stripe Radar), with Personal Data about you (including your attempted transactions) so that they can assess the fraud or loss risk associated with the transaction. Learn more about how we may use technology to assess the fraud risk associated with an attempted transaction and what information we share with Business Users and Financial Partners

and

.
Advertising
. Where permitted by applicable law, we may use your Personal Data, including Transaction Data, to assess your eligibility for, and offer you, other End User Services or promote existing End User Services, including through co-marketing with partners such as Stripe Business Users.
Learn more
. Subject to applicable law, including any consent requirements, we use and share End User Personal Data with third party partners to allow us to advertise our End User Services to you, including through interest-based advertising, and to track the efficacy of such ads. We do not transfer your Personal Data to third parties in exchange for payment, but we may provide your data to third-party partners, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and social networks, who assist us in advertising our Services to you.

More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center
, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing your Personal Data.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Customers
Transaction Data
. If you're an End Customer making payments to, receiving refunds or payments from, initiating a purchase or donation, or otherwise transacting with our Business User, whether in-person or online, we receive your Transaction Data. We may also receive your transaction history with the Business User.
Learn More
. Additionally, we may collect information entered into a checkout form even if you opt not to complete the form or transaction with the Business User.
Learn More
. A Business User who uses Stripe’s Terminal Service to provide its goods or services to End Customers may use the Terminal Service to collect End Customer Personal Data (like your name, email, phone number, address, signature, or age) in accordance with its own privacy policy.
Identity/Verification Information
. Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.
Learn More
.
More
. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Customers, including about your online activity, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers
To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them. Where allowed, we also use End Customers' Personal Data for Stripe’s own purposes such as enhancing security, improving and offering our Business Services, and preventing fraud, loss, and other damages, as described further below.
Payment processing and accounting
. We use your Transaction Data to deliver Payment-related Business Services to Business Users — including online payment transactions processing, sales tax calculation, and invoice, bill, and dispute handling — and to help them determine their revenue, settle their bills, and execute accounting tasks.
Learn More

How does Stripe protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse we use security measures to comply with federal law.  These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.  We impose access controls along with ongoing monitoring to prevent data misuse, and we require our service providers to take similar steps to protect your information.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
