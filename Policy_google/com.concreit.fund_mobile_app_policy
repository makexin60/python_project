Introduction
The website www.concreit.com, including any subdomain thereof (the “Site”) maintained by Concreit Inc. ("Concreit", “Company”, “we”, "our" or “us”) and mobile application (“App”), were created to provide you with information about our services, including our investment services and the content, services and/or products provided through our Site and App (collectively the “Services”). We value the privacy of our visitors (“you,” “your,” or “User”), and in order to protect your personal information, we have implemented the following Privacy Policy with provisions that apply to the collection of data by Concreit, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at help@concreit.com.
This Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Service and discloses the type and nature of information we collect and how we use it, as well as the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. We also explain how any requests for personal or personally identifiable information will be used. Finally, we present our security policy, which outlines how your personal information is protected. Each time you access, use, register with, or browse our Services you expressly consent to Concreit’s then-current Privacy Policy, and the policies and practices described therein.
Information We Collect
We collect personally identifiable and non-personal information from you when you visit our Services. The majority of information is collected during the registration of a User Account (defined below) and the use of the Services, and while some items are optional, most are required for legal or security purposes. You may choose to provide additional information during subsequent visits.
In general, the type of information we collect includes, but is not limited to:
Personal data required to verify your identity;
Personal and financial data necessary to assess your eligibility as an investor to utilize the Services; and
Non-identifiable and aggregated personal data pertaining to your visits that help us maintain the appropriate features, functionality and User experience.
Personal Data
Prior to entering the Services, you will be required to provide basic personal data. This information may include your name, address, citizenship, country of residence, and present location status. We use this data to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements.
Registration of an account (a “User Account”, and the registrant of a User Account is referred to as a “Registered User”) and using the Services will require you to provide, again or in addition, basic personal data. Such information may include your name, email address, a password, answers to security questions, home address, primary business address, country of residence, citizenship, phone number, date of birth, social security number and/or tax identification number, employment status and job title, passport number and expiration date, a copy of your valid government issued Photo I.D., educational history, investment knowledge and experience, central registration depository number if applicable, and other similar information. We use this data to: (i) register your User Account; (ii) establish your ability to view offering materials and to make investments through the Services (e.g., “accredited investor” status); (iii) verify your identity; (iv) guard against potential fraud; (v) contact you if there is a problem with your account; (vi) generally fulfill legal and regulatory requirements; and (vii) maintain regular communications with you as may be necessary to inform you of upcoming investment opportunities and other Company updates.
We will also gather the names and email addresses of Users who contact us through the Services with questions about our Company or the Services. We collect this information for the sole purpose of responding to such inquiries and do not store the contact information unless requested to do so, as in the case of job applicants who submit resumes.
Financial Data
When you subscribe to make an investment in one of our offerings, you will be asked for additional personal financial data, such as your net income, net worth, bank routing number or swift code, and bank account number to help facilitate the subscription process.
Non-Identifiable Data and Aggregated Personal Data
Regardless of whether you register a User Account, we may send one or more “cookies” to your computer. Cookies are small text files placed on your web browser when you visit our Site that store information on your computer, such as your Site preferences. We use cookies when you sign in to keep track of your personal session, including some account identifiers to ensure that you are the only person making changes to your account. We also use cookies to track your activity on the Site as a unique person. For security purposes, all of this information is stored in encrypted form. No personal information about you is stored.
You can set your web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or to prevent cookies from being set altogether. Please note, however, that if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality and slower Site response times. In some instances, declining to use our authentication-related cookies may prevent you from using the website entirely.
We, or our service providers, may also collect web surfing data related to your use of the Site. Such information may include: your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and internet service provider (ISP); your operating system; which of our web pages you access and how frequently you access them; referral or exit pages; click stream data; the dates and times that you visit the Site; and general geographical location. This data may be collected using cookies, web beacons, page tags or similar tools. As with cookies, the web surfing information is anonymous, “click stream” transactional data that is not associated with any Users as individuals.
Web surfing data and similar information may be aggregated for administrative purposes. We may, for example, use this aggregated information in the administration of the Site to improve its usability and to evaluate the success of particular marketing and advertising campaigns, search engine optimization strategies, and other marketing activities. We may also use it to help optimize the Site based on the needs of our Users.
How We Use Your Personal Information
Concreit uses your personal information to provide financial advice and other services; enhance your customer experience; improve our products and features; provide customer support; open, operate, and maintain your account in accordance with U.S law; investigate and understand how Concreit is used; monitor and protect the security and integrity of Concreit; and better market and advertise Concreit’s services. If you link external accounts to your Concreit account, we may use transactional data from thoseaccounts to provide you with financial advice or to recommend additional Concreit products and services to you. You understand and agree that Concreit will compare your identifying information with government-provided lists of suspected terrorists.
As part of this process, we will from time to time include, compile, or aggregate some of your personal information in certain data analyses, reports, or other interpretations of investment trends for both internal and external purposes. When including, compiling, or aggregating personal information for such purposes, we make sure that the information is anonymized such that it is not identifiable to any particular customer or website visitor.
If Concreit is unable to contact you over email because your email address returned an undeliverable message, you understand and agree that Concreit may make alternative attempts to contact you via phone,SMS text, mail, or other communication means. If you provide your phone number to Concreit, we may contact you by phone regarding opening and/or funding an account.
How and When Your Information Is Shared With Other Parties
We do not sell or rent personal information about our Users for marketing purposes.
Additional Sharing of User Information with Partners
However, we do share your personal information with our partners whose applications, websites and services may be integrated in our Services to perform vital functions with respect to the investment opportunities and customer support in our Services. Among others, we work with providers of hosting services for the Site, electronic signature providers, electronic payment service providers, analytics partners, and communication providers. We may engage partners to help us carry out certain other internal functions such as account processing, client services, or other data collection relevant to our business. Examples of partners might include those that perform data processing, reporting, tax documentation, custody, escrow or broker dealer services. Information is shared with these partners only to the extent necessary for us to process the transactions you initiate or perform, as well as other specific services, like collections.
Additional Sharing of User Information
We may share your information with law enforcement or other government agencies as required by law or for the purposes of limiting fraud. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, legal process, government request, or to comply with any applicable law or regulation, foreign or domestic. We further reserve the right to disclose any of your personal information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend against any third party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Services, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company, its Users, issuers, or others.
Additional Sharing of Registered User Content
If you use the Services to submit, post, transmit or share content you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit, post, transmit or share there can be read, collected, or used by other Registered Users of this forum and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit, post, transmit or share through the Services.
In addition, you hereby give us the right to produce any and all User content of any kind produced by you to county, state, and federal courts and/or government officials in response to a subpoena or other court order in the U.S., or in response to similar requests in other jurisdictions.
Change of Control
In the event that Concreit is consolidated, merged or sold, or in the event of a transfer or sale of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer information we collect in connection with the negotiation and/or conclusion of such a transaction.
Notifications and Communications From Our Site
As a User, you may opt in to receive email notifications advertising our Services. From time to time, we will also send you emails requesting for User feedback regarding User experience and Service operations. If you do not wish to receive these emails anymore, please send an email to help@concreit.com.
As a Registered User we will send you an email, and/or App, notifications from time to time. Some notifications are required elements of your transactions on our platform, such as confirmations of particular actions you have taken. These mandatory notices are typically sent to notify you of a change in status. For example, when you register as a User Account, you will receive emails confirming specific actions you requested. These will include emails to which you must respond to complete your registration and notifications confirming your registration. Thereafter, you will receive notifications when a new investment opportunity is offered, as well as updates concerning the progress of the funding of such offering and/or other relevant information. If you make an investment through the Services, we will also send you confirmations of the investment as well as occasional updates as to the status of that investment and the timing of distributions relating to that investment.
We also send out notices that are required for legal or security purposes. For example, certain notifications are sent for your own protection to ensure that another person cannot make a change to your User Account without your knowledge. In other cases, these notifications involve changes to various legal agreements or Service policies. Generally, you may not opt out of such service-related emails.
Where You Can View and Correct Your Information
We urge you to review your information regularly to ensure that it is correct and complete. If you believe that any of your information is incorrect, or if you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at help@concreit.com.
Links to Other Sites
If you follow any links that direct you away from the Services, this privacy policy will not apply to your activity on the other services you visit. We do not control the privacy policies or the privacy practices of any third parties.
International Users
The Services may be accessed by Users located outside of the United States. If you choose to use the Services from the European Union, Latin America, or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States, and that by providing your personal information on or through the Services, you consent to that transfer and waive your right to the protections of any local jurisdictional laws outside of the United States.
Security Policy
Access Limitations
We limit access to the personal information we have about you to those employees and other persons who have a legitimate business need to access such information. In keeping with industry standards and practices, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards and controls to protect your information. The Services are built upon a secure infrastructure with multiple layers of protection, and we use industry-standard encryption technologies to safeguard your information.
Registered Users are required to identify and authenticate themselves prior to accessing sensitive portions of the Services. Generally, identification and authentication take place through the use of your username and a password while logging in.
Notifications of Security Systems Breach
If we learn of a security systems breach, then we will attempt to notify you electronically or in writing so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on or through the Services in the event of a security breach.
Take Precautionary Measures
You can take several precautions to protect the security of your computer and personal information. For instance, you can use a well-chosen password and restrict access to your email account. You can also install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software to protect your computer from external attacks by malicious Users. When you are finished with a session on the Service, be sure that you log out and close the browser window.
You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your User Account information through "phishing," whereby scammers try to bring unsuspecting people to a website by using a genuine-looking email purporting to be from a legitimate company. Sometimes, either in the email itself or on this fake site, scammers will ask for login information to gain access to people's accounts and withdraw their money. We will never send you an email asking you for your login information. In general, you can protect yourself against phishing by never providing personal or login information via a link contained in an email; instead, go to the website directly. You might also make it a habit to check the URL of a website to be sure that it begins with the correct domain. In the case of the Company, you should always ensure the URL begins with https://www.concreit.com.
Transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure or error-free. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal information to Concreit or through Concreit’s Services via the Internet.
