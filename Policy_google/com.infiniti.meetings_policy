Categories of Information We Collect, Use and Disclose
.
INFINITI Financial Services
maintains additional privacy terms specific to credit and financing customers, which can be found at
Finance Privacy Notice
.
Understanding the Privacy Notice
Certain words used in the Privacy Notice may have meanings under privacy laws that differ from everyday usage. For example, consistent with many privacy laws, we use the term “collect” to mean both intentionally seeking data and passively receiving data that is incidental to other intentionally collected information or services.
There are a few other terms we want to define now as they are commonly designated by privacy laws to help you understand the Notice:
Affiliates
are entities that own, are owned by, or are under common ownership with INFINITI. They include entities like INFINITI Financial Services (Nissan Motor Acceptance Company), our financial services subsidiary. INFINITI retailers are not affiliates.
Service Providers
are companies that provide services to INFINITI. INFINITI’s contract with these Service Providers requires they not sell Personal Data they obtain through INFINITI or retain or use it for their own purposes.
Third Parties
are entities that are not affiliates. A few relevant examples include: (1) marketing or promotional partners that help INFINITI better understand its customers’ needs, (2) INFINITI retailers, or (3) in some instances, government entities. Sometimes, one company can be both a “Third Party” and a “Service Provider.”
Personal Data (sometimes referred to as Personal Information)
is data that can identify, relate to, describe, or be capable of being associated with or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular identified or identifiable person or household.
Geolocation
, as used in this Privacy Notice, refers to two types of location information:
General Geolocation
data, for example, your IP address, which could let us know the general area where you are located.
Precise Geolocation
, which is collected from sources such as navigation systems or connected vehicles that transmit where you are within a radius of 1,850 feet or less. We treat Precise Geolocation as Sensitive Personal Data and only use it or disclose it as described in this Privacy Notice.
De-identified information
is information that once contained identifying information but can no longer reasonably be used to infer information about or linked to an individual, or a device linked to an individual.
Platforms
are INFINITI-affiliated websites, mobile apps, connected vehicles, social media networks, and other INFINITI-owned or sponsored programs.
A
Cookie
is a piece of data stored on the user’s device containing information about the user’s device and interactions with a website. When this notice refers to a “Cookie,” it generally means Cookies and other online trackers unless otherwise noted. The term "
other online tracker technologies
” refers to tools such as pixels, gifs, beacons, and tags, which provide similar information. If a user rejects or deletes certain Cookies, our websites may not work properly.
Sensitive Personal Data
(sometimes referred to as Sensitive Personal Information)
is how we reference Personal Data that consumers might consider more sensitive. In most privacy laws, some common examples of Sensitive Personal Data would be Personal Data that reveal a consumer’s:
Social Security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number;
Log-in or financial account data in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account;
Precise Geolocation;
Racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs or union membership;
Contents of a consumer’s mail, email, and text messages unless INFINITI is the intended recipient of the communication;
Biometric information that is used for the purpose of uniquely identifying a consumer;
Personal Data collected concerning a consumer’s health
Server Log File Information
or
Log File
is information created when you visit our websites or other Platforms, including information such as IP address, browser type, referring and exit web pages, and your operating system.
You can view the Privacy Notice for U.S. consumers by expanding each of the sections below:
We collect Personal Data and non-Personal Data about you and your vehicle from our Platforms and other sources such as third-party services or public databases. INFINITI may create, use and disclose de-identified information. If we do so, we will take reasonable measures to keep the data de-identified, and we do not attempt to make that data identifiable.
What information does INFINITI collect from you?
INFINITI collects certain Personal Data in the ordinary course of business. There are a few categories of information we commonly collect:
Contact information
– name, email address, phone number, mailing address
Payment information
or related sensitive identification information
– when necessary (for example, an in-app purchase), we collect credit card information. Social Security numbers are collected in very limited circumstances (for example, to comply with state or federal tax laws if you win a contest or sweepstakes)
Geolocation
– when using INFINITI Platforms we may collect Geolocation Data. This can include General Geolocation or Precise Geolocation data
Demographic information
– zip code, age, date of birth, or gender
Service or warranty information
– vehicle information including when and what repairs you received for your vehicle
The Section of this Notice titled
Information We Collect, Use and Disclose
provides additional detail on what Personal Data we collect, including some other categories of information not referenced in this section.
How does INFINITI collect Personal Data?
Using both online and offline resources, INFINITI collects Personal Data when you:
Provide Personal Data to an INFINITI Platform, such as registering for, purchasing or using products or services such as when you buy a car, or enroll in a connected vehicle service like INFINITI InTouch and accept the terms and conditions of that enrollment
Post in public spaces, such as social media sites, or on any of our Platforms
Consent to receive emails, phone calls or texts
Participate in sweepstakes, special events, promotions, surveys, blogs or chats
Visit Platforms that utilize Cookies or other online trackers
In addition, INFINITI collects Personal Data from Affiliates, Third Parties and Service Providers, such as (1) when a retailer provides information to INFINITI, or (2) when another customer provides your information through our Platforms, such as when the customer might provide your email address to send a vehicle to you created through the Design Your Vehicle feature on our website. INFINITI also uses publicly or commercially available sources or data provider companies to collect Personal Data.
Usage data—collected over time and across devices—tells us how you use our Platforms, such as our website, and may be collected through Cookies, Log Files, pixels, and other tracking tools and technology embedded within our Platforms. We do not link this information with customer databases.
What Cookies We Use and Why
There are three categories of Cookies we use:
Required
– These Cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be disabled. They are usually only set in response to your actions that amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. If you block or set alerts for these Cookies, some our Platforms may not work properly.
Performance
– These Cookies count visits and traffic sources to measure and improve the performance of our site.
Targeting
– Our advertising partners may set these Cookies to build a profile and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. It may uniquely identify your browser and internet device.
We use Cookies and other web-based data collection technologies to:
Personalize and improve your use and navigation of our Platforms
We automatically gather Log Files and Cookies. We use this information to better understand how our website operates, administer our website and our technical solutions, and understand how our website visitors navigate through our websites and technical solutions to improve performance and enhance features. We also use this information to provide you with social sharing widgets or videos.
Market products and services to you
We use Log Files and Cookies to target advertising to you, and to measure advertising and promotional effectiveness, including by determining the pages you visit before and after visiting our website.
Digital advertising of INFINITI products at non-INFINITI websites may be facilitated by Service Providers or Third Parties, who may use Cookies to collect information about your visits to those sites, which we use to target our advertising to customer needs. Information collected may include the pages visited, date and time, browser information and/or IP address.
We also use this data to provide content to you from our third-party partners for products and services such as emergency service or accessories.
Do Not Track Options
Global Privacy Control
(“GPC”) is an add-on or browser preference that signals that you do not want Personal Data collected through third party tracking technology. INFINITI’s websites will honor GPC signals. INFINITI may not respond to non-GPC “do not track” (“DNT”) beacons, tags or other such signals including browser-based prompts or controls.
DNT is a privacy preference you can set in your web browser to indicate that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected across websites when you have not interacted with that service on the page. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
You also may receive tracking mechanisms from other parties prior to visiting our Platforms that will continue to track your activity while on our Platforms. Such data would be subject to the privacy policy of the other party from whom you received the tracking mechanism. We do not control or receive data from the other party’s tracking mechanisms.
For more information on how to manage advertising controls including tracking mechanisms, please visit
FTC Online Tracking
.
INFINITI and its Service Providers may collect and record information about you and your vehicle, either through information you provide to the retailer, or through Third Party connected services.
Connected Vehicle Data
If you have a connected vehicle, your vehicle may be equipped with INFINITI InTouch Services, which electronically transmits data generated by your vehicle. This information could include data collected in the context of a trial period or demonstration mode. Through these services, we may obtain vehicle and driving information, such as:
Vehicle operation
– including Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), Precise Geolocation and navigation information, speed and distance information, driving behavior, EV battery information (including use management, charging history and performance), electrical system functions, diagnostic trouble codes, maintenance conditions, software version information, and similar data
Vehicle usage
– your use of the vehicle’s functions and some corresponding services, websites and smartphone applications
Vehicle status
– information about door locks, open doors, engine status, etc.
Vehicle safety
– data about certain accidents involving the vehicle (for example, the direction from which the vehicle was hit, and which air bags have deployed)
Our Terms of Service and INFINITI InTouch Services agreement states that when you activate, register for, subscribe to, or use any of those services, you agree to INFINITI collecting and using the information collected for various purposes as described in this Privacy Notice and in the
INFINITI InTouch Services Subscriber Terms and Conditions
or other Platform Terms and Conditions (collectively, "Terms"). Separately, you may also receive specific disclosures provided at the time you consent to a feature or service. As the owner of an INFINITI vehicle, it is your responsibility to inform others who might drive or ride in your vehicle about the uses of data outlined in those Terms or in this Privacy Notice, or in any specific features or sevice disclosures as that consent applies to any non-owner occupants of your vehicle. INFINITI may ask for additional consent in some situations, including via in-vehicle notifications, but those notifications are not able to detect when a non-owner driver or passenger occupies the vehicle.
INFINITI uses Personal Data (except for Sensitive Personal Data) in various ways, such as to:
Tailor services to you
. We often use data to improve the services you receive. For example, we may use Personal Data to (1) effectively respond to customer service requests, (2) personalize existing product information, (3) administer warranty repairs, (4) provide targeted product or services marketing offers, or (5) notify you of winning a contest or sweepstakes.
Provide important product and safety information
. INFINITI uses Personal Data to ensure you are aware of relevant product information, including (1) safety-related alerts (such as recalls or service campaigns), (2) changes to INFINITI policies or practices, (3) announcements of new product features, (4) enablement of security features (protecting INFINITI vehicles, our Platforms, customers, employees, business partners or the general public), (5) administration of warranty repairs, or (6) recommended vehicle maintenance.
Facilitate customer experience
. From sale through ownership, we use Personal Data to help you use your product, such as processing orders or providing products or services for your vehicle, or enabling security features, including protecting against fraud or misuse.
Improve product and service quality
. INFINITI uses Personal Data to improve the quality of its vehicles and services. For example, INFINITI will use data to further study how to enhance vehicle quality, to perform market research to better meet customer needs, and to improve INFINITI Platforms.
Satisfy operational or legal requirements
. INFINITI is required to use Personal Data to comply with certain regulatory or legal requirements, such as to respond to federal statutory requirements or to respond to valid court orders, subpoenas, search warrants, or discovery requests in litigation.
In some circumstances, we combine information you provide with information provided by Third Parties or through public sources to better customize our services to your needs.
In addition, INFINITI uses de-identified information to compare it to vehicle usage trends among a larger number of users. We may also make your data anonymous for other purposes that do not identify you as the vehicle owner or user.
INFINITI may disclose Personal Data to Third Parties for the following purposes:
Operational or legal reasons
– (1) to facilitate operational functions (such as recall or service campaign mailings) or audit or legal functions, (2) for product safety, engineering, warranty, or related data analysis and product development functions (generally with Service Providers, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., or other Nissan or INFINITI entities), (3) to comply with a valid legal, regulatory, or court process (for example a valid subpoena, court order or warrant or discovery request), (4) to provide to any successor to any aspect of our business (if INFINITI sells any portion of its business, the new owner may access Personal Data through that transaction) or to Third Parties in the event of a merger, transfer of ownership or assets, bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization.
Providing services or marketing
– (1) to our Affiliates or INFINITI retailers for operational or business purposes such as providing services to you or for joint marketing initiatives, (2) to Service Providers, such as SiriusXM, to provide INFINITI InTouch Services, or (3) to Third Parties we contract with for a specific business-related purpose (for example, website hosts, Service Providers, email platform providers, advertisers or those running promotions on INFINITI’s behalf).
Results
The following chart identifies broad categories of Personal Data as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and provides information on the specific types of Personal Data within those broad categories that INFINITI collects for all U.S. Consumers (as allowed by law) based on your interactions with INFINITI and the consent(s) you have provided where needed. The chart also identifies how INFINITI uses the data, how INFINITI collected the data (from where or from whom did we receive it), and when and to whom INFINITI disclosed the Personal Data for a business purpose in the last 12 months.
Some state laws define the “sale” of Personal Data as any instance of disclosing that data to a Third Party for any benefit, even if no money is exchanged. Where a disclosure is considered a “sale” under state privacy laws in California or elsewhere, we have highlighted these instances by describing the disclosure in
bold and underline
.
In addition to the information provided in the chart, please note:
In the course of business we may unintentionally receive some Personal Data not described below (for example, if you contact our customer support function and include in your email some Personal Data we do not request). Though we try to eliminate any unrequested, unneeded information, there may be cases in which this Personal Data remains in our systems for some period of time.
In the Data INFINITI Collects/Uses column below, we identify certain types of data we collect and use in order to illustrate which types of data points fall within the broad category we actively collect and use. This column does not include every possible example and there may be similar data points that the chart does not explicitly disclose, but we have provided representative examples that explain the most common uses of each type of data described. For example, this column discloses that we may collect and use postal address, which is intended as a general statement that may encompass similar data points, such as current postal address, former postal address, and secondary mailing address.
Like all companies, INFINITI has a legal obligation to share some Personal Data with government entities in certain situations. For example, we are required to share Personal Data such as name and social security number to the IRS when we pay someone (such as a sweepstakes or contest winner). We are also obligated to provide certain limited Personal Data according to the terms of a subpoena, court order, search warrant or if requested by a legal organization in case of a lawsuit. We only supply such information with appropriate documentation, and we provide the minimum amount required to protect our legal status or to meet our compliance or legal requirements.
INFINITI shares some information with our affiliated INFINITI companies in order to facilitate business we do together and accomplish our shared business goals. For example, we may share your name and contact information, along with the VIN of a vehicle you have purchased, with our affiliated NMAC organization to facilitate an auto loan you have requested. Similarly, telematics data that includes Precise Geolocation may be stored in global Nissan databases or used by global teams to analyze or improve the safety of our vehicles or as otherwise outlined in the Disclosure of Information section above.
INFINITI uses Service Providers to help us with our IT systems, data management, security, and software applications that may hold or interact with Personal Data. We do use these Service Providers to help ensure that the data is protected in accordance with high industry standards. We share the Personal Data in most of the broad categories described in the Data INFINITI Collects/Uses column with these Service Providers and obtain assurances from those vendors that limit the ways in which they are allowed to use your data.
Although INFINITI uses “sale” below as required by state privacy laws in California and elsewhere, we think you should know that
INFINITI does not create or sell any customer inference profiles. INFINITI does not sell any driving activity data to insurance companies for programs that might directly impact your premiums unless you have consented or asked an insurance company to retrieve this information, nor do we sell personal data to marketing companies to send you advertising for products or services that are not related to INFINITI.
To the extent your phone number is obtained for the specific purpose of an SMS messaging campaign governed by an Application-to-person (A2P) 10 digit long code (10 DLC) registration submitted to the Campaign Registry, your phone number will be used solely pursuant to the terms you consent to when you enroll in that specific offer and not shared with any Third Parties.

· Conduct analytical and marketing activities
We can receive this information online or offline and receive most of this information directly from consumers and potential customers through our Platforms and other direct interactions, such as customer support, or from a retailer when a vehicle is purchased from them. If you are a dealership employee or employee of a Third Party with whom Nissan does business, such as a vendor or supplier, we may receive information that contains Identifiers about you, either as part of a business-to-business communication or for purposes of dealer-to-INFINITI business functions associated with vehicles sales or service.
We also may obtain information from social media and data provider companies to make sure that we have accurate contact information. For example, we may obtain an email address or a phone number from data provider companies in order to contact individuals about important recall or service campaign information.
We use Service Providers to provide services and conduct some of our business activities and may provide or provide access to some identifiers in order for them to provide us service.
Examples of Service Providers to which we may provide identifier information include marketing vendors, vendors that host data or software applications that INFINITI uses in its business, and data analytics vendors. We may use Third Party marketing providers to launch advertising campaigns, and we might need to provide them email address and name for each of the intended recipients of the advertising campaign.
In order to participate together in important services and programs, such as warranty and recall programs, we may disclose identifiers to INFINITI retailers.
Where we share this information with retailers or Third Parties in service of joint marketing programs, this sharing can also constitute a “sale” under some state laws.
We may share some limited information, such as IP address, with our network of advertising vendors in a way that could constitute a “sale” under some state laws.
Identifiers that identify a vehicle
Example:
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
In order to use as little Personal Data as possible while still fulfilling necessary services, business activities, and obligations, we often use Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) as the primary identifier of a vehicle.
For example, we use VINs to link a recall or warranty item with the correct vehicle.
We receive VINs primarily through INFINITI retailers, or through direct customer input through our Owner Portal or other online/mobile applications.
We use Service Providers to provide services and conduct some of our business activities and may provide directly or provide access to vehicle identifiers in order for them to provide us service.
Examples of Service Providers to which we may provide identifier information include marketing vendors, vendors that host data or software applications that INFINITI uses in its business, and data analytics vendors.
In order to participate together in important services and programs, such as warranty and recall programs, we may disclose vehicle identifiers to INFINITI retailers.
Where we share this information with retailers in service of joint marketing programs, this sharing can also constitute a “sale” under some state laws.
Online identifiers
Examples:
IP address
Device ID
When you visit our websites or mobile applications, those sites typically collect some automated information from your computer, including the IP address. An IP address can give us information about your general location, such as your country or state.
We use this information to identify unique visitors to our Platforms, customize Platform experiences, and if you have expressed interest in a vehicle or service to suggest a retailer that may be close to your general location.
Your computer browser or device provides us this information directly.
We may use website data analytics Service Providers to analyze our online data, in which case these Service Providers may have access to your IP address and/or device ID in the course of providing service to us.
We may also use advertising Service Providers to help us deliver ads to you on our websites and other websites.
In other cases, advertising Third Parties may be part of an advertising network and we may share your IP address with these Third Parties to help us and other companies deliver targeted online ads. This last sharing may constitute a “sale” under some state laws.
Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80€)

Address
Telephone number
As referenced above in "Identifiers that identify a person," we may have and share your name and contact information.

In addition to Service Providers which may receive your name and contact information for purposes disclosed above in "Identifiers that identify a person," we also may use Service Providers to assist us with business services related to your signature.
For example, if you have applied to become a retailer owner, we will ask for your consent for the necessary background check through a signature, which we provide to the Service Provider conducting all or some of the background check.
In order to participate together in important services and programs, such as warranty and recall programs, we may provide signatures to INFINITI retailers, as well as other business partners that provide you related services you request and we facilitate.
For example, if you enroll in INFINITI InTouch Services and provide your signature on enrollment documentation, we will provide that documentation -including your signature - to our INFINITI InTouch Service Provider, Sirius XM, to confirm that you have authorized your enrollment.

We use this information
· To Respond to service requests, airbag deployment or severe impact
· If your vehicle appears to be, or you report that it has been, stolen
· As required by applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and judicial orders
· To administer and improve INFINITI’s Platforms
· To improve the services provided to you
· Vehicle-specific, non-sensitive information may be used for marketing purposes
We obtain this information directly from your vehicle.
We use Service Providers to help us conduct some of our business activities and may need to provide some Personal Data in order for them to provide service.
We may provide this information to Affiliates in connection with our attempts to communicate with you or recover your vehicle pursuant to agreements governing the lease or financing of your vehicle.
Where we share Personal Information with retailers in service of joint marketing programs, this sharing can also constitute a “sale” under some state laws.
INFINITI stores your Personal Data in the United States but may also store your data on servers located in other countries. Regardless of location, INFINITI safeguards and handles your Personal Data with similar protections. Please note that vehicles intended for sale in the US market are designed to transmit data to systems in the United States even if the vehicle is later exported by the purchaser.  Your consent to transmit data back to the United States is obtained as part of the Terms of Service you agree to when you enroll in certain services.
INFINITI retains your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the business purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, including to the extent necessary to comply with our legal, accounting, or regulatory reporting obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. Additionally, we may continue to store all categories of your Personal Data contained in our standard data back-up storage for a limited period of time.
For Personal Data that you upload for your own purposes (for example, a profile photo in the INFINITI InTouch application), you are always able to delete it from your account by removing the data.
We also will retain usage data for internal analysis purposes. Usage data (see
Information We Collect through Cookies
) is generally retained for less time, except when usage data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Platforms, services, or products, or we are legally obligated to retain them for a specific time.
Unsubscribe From Marketing Communications
To unsubscribe from marketing communications, please click the “unsubscribe” link included in our marketing emails, visit

, or contact INFINITI through one of the various methods provided in the
How to Contact Us
section. If you choose not to receive marketing communications from us, you still may receive communications regarding certain operational or regulatory necessities that are unrelated to marketing.
Opt-Out of Connected Vehicle Services
Customers who prefer not to have their connected vehicle information collected through INFINITI InTouch Services can decline services in three ways:
By declining or limiting services within the vehicle or Application,
By logging into the
INFINITI Owners Portal
and clicking on “Delete Vehicle & Unsubscribe,” or
By contacting a Customer Care representative at
1-844-711-8100
.
If you elect to stop collection of this information, connected vehicle services will be limited or unavailable to you. Independent of subscription status, some limited vehicle data may be collected to improve vehicle safety, quality and services related to the vehicle, or to comply with legal obligations.
Opt-out of some Cookies
If you wish to opt-out of INFINITI advertising and/or non-essential analytics and functional/ preference Cookies, you can do so by interacting with the Cookie consent banner at the bottom of INFINITI websites, or by clicking
Cookie Settings
.
You also may opt-out of how other companies use tracking tools and collect your information while visiting our websites by (1) visiting each of their privacy policies and following their instructions, or (2) using two tools made available by the Digital Advertising Alliance to register your choices about the collection and use of your data on mobile sites and across sites and applications for online targeted advertising by visiting
Your AdChoices
and
AppChoices Tool
.
If you have given consent through your mobile device, the Precise Geolocation of your mobile device also may be transmitted to our servers. You may stop allowing us to have access to your device’s location information by accessing the app’s location settings on your device and setting your device not to share its location with us.
In some states, as described below, you may have the right to opt out of certain uses or disclosures of your information. Please note that because we do not link your Cookie information with your account information, opting out of Cookies will not opt you out of other uses or disclosures of other Personal Data. To opt out of such uses and disclosures, if applicable to you, please visit our
Opt-Out Request Form.
Depending on where you live in the United States, you may be entitled to rights with respect to Personal Data we have collected and used. Some, but not all, states have applicable consumer data protection laws. Those laws—and your rights—differ from state to state. This section details the rights you may have, and how you may exercise them if applicable. These rights do not cover legal entities, such as companies.
Certain states may allow you to designate an authorized agent to make a rights request on your behalf. We will deny requests from agents that do not submit appropriate proof of authorization from you or when a state does not authorize these requests for a specific type of privacy right. To verify that an authorized agent has authority to act for you, we may, if allowed or required by applicable laws, reach out to you directly to confirm, require a copy of a power of attorney, or require that you provide the authorized agent with written permission and verify your own identity with us.
We don’t want your rights to be confusing or hard to exercise.  If you want to make a request or have a question, see the
How to Contact Us
section below. If you reside in a state with an active consumer data protection law, the following rights may apply, and INFINITI outlines which requests are honored in various jurisdictions in our
Privacy Rights Request Form:
The right to access and receive your specific Personal Data
The right to correct Personal Data collected, disclosed, or sold
The right to request deletion of Personal Data about you
The right to opt out of the sale of Personal Data, or use of Personal Data for targeted advertising or cross-contextual behavioral advertising
The right to either limit or require consent to process Sensitive Personal Data
The right to appeal a Controller’s refusal to take action regarding a privacy rights request
The right to non-discrimination for the exercise of a consumer’s privacy rights
These rights will not apply, however, if INFINITI does not collect any Personal Data about you, if you are not a resident of a state with a consumer data protection law in effect, or if all of the information we collect is exempt from the applicable statute. For example, applicable consumer data protection laws do not generally protect information that is already publicly available. These rights are described in further detail below.
To exercise your rights, please visit the
“Exercising Your Privacy Rights”
section below.
1. The Right to Know About and/or Access a Portable Copy of Personal Data Collected, Disclosed, or Sold
Certain state residents have the right to request that INFINITI disclose what Personal Data it collects, uses, discloses, and sells. This is called the “Right to Know.” Depending on the relevant State, under the Right to Know, you can ask and receive an answer about whether we have collected information about you, and/or what information we have collected and/or shared. You will also receive a listing of the types of Personal Data we have collected about you, the sources of that information, how we use the information, other individuals and businesses with whom we share Personal Data, and the specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you. For further details about this information, please visit
Categories of Information We Collect, Use and Disclose
above.
If you would like additional information under your Right to Know and/or Access, you may contact us through our website or customer service.
(See How to Contact Us
)
When you make a request under your Right to Know and/or Access, you can expect the following:
We will verify your identity. We will ask that you provide us with certain information such as your name, email address, physical address, VIN, or other information, in order for us to confirm that you are who you say you are.
We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the website or phone number listed below in How to Contact Us.
We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need additional time to respond where allowed by law, but we will reply either way within the initial legally required period and, if we need more time, we will explain why.
In certain cases, a Request to Know and/or Access may be denied. For example, we may deny a request if we cannot verify your identity or if providing you the information could create an unreasonable risk to someone’s security (to prevent very sensitive information from being disclosed inappropriately). If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it. If we deny a request, we will still try to provide you as much of the information as we can, but we will withhold the information subject to denial.
2. The Right to Correct Personal Data Collected, Disclosed, or Sold
Certain state residents have the right to request that INFINITI correct the Personal Data it collects (to the extent it is commercially reasonable), uses, discloses, and sells. This is called the “Right to Correct.”
If you would like additional information under your Right to Correct, you may contact us through our website or customer service. Details on how to make a request in each state are listed below.
When you make a request under your Right to Correct, you can expect the following:
After you request correction, you will need to specify the information you believe we have recorded incorrectly.
We will verify your identity. You will need to provide us with certain information such as your name, email address, physical address, VIN or other information, in order for us to confirm that you are who you say you are.
We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the website or phone number below in
How to Contact Us
.
We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, but we will reply either way within the first 45-day period and, if we need more time, we will explain why.
In most cases, you will need to submit documentation to support your requested correction. For example, if you believe your mailing address is incorrect in our records, you will need to provide evidence of the correct mailing address. If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it.
3. The Right to Request Deletion of Personal Data about You
Certain state residents have a right to request the deletion of their Personal Data collected or maintained by INFINITI. If you would like information about you to be deleted, you may contact us through our website or customer service.
When you make a request for deletion, you can expect the following:
After you request deletion, you will need to confirm that you want your information deleted.
We will verify your identity. We will ask that you provide us with certain information such as your name, email address, physical address, VIN, or other information, in order for us to confirm that you are who you say you are.
We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the website or phone number listed below in
How to Contact Us
.
We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, but we will reply either way within the first 45-day period and, if we need an extension, we will explain why.
In certain cases, a request for deletion may be denied. If we cannot verify your identity, the law requires that we maintain the information (e.g., in case of warranty or recall information); or we may need the information for internal purposes such as to continue to provide you services. If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it, and delete any other information that is not protected from deletion.
4. The Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Data, Profiling, or use of Personal Data for Targeted Advertising or Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising
Residents of certain states have a right to opt-out of the sale of their Personal Data and/or targeted or cross-context behavioral advertising or “profiling” in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects by INFINITI. For more information about your right to opt-out, please see our
Notice of Right to Opt-Out.
Please note, however, that at this time INFINITI does not conduct this type of “profiling,” so that is not a type of opt-out that we specifically honor.
For Cookie-related opt out requests, please see the
Information We Collect through Cookies
, which is handled separately from your right to opt out of the sale and/or targeting or cross-context behavioral advertising.
5. The Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Information or Require Consent to Process Sensitive Personal Data
California residents have a right to limit the use or disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data, including one’s Precise Geolocation, by INFINITI.
California law provides some exempted uses of Sensitive Personal Data that are not subject to Requests to Limit the Use or Disclosure. INFINITI’s uses and disclosures of Sensitive Personal Data fall within those exemptions. Depending on how you are using INFINITI Platforms, there may be other ways that you can limit the scope of how we use data we receive from you or you may opt out of certain data uses separate from making a Request to Limit the Use or Disclosure request.  For more information about these options, please see
Your Choices about Collection, Use and Sharing of Personal Data
above.
Other state laws require we obtain your consent before processing your Sensitive Personal Data. We will obtain consent from you wherever required.
6. The Right to Appeal a Business or Controller’s Refusal to Take Action
Certain state residents have a specialized right to appeal where a consumer’s privacy rights-related request is denied in whole or in part. To appeal your request, please follow the instructions provided in the communication denying your related request.
7. The Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights
You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of your privacy rights conferred by your state’s consumer privacy laws. INFINITI will not discriminate against any consumer because such person exercised any of the consumer’s rights under these privacy laws, including, but not limited to
Denying goods or services
Charging different prices or rates for goods and services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties
Providing a different level or quality of goods or services
Suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services
INFINITI may, however, charge a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is related to the value provided to INFINITI by your data.  For example, if you are receiving an incentive subscription rate related to your agreement to provide Personal Data for INFINITI’s retention or disclosure, and you exercise your rights described above, your incentive pricing may be discontinued.
To make a request related to your rights under applicable consumer data protection laws or the Nevada Privacy Law, you may call 1-877-647-2272 for more information or visit our
Privacy Rights Request Form
.
For more information about your right to opt-out, please see our Notice of Right to Opt-Out. To opt out of certain uses or disclosures of your information, please visit our
Opt Out Request Form

We are committed to keeping your information secure. We have appropriate technical, administrative and physical procedures and information security policies in place, designed to safeguard your information from loss, misuse, or alteration. However, even effective security measures cannot guarantee that data will never be inappropriately accessed. For example, INFINITI cannot guarantee that communications transmitted through wireless or satellite networks will not be intercepted by unauthorized individuals. You agree that INFINITI is not liable for any damages for any alleged or actual loss of privacy occurring in connection with communication over wireless or satellite networks. We will keep the information we collect in accordance with this Privacy Notice and our document retention policies.
If you have any questions about the security of our Platforms or services, you can send an email to
privacy@nissan-usa.com

INFINITI Platforms, including websites, may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that INFINITI is not responsible for the privacy or other practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Platforms and to read the privacy statements of each website that collects Personal Data. This Privacy Notice applies solely to information collected through our vehicles and through our Platforms where this Privacy Notice is posted, linked or referenced.
It is your obligation to correct or update the information you provide when you buy or lease an INFINITI vehicle or subscribe to INFINITI InTouch Services. If that information changes and you do not notify us, e.g., of a sale or transfer of your vehicle, we may continue to send reports or other information about the vehicle or the account to the email or address currently on file with us and/or new owner. In such case, pursuant to the INFINITI InTouch Services Subscriber Terms and Conditions, we are not responsible for any privacy related damages you may suffer. You are responsible for (i) notifying any purchaser of your vehicle with INFINITI InTouch Services regarding the service terms of the INFINITI InTouch Services and this Privacy Notice, and (ii) any damages arising from your failure to provide such notice.
You may update your information by calling INFINITI InTouch Services Support at 1-855-426-6628 or updating online at the

INFINITI’s Platforms are not intended for children under 13 years of age. INFINITI does not knowingly allow anyone under the age of 13 to participate in any services offered on our Platforms that require the submission of user information. If we learn that a user is under 13 and has submitted user information to us, we will delete that information promptly or seek verifiable parental or legal guardian consent to retain such information.
INFINITI does not sell or share the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age and has no actual knowledge of any such sales or disclosures.
In partnership with certain school systems, INFINITI offers some high school students access to our Virtual Academy in order to provide a unique and beneficial educational component to students with an interest in the automotive industry.  That program collects minimal data including name, school name/school address, expected graduation date, and email. None of the data collected for purposes of this program is ever sold or shared and is used solely for the purpose of permitting software log-in.
INFINITI reserves the right to update its Privacy Notice from time to time. If we do, we will notify you if required by applicable law. We will use, share, provide to Third Parties for commercial purposes, and disclose all information in accordance with the Privacy Notice in effect at the time the information was collected, unless we have obtained your consent for any material changes to such use, sharing, or disclosure as required by law. You should periodically check for notices and updates to our Privacy Notice and terms of service. Your use of INFINITI Platforms or services after any such updates have been made or we have notified you if required by applicable law constitutes your acceptance, regardless of whether you have reviewed the updates.
Some of our products and services, including but not limited to INFINITI’s mobile apps and certain services offered through INFINITI InTouch Services, may be provided in collaboration with other vendors or business partners and are governed by their own terms and conditions that should be read together with this Privacy Notice. If any such terms and conditions conflict with this Privacy Notice, the terms and conditions of the other vendor or business partner will govern.
While INFINITI’s retailers share certain information with us, and while all information we obtain from our retailers is treated in accordance with this Privacy Notice, our retailers are separate legal entities that are not governed by the terms of this Privacy Notice. Information regarding our retailers’ privacy practices can be found on the retailers’ websites or by contacting them directly.

Purpose and Scope
Nissan North America, Inc. (“Nissan” or “we”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our employees, retirees, interns, job applicants and contractors (persons employed by a company with whom Nissan has contracted for services and whose workers perform work on behalf of Nissan), as well as individuals whose information we may receive from such employees and contractors (such as health plan participants or beneficiaries of insurance policies).
This Employment and Contractor Privacy Notice explains the Personal Information Nissan collects and handles about United States-based employees, retirees, interns, job applicants, and contractors and their dependents and family members whose information we receive from them in each of their respective roles. This Notice only applies to employees, retirees, interns, job applicants, and contractors of Nissan and individuals whose information we receive from them and does not cover workers of other Nissan subsidiaries or Affiliates, including our financial services subsidiary, Nissan Motor Acceptance Company LLC.
Employees, retirees, interns, job applicants, and contractors who are also customers of Nissan are also covered by the Nissan Privacy Notice (available at
Privacy Notice
) in their capacity as customers. This privacy statement does not cover privacy practices related to Nissan’s customers, prospective customers, or users of Nissan Platforms.
Understanding the Privacy Notice
Certain words used in the Privacy Notice may have meanings that differ from everyday usage.  For example, consistent with many privacy laws, we use the term “collect” to mean both intentionally seeking data and passively receiving data that is incidental to other intentionally collected information or services.
There are a few other terms we want to define now as they are commonly designated by privacy laws to help you understand the Notice:
Affiliates
are entities that own, are owned by, or are under common ownership with Nissan North America, Inc. They include entities like Nissan Motor Acceptance Company, our financial services subsidiary. Nissan dealers and INFINITI retailers are not Affiliates.
Service Providers
are companies that provide services to Nissan. Nissan’s contract with these Service Providers requires that they not sell Personal Data they obtain through Nissan or retain or use it for their own purposes. In the employment context, an example might be a health insurance company contracted with Nissan to provide employee healthcare benefits.
Third Parties
are entities that are not Affiliates. A few relevant examples include: (1) healthcare providers, (2) Nissan dealers or INFINITI retailers, or (3) in some instances, government entities. Sometimes, one company can be both a “Third Party” and a “Service Provider.”
Personal Data
or
Personal Information
is data that can identify, relate to, describe, or be capable of being associated with or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular identified or identifiable person or household.
Geolocation
, as used in this Privacy Notice, refers to two types of location information:
General Geolocation
data, for example, your IP address, which could let us know the general area where you are located.
Precise Geolocation
, which is collected from things like navigation systems or connected vehicles that transmit where you are within a radius of 1,750 feet or less. We treat Precise Geolocation as Sensitive Personal Data and do not use or share it except as described in this Notice or the
Privacy Notice
.
Platforms
are Nissan-affiliated websites, mobile apps, connected vehicles, social media networks, and other Nissan-owned or sponsored programs or mobile devices.
Sensitive Personal Data
or
Sensitive Personal Information
is how we reference  Personal Data that consumers might consider more sensitive. In most privacy laws, some common examples of Sensitive Personal Data would be Personal Data that reveals an individual’s:
Social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number;
Log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account;
Precise Geolocation;
Racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs or union membership;
Contents of a consumer’s mail, email, and text messages unless Nissan is the intended recipient of the communication;
Genetic data;
Biometric information that is used for the purpose of uniquely identifying a consumer;
Personal Information collected concerning a consumer’s health; or
Personal Information that could reveal a consumer’s sex life or sexual orientation.
Personal Information
For more details on the exact Personal Information we collect, please see
Personal Information Nissan Collects, Uses and Discloses
. Personal Information we might collect includes data such as the following:
Contact information
– name, email address, phone number, mailing address
Banking information
– if you sign up for direct deposit or otherwise provide us with such information (for reasons such as expense reimbursement)
Precise Geolocation
– may be collected if you use a Nissan connected vehicle as part of your duties
Demographic information
– zip code, age, date of birth, or gender
Social Security number
Employment and related information
– information you provide in a resume or that we obtain in a background check, or what we record about your Nissan employment history, employee identification number, national or state identification numbers, passport number and dependent information for the administration of certain employee benefits or programs.
Sources of Personal Information
We may collect Personal Information about you in the following ways:
Directly from you through our and our Service Providers’ online systems/websites and/or mobile application(s), vehicles, and/or through paper documents.
From Third Parties for business purposes. For example, we may obtain updated address information from a data provider company if we need to contact former employees.
Optionally and voluntarily, job applicants, contractors or employers of contractors can provide online information, such as LinkedIn information or through other social media channels.
Use of Personal Information
We may use your information, including Personal Information, to:
Initiate, maintain and manage our relationship with you
Test our products if that is within the scope of your role
Protect our legal and business interests, and fulfill our legal obligations

Personal Information Nissan Collects, Uses and Discloses
We may collect and may have collected and/or stored and used the following categories of your Personal Information within the preceding 12 months. Each category, except as noted in Disclosure of Personal Information above, may be disclosed to Service Providers for purposes directly related to your employment in the human resources context, or in order for us to provide you benefits.
Identifiers and Government IDs
We may collect your name, alias, phone number, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, internet protocol (IP) address, email address, Social Security number, driver’s license number, vehicle registration, passport number, visa information or other similar identifiers and emergency contacts for your company-provided benefits and personal safety. If you are an employee, intern or job applicant, we also may collect similar information from you about dependents and beneficiaries.
Statutory Personal Information Categories
Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)) including Identifiers and Government IDs listed above and also bank account number, credit card number, and debit card number if you provide this information to us.
Characteristics of Protected Classifications
As part of fulfilling and managing your working relationship with us, we may collect, directly from you or, in the case of contractors, your employer, information about you and your dependents’ or beneficiaries’ sex, age/date of birth, military status, marital status, race/ethnicity, gender, and disability status. If you apply for a job with us and/or are hired, we also may ask you (or, for contractors, your employer) to provide us information about your citizenship status that likely includes information concerning your national origin. We or your employer also may conduct background checks that reveal criminal history and perform a drug screening or ask employers of contractors to do so and share the results with us.
Health Information
As part of administering company-provided benefits for employees, to assist in providing them on-site health benefits, to meet applicable legal requirements (e.g., compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act), and as part of our relationship with employees and contractors (e.g., if they call in sick), we may obtain knowledge of their and their dependents’/spouse’s/partner’s diagnoses, treatments, and other health information. In the course of efforts to protect you, Nissan workers, contractors, and visitors, from illnesses, we may collect and use limited health information, such as proof of vaccination status and/or infection status.
Depending on your role at Nissan, we may require a Department of Transportation certification that includes health information. Some roles may require a physical exam to confirm ability to perform certain duties.
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identification
For employees that participate in a health plan, and including others as plan participants, Nissan may receive information about the gender of your spouse or partner, which can indirectly lead to knowledge of sexual orientation. You also may volunteer information of gender identification as part of the job application process. Additionally, as part of our diversity, equity and inclusion programs and activities, you may volunteer information of sexual orientation and/or gender identification.
Finances
Nissan may in certain circumstances conduct background checks in accordance with law that include financial information or ask employers of contractors to do so and share with Nissan such information, such as information about your credit and loans, bankruptcies and delinquent accounts. Employees and/or their family also may provide certain financial information related to benefits and/or programs. Nissan also requires certain banking information related to wages and other payments to you if you are paid directly for any reason.
Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information
In order to protect our assets and consistent with company policy, we may use technology and manual reviews to identify and take action related to your email, document download, and/or internet behavior (including social media). According to our policies and/or in case of an investigation, we also may research your work behavior, internet usage on our network, emails associated with your Nissan email account, or other electronic data related to our investigation. Some customer service representatives may record, through an online interface, their unavailability for calls and reasons for unavailability, which supervisors and managers review. Similarly, some work-related applications, such as instant messaging applications, may display a user’s online or offline status, which colleagues, supervisors and managers may review.
Geolocation and Other Connected Vehicle Data
If you use a Nissan-sponsored mobile application, operate a connected vehicle, or otherwise utilize Nissan Platforms, the application or Platform may track your Precise Geolocation. For more information about Personal Information collected through vehicles, please review our general

.
Audio and Visual Information
If you work in or visit a Nissan facility in which we have security cameras in place, we may capture your image and audio on CCTV cameras. Similarly, in the event you present on a recorded meeting via Zoom or other video conferencing software, we might capture audio and video of you as a speaker pursuant to internal policies. We may also capture audio and video of you when you test drive our vehicles or interact with new products, if that is within the scope of your role.
Professional or Employment-Related Information
When you apply for a job with us, or we consider you for a contractor position, we may collect your resume or similar information about your background and skills from you or your employer or past employer. If you are selected, we may conduct verification checks, or ask your employer to do so, such as reviewing motor vehicle records, employment history, and educational history. If you are hired, or become a contractor, we may use a portion of the information you shared in the application process to set up our working relationship together or, as applicable, your employment file which may give you the ability to apply for other internal positions.
As you continue to work for us or continue as a contractor, we may collect from you, directly or indirectly through manager or employer’s feedback and internal systems, information about your Nissan job role(s), pay, job progression, job-related credentials, performance, and reporting structure. This may include information on any disciplinary actions or performance improvement plans.
For employees, we collect, directly from you, information needed to manage your company-provided benefits, including leave of absence, health, and payment information. If you participate in voluntary employment programs, like the employee lease program, we may collect information from and about you and/or others associated with the program needed to confirm eligibility, confirm insurance, deduct agreed-upon costs, manage tax and legal liability, and manage your participation in the program.
If you work at a Nissan facility or remotely in a role that requires that you handle Personal Information, Nissan may audit or review your adherence to policies that address the privacy and security of data you handle. During these reviews, Nissan may obtain visual confirmation of your work environment and equipment’s compliance.
Education Information
When you apply for a job with us or we consider you for a contractor position, we may collect your resume or similar documents from you or your employer or past employer that include education information. As you continue to work for us, we may capture from you, directly or indirectly through shared business documents or from the employer of contractors, information about your professional credentials, which may include your degree(s), work experience and other educational efforts.
As you sign up for and complete voluntary or required training courses, we may have records regarding any courses where you have registered, the completion status of each course, and, in some cases, whether you have successfully passed any related testing.
Sensitive Personal Information
As described above, as an employee, intern, contractor or beneficiary, we may collect information that is considered sensitive including driver’s license number, national or state identification number, citizenship status, immigration status, race, national origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, Precise Geolocation, health diagnosis data, and genetic information. Except as otherwise explained in Disclosures of Personal Information above, we do not disclose such information except as required by law or with your consent.
Note that Nissan does not sell employee, job applicant or contractor-related Personal Information, nor do we disclose it for targeted advertising.
