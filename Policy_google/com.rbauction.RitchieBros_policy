What personal information we collect and process
Other than as part of applying for financing with Ritchie Bros. Financial Services, most of the information we collect, and process, is equipment or vehicle related information and business contact information relating to, and provided by, our customers’ employees or other representatives.  In general, information is collected when a customer engages one of our brand solutions to provide services by entering a contract, creating an online account, coming into one of our auction locations, providing us information through a webform, or otherwise interacting with us.  Information may also be obtained from other sources.  For instance, brand solutions may share information internally, or an outside service provider is used to verify or supplement what we’ve received.  In some cases, the information we obtain is generated automatically when users engage with our digital properties, such as browsing and interacting with our websites, using our mobile applications, opening our communications or engaging with our advertisements.
While our solutions are generally not targeted at individuals buying or selling for personal, family or household purposes, individuals do engage with certain of our solutions from time to time for these purposes.
Some information we obtain from you may be more sensitive in nature depending on the services you are engaging us to perform.  For instance, we may require ID numbers from a driver’s license or other identity documentation to process transactions or facilitate the extension of financing to your business.
Certain of our solutions obtain and store personal information for the benefit of our corporate or government customers to provide those customers specific technology services.  In those circumstances, we are acting as a service provider and collect and process that information in accordance with our customers written instructions and our contractual arrangement.
Offering you the choice of multiple solutions for different needs means that each solution operates somewhat differently.  To learn more about the categories of information handled by specific solutions and their sources, read on.

If you are an RBAS customer, your end users need to understand how you (and we) collect and process their personal information.  Accordingly, if you use a custom webshop or mobile app, you agree to post an up-to-date and accurate privacy notice on those tools that complies with the laws applicable to your business.  You also agree to obtain consent from your end users for the use and access of their personal information by us and other third parties.

If you are a representative of our corporate or government customer subscribing for services, we collect your business contact information to establish and maintain our relationship with our customer as their service provider (e.g. customer service and invoicing).
We also collect IMS end user credentials and interactions with the IMS to monitor, log, analyze and test the security of the systems, networks, databases and applications supporting the IMS and to ensure compliance by the customer with our contractual arrangements.  We also use this interaction data to monitor and improve the general performance and usability of the IMS such as enhanced features, GUI layouts, and page responsiveness.
Information and data collected by us through management of RBAS tools will be used as necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.

Data disclosure to OEMs and their dealers
As noted above, if you make a bid during a Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers or an IronPlanet sales event, we may disclose your bid and contact information with the OEM of the lot you bid on and any of the OEM’s dealers or representatives in your geographic area, if the OEM or dealer/representative entered into a contractual arrangement with us. We do not trade this information in exchange for money. OEMs and their dealers or representatives use this information to pursue their legitimate interest of understanding the lifecycle of their equipment and the secondary market for their equipment, to communicate with you about their products and services, and for other purposes disclosed in their privacy policies. Once disclosed, this information will be governed by the OEM’s or the OEM dealer’s privacy policy and will be subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the OEM or OEM dealer processes the information. See “
Privacy related requests and your preferences
” below on how to opt-out of this disclosure and how to request which OEMs and dealers your information was disclosed to during the 12-month period preceding the date of your request. For more information, visit our “
Data Use and Disclosure FAQ
“.
4.3
Data usage between RB Global corporate family members
In pursuit of our common interests we permit access to personal information among members of the RB Global corporate family for purposes consistent with this Privacy Notice. Where permitted by law, you may receive promotional and other communications from these related family members. See our “
Data Use and Disclosure FAQ
” for more information. To the extent that RB Global corporate family members have access to your personal information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
4.4
Automated decision-making
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers and IronPlanet use automated decision-making technologies to assist in determining a user’s bidding privileges and whether a deposit is required prior to bidding. This processing assists us in protecting our interests and the integrity of our auctions and efficiently make decisions to extend to you the contractual right to bid at an auction. Our decision on bidding privileges or a deposit may be reviewed by a Customer Care agent.
5. International transfer
Data the organization collects is transferred to database servers located in various regions, including Canada, European member states, Serbia and the United States. In addition, our personnel and our third-party service providers to whom your information is transferred for business purposes may also store and access (and in the case of service providers, onward transfer to) your personal information in other countries. These countries may offer a different level of data protection and may have different data protection rules than your country of residence. In certain circumstances courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other foreign jurisdictions may be entitled to access your information.
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK equivalent, information about individuals who are entitled to protection under those laws may only be transferred from their region to other regions if certain requirements are met. When we transfer your personal information from outside the EEA or UK, we rely on a variety of measures to support the transfer under applicable law.
As the European Commission and UK government consider Canada to be a country which provides adequate data protection, information may be transferred from the EEA or UK to Canada without additional measures. Certain of RB Global’s US operating companies also comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF”) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”, and together with the EU-U.S. DPF and UK Extension, the “Principles”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of all non-human resources personal data (as defined in the Principles) that is transferred from the European Union (“EU”), the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”) and Switzerland to the United States within the scope of the certification. The US operating companies have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that they adhere to the Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy notice and the Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) program, and to view our certification, please visit the
Data Privacy Framework site
.
The following US members of the RB Global group adhere to the Principles and are covered by the certification: Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (America) Inc., IronPlanet, Inc., and Ritchie Bros. Asset Solutions Inc., Rouse Services LLC, Rouse Appraisals, LLC, Rouse Analytics, LLC, Rouse Sales, LLC, SmartEquip Inc, Xcira LLC, Insurance Auto Auctions of Georgia LLC, Insurance Auto Auctions Tennessee LLC, Auto Disposal Systems Inc. Decision Dynamics LLC, Impact Texas LLC, Automotive Recovery Services, Inc., Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., and Insurance Auto Auctions Corp. For more information about the privacy practices of the Rouse, SmartEquip, Xcira, Insurance Auto Auctions and DDI Technology businesses, see their respective privacy notices linked in paragraph 1 above.
In cases where we transfer or disclose (or onward transfer) to third parties we may rely on a service provider’s certification to the Principles (if sent to the US) and/or contractual means to require administrative and technological safeguards designed to mitigate the threat of unauthorized access, use or disclosure of your information (such as standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission). We will remain liable under the Principles for any failure by a third party to comply with the Principles or our contractual arrangement with them unless, where permitted by applicable law, we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
For information on how to exercise your privacy rights under the Principles, see “
Privacy related requests and your preferences
” below.
Please contact us if you have any questions about the transmission of information among members of the Ritchie Bros. corporate family or our transfers to service providers as specified in “Who to contact with questions or for more information”. We have designated JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider which has locations in the United States, EU, the UK and Switzerland, to address unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the Principles. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit JAMS by clicking
here
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
Under certain conditions, a binding arbitration option may be available to you in order to address complaints not resolved by any other means. For further information, please visit the DPF site by clicking
here
. Our US operations are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with respect to all matters associated with the Principles.
6. Storage and erasure
We and our service providers store personal information in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice or for which you are otherwise notified. We will destroy or obfuscate data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy unless we are obliged to keep your personal data longer (i.e. for legal or audit purposes). In general, RB Global’s retention periods are 7 years. Permanent deletion of data can be difficult due to the impact on applications and systems. Where legally permissible, we may restrict further access or usage of data instead of deleting it.
Retention periods vary by region, the service or product in question and applicable law. We consider the following factors:
Is the information necessary to provide the service or product?
This covers things such as entering into a contract with you, performing the service requested or paid for, or maintaining appropriate business and financial records.
Is the information sensitive in nature?
What statutory, contractual or similar obligations exist?
This covers things such as retaining information as a result of contractual obligations or due to anticipated or pending legal disputes. Certain laws also stipulate required retention periods for certain information.
What will the impact on the integrity of systems and applications be if the information is removed?
7. Data security
While we take reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures designed to protect the information you submit or that we collect online and offline against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No Internet, email or mobile application transmission is ever fully secure or error free, nor are firewalls and physical access restrictions impenetrable.

California Residents.

State Privacy Disclosures
page for specific information on
Your California Privacy Rights
.
Access to Information.
In some jurisdictions, applicable law provides the right to be informed of and request access to the personal information we hold and process about you. For instance, for individuals with rights under the GDPR (and where appropriate, subject to our adherence to the Principles) , you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal information concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal information have been or will be disclosed, the envisaged period for which the personal information will be stored, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal information or restriction of processing of personal information or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal information’s source (where not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details. Access to information may be subject to certain exemptions.
Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Data.
You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you. For certain services, you may also use your online account profile page to review and edit some of your personal information.
Data Portability.
For individuals with rights under the GDPR, you may request personal information about you, that you provided to us, be delivered to you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).
Erasure.
You can request that we erase your personal information and deactivate your applicable user account. Please note that exemptions and restrictions may apply depending on applicable law. In some cases, we will not erase the data, but instead restrict further processing (e.g. where the information is still necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or is needed to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim). We may also obfuscate/pseudonymize or aggregate data where permitted.
Withdrawing Consent.
Where you have provided your consent to our processing of your personal information you may withdraw your consent at any time. Please specify if the request is a general withdrawal or which specific consent you want to withdraw. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.
Restricting Processing.
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to restrict the ways in which we use your personal information. For instance, under the GDPR, where:
you contest the accuracy of your personal information;
the processing is unlawful but you oppose the erasure of your personal information;
we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
you have objected to the processing based on the grounds described in the next paragraph below and pending the verification whether we have legitimate grounds which override your own.
Objecting to Processing.
The GDPR entitles individuals to object to our processing their personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on our legitimate interest. If an individual entitled to do so objects to such processing we will no longer process their personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If personal information is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, individuals have the right to object at any time to the processing of their personal information for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
Lodging Complaints.
You have the right to lodge complaints about the personal information processing activities we carry out before competent supervisory authorities. We hope though that if you reach out to us first, we can resolve your complaint amicably. If not, then refer to the chart below under “
Data Controllers
” to see which supervisory authority to contact.
Email Communications.
We use your email address to communicate with you in order to fulfill any contractual obligations with you (e.g. to send you invoices or settlement statements) and to notify you about important account information (e.g. updates to our terms of use or security notices). These communications are mandatory. Where permitted by applicable law, we may send you relevant marketing communications if you have registered and created a profile through one of our websites (including rbauction.com, ironplanet.com, truckplanet.com, or govplanet.com) and agreed to our terms of use for your profile. We may also send you marketing communications if you have contracted to sell with us or registered to bid in person at any of our live sales events and agreed to our terms at the time of registration. In certain jurisdictions, by doing so, you infer or imply your consent. If you reside in a country that requires that we obtain your express consent, we will ask for you to expressly opt-into communications. Marketing communications may come from the RB Global entity that you contracted with when creating a profile or registering to sell or bid, or from another member of the RB Global corporate family that provides products or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you are receiving marketing emails, you can unsubscribe from these marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you receive.
Data disclosure to OEMs and their dealers.
We provide you with the right to know what identifiable information and which OEMs and dealers and representatives we have disclosed information to for their use during the 12-month period preceding the date of your request. Depending on where you live, you may have the right to request data for a greater period of time. To obtain a list of these OEMs, OEM dealers or representatives who we have disclosed your identifiable information to and/or to stop any further disclosure, use the
privacy contact form
or other options noted above at the beginning of this section.

Cookies & similar technologies and your preferences
When you interact with our online offerings and digital content (e.g. emails or banner ads) or mobile apps, we, our service providers and selected third parties may use cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons and mobile identifiers) to make our offerings, content and apps better, faster and safer, to personalize our advertising across the web, to provide users a personalized experience or to measure the effectiveness of our efforts.
Cookies are small text files that are automatically created by your browser and stored on your device when triggered by the online offering or mobile app. Web beacons operate in conjunction with cookies as a small imperceptible graphic image that tracks a user action when taken (e.g. clicking on a link in an email). Other scripts and code snippets load and operate when visiting our websites or using our apps which transmit data about your device and usage of the relevant website or application.
Our use of these technologies falls into three categories:
Category
Description

Advertising related
Understand your interests and deliver personalized ad experiences, advertising content across the web, or emails based on usage patterns and behavior online (a.k.a. re-marketing or re-targeting)
Some of these technologies may be permanently placed on your device until you remove them (persistent cookies) while others are temporary and are removed after you close your browser (session cookies).
Our service providers use of your data on our behalf is subject to contractual arrangements between us and them. When you take certain actions, or engage with advertisements of our services, on other websites across the internet, selected third-party organizations place and use cookies and similar technologies to collect data about your activities.

The processing of your data by these third parties is subject to their privacy practices over which we have no control.
You may click the button below to access our Cookie Consent Manager tool. It is a browser cookie-based tool that allows you to modify settings related to certain Functional or Advertising cookies and related technologies. It is not possible to modify settings to Operationally Required cookies and related technologies. The tool works by communicating the selected setting to third party companies to initiate a third party’s opt-in/opt-out mechanism, if available. The effect of such selection may be described in the third party’s cookie and/or privacy statements. If the tool is unable to integrate with a third party this will be noted in the Detailed Settings description within the tool with information about such third party. The Detailed Settings descriptions will also provide information about the cookies and other technology we use.
The tool only works on the Internet browser you use to make your choice and it will only function properly if your browser is set to accept third-party browser cookies. If you delete cookies, change browsers, computers or operating systems, you will need to make a new selection.
You are always free to completely block cookies if your browser or device permits, although doing so will interfere with your use of some of our websites’ features or content. Review your browser settings to do so.

11. Other information regarding privacy
11.1 Responsibilities for receipt of information through services
When using our solutions, you may receive or have access to another person’s information. For example:
While we do not identify sellers and buyers on the IronPlanet marketplaces, certain sellers may offer inspection privileges in which case bidders will have access to name, address and contact information of an equipment manager to arrange for inspection
Once a buyer pays for items on the IronPlanet marketplace, they will receive information about the seller (name, address, contact information) to facilitate the pick-up of their purchases
Sellers advertising on the public Ritchie List and Mascus listings sites receive the contact information of interested buyers when an inquiry is made through the contact functionality
Interested buyers have access to the name and contact information of a seller advertising an item in a listing on the public Ritchie List and Mascus listing sites
You may use the information received or which you’ve been given access only to interact with the other person as part of your transaction or to comply with regulatory obligations. You must comply with all applicable law and, in particular, provide the other person with any data subject rights to which they are entitled. You are solely responsible for determining whether you may lawfully use the information received or accessed for other purposes. Note that certain information may also be subject to usage restrictions in accordance with our terms of use or buyer terms and conditions.
11.2 Providing us with third party personal information
If you provide us with personal information relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of the person or the disclosure of the information to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
11.3 Children's privacy
Our solutions are not intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect information from users or participants who are considered children under applicable laws. To participate in an auction or use our services, you must be 18 or older.
11.4
Logging in to IronPlanet's online marketplaces using your Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers web account
We permit you to use your Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers online web account credentials to log in to IronPlanet’s online marketplaces. To facilitate this cross-solution authentication, when you register an account with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers, we automatically create a dormant account for you on IronPlanet that becomes active only when you first sign-in.
11.5 Logging in to a preferred provider's site using Ritchie Bros. credentials
We permit certain of our preferred partners to authenticate your online access to their website or webservices using your IronPlanet or Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers online credentials. If you choose to do so, when logging-in you will be redirected to our website to enter your credentials. Once you successfully login, you will be redirected again back to the partner’s site. Your personal information collected by the partner when using their site will be handled by them for the purposes they disclose to you (such as in their privacy notices).
11.6 Links and Social Media Presences
Our websites contain links to other sites including sites maintained by our customers, third party service providers or preferred or recommended providers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy notices of all websites they choose to visit that collect personal information.
RB Global maintains publicly accessible profiles in various social networks listed below. Our social media presence ensures an internet presence that is as comprehensive as possible – which supports our legitimate commercial and marketing interests.
Social networks are able to analyze your user behaviour when you visit their websites or other sites with integrated social media plug-ins, or you use their mobile apps. When you’re logged-in to your social media account and you visit our social media presence, or you click on a hyperlink to our social media presence and then log-in to your account, the social media operator associates your visit with your social media user account. It may also be possible for the operator to identify you when you are not logged-in or do not have an account. All of this is made possible by the placement of tracking tools on your browser or device that are associated with the social media operator. These allow the operator to receive information from our websites which it combines with information it receives elsewhere on the internet or from other sources.
Social media operators use the information gathered about you to create user profiles that store your preferences and interests. The profiles are used to tailor advertising to you based on your interests both within and outside of their respective social media sites and across any device you’ve used to access the social media site. The information is also used by operators to provide anonymous measurement statistics and demographic data to us as administrators of our social media presence. We use this data to create content more relevant to our target audiences. For details of other uses of this data by operators, please refer to their respective privacy notices. For further information about our collection of data using cookies, web beacons and similar tools when you interact with our digital services, check out “
Cookies & similar technologies and your preferences
“.
For individuals with rights under the GDPR, when you visit one our social media presences, we are jointly responsible as controllers together with the social media operator for the data processing activities triggered by your visit. You may assert your rights against either of us, but please note, despite having joint responsibility we have no real influence over the data processing activities conducted by the social media operator. Refer to the information below for the specifics of each social media operator.

State Privacy Disclosures
Effective as of February 27, 2020.
1. California and Delaware “Do Not Track” Disclosure
California and Delaware law require Ritchie Bros. to indicate whether it honors “Do Not Track” settings in your browser. Ritchie Bros. does not monitor or respond to Do Not Track browser requests because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring them. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
2. California Civil Code §1798.83 (“Shine the Light” Law)
While Ritchie Bros.’ solutions are generally not targeted at individuals buying or selling for personal, family or household purposes, individuals do engage with certain of our solutions from time to time for these purposes. Ritchie Bros. provides California residents who engage with our solutions in California for these purposes the right to request once per calendar year a list (names and addresses) of those third parties who we disclosed personal information to during the preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes along with the categories of personal information provided. The information provided will be general in nature; not associated with the specific individual making the request. To exercise this right, use our dedicated
privacy contact form
. If specific information is desired, consider exercising available rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act described below.
3. California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)
This notice describes the rights of California consumers under the CCPA. We fully describe our practices in our
Privacy Statement
but use this separate notice to meet the CCPA’s requirements.
Sections 3A, 3B and 3C detail how we collect, share or “sell” (as defined by the CCPA) personal information of California consumers. Section 3D describes the rights of California consumers under CCPA and how to exercise them.
A. Collection of personal information
The following table identifies the personal information categories set out in the CCPA that we collect, the corresponding category of personal information referenced in the
Privacy Statement
and the information sources:

B. Purposes of collection and sharing of personal information
To understand the purposes for which we collect the personal information above and the categories of recipients with whom we share the personal information above, please review Section 4 of the
Privacy Statement
. You can use the category references from our Privacy Statement described above to identify the applicable purposes and recipients.
C. “Selling” of personal information
Ritchie Bros. does not sell personal information for money; however, the CCPA’s new definition of “sale” expands upon the common notion of a sale to include other forms of sharing practices that generate value other than money. Ritchie Bros. has entered into, and may in the future enter, into contractual arrangements with certain original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their dealers to disclose to OEMs and their dealers or representatives in your geographic region certain bid and contact information when you bid on or buy their equipment at a Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers or IronPlanet sales event.
The categories of personal information we disclose are:

for more information about this disclosure.
D. Your rights under the CCPA
(a) Right to know/access.
California consumers have the right to request we disclose the personal information we collect, use, disclose and sell during the 12-month period preceding the date of the request. This includes the right to request the categories of personal information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of personal information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about the consumer.
We will try to respond in 45 days but will let you know if we need more time. We are not obligated to respond more than two times in a 12-month period.
(b) Right to deletion.
Subject to certain exceptions, California consumers have the right to request the deletion of the personal information we have collected from the consumer. We will try to respond in 45 days but will let you know if we need more time.
(c) Right to opt-out.
California consumers have the right to opt-out of the future “sale” of their personal information. As explained above, for Ritchie Bros., this applies to the disclosure of bidder and buyer information from a Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers or IronPlanet sales event to OEMs and their dealers and representatives where certain contractual arrangements have been made. You may request we exclude your personal information from such disclosure arrangements using one of the means identified below.
(d) Right to non-discrimination.
A business may not discriminate against a California consumer because the consumer exercised any of their rights under the CCPA. We will only use the fact that you have exercised or requested to exercise any CCPA rights to facilitate a response to your request and to keep (and where required, report on) aggregated statistics on the number and types of requests we receive.
(e) How to exercise your rights.
California consumers may exercise their right to know/access, right to deletion and right to opt-out by any of the means below:
Completing our designated online
privacy contact form
Sending written correspondence to Ritchie Bros., Attn: Data Privacy Office, 9500 Glenlyon Parkway, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, V5J0C6
Calling our USA customer care team at 1.800.211.3983
In addition, for those seeking to opt-out of the future disclosure of information to OEMs and their dealers and representatives, you may email us @
OEMoptout@rbauction.com
.
(f) Request Verification.
For a request to know/access or request to delete, the consumer will be required to verify their identity before we take further steps to process their request. This could involve answering challenge questions or providing proof of identity and/or proof of address to us such as partial copies of a driver’s license or utility bill. If you are an authorized representative making this request on the consumer’s behalf, you will also need to provide proof of authorization, such as a copy of the power of attorney. Once verified, we will process the request.
We are obligated to verify the identity of those we release personal information to. If you do not cooperate with our efforts to verify the request, we will not be able to process the request.
Please note that the report satisfying a request to know will only be sent to the email address of the consumer associated with their registered Ritchie Bros. account. We will use secure means to send the report. Instructions on how to access it will be provided.
When requesting the closure of your Ritchie Bros. account, prior to taking such action, we will contact the account holder again for final confirmation.

X Privacy Policy
Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:

When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account.

Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.
3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether
videos you upload
are downloadable by others.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates
and third-party partners and
service providers
located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.
X is a
participant
in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us
here
. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body
JAMS
, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in
Annex 1
to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Content and data on some of our Services is viewable to non-Members (“Visitors”).
We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland. Members and Visitors located in the Designated Countries or the UK can review additional information in our
European Regional Privacy Notice

This Privacy Policy, including our Cookie Policy applies to your use of our Services.
This Privacy Policy applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-branded sites, apps, communications and services offered by LinkedIn (“Services”), including off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins, but excluding services that state that they are offered under a different privacy policy.

Data Controllers and Contracting Parties
If you are in the “Designated Countries”, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (“LinkedIn Ireland”) will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.

1. Data We Collect
1.1 Data You Provide To Us
You provide data to create an account with us.
Registration
To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.
You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services).
Profile
You have
choices
about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo,
city or area
, endorsements, and optional
verifications
of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include
sensitive information
on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.
You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar.
Posting and Uploading
We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services.
If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.
You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services.
1.2 Data From Others
Others may post or write about you.
Content and News
You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of
mentions in the news
.
Others may sync their calendar with our Services
Contact and Calendar Information
We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles.
Customers and partners may provide data to us.
Partners
We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.

Cookie Policy
, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.
Learn more
. You can
opt out
from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors,
the controls are

We receive data through cookies and similar technologies
When you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.
1.6 Communications
If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that.
We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use
automated systems
to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or
Professional Community Policies
.
1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information
When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.
Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “
LinkedIn Page
” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.
1.8 Sites and Services of Others
We get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account.
We receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies.
1.9 Other
We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.
Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.
Affiliates
Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation.
2. How We Use Your Data
We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.
How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your
settings
. We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. You can review LinkedIn's Responsible AI principles
here
and learn more about our approach to generative AI
here
.
Learn more
about the inferences we may make, including as to
your age and gender
and how we use them.
2.1 Services
Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
Stay Connected
Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their
settings
, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can
choose
whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
Visitors have
choices
about how we use their data.
Stay Informed
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were
mentioned in the news
.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
interested
in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your
settings
allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.
Learn more
.
2.2 Premium Services
Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you
opt-out
. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include
TeamLink
and
LinkedIn Pages
(e.g., content analytics and followers).
2.3 Communications
We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication
preferences
at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.

invitations
,
InMail
,
groups
and
messages
between connections.
2.4 Advertising
We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn
tag
on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,
groups
participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising
partners
, vendors and
publishers
; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).
Learn more
about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
Learn more
about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our
European Regional Privacy Notice
.
We will show you ads called
sponsored content
which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
Ad Choices
You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings
can be found here
. For Visitors,
the setting is here
.
Info to Ad Providers
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
2.5 Marketing
We promote our Services to you and others.
In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
2.6 Developing Services and Research
We develop our Services and conduct research
Service Development
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct
research
and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
Other Research
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these
jobs
and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under
controls
that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to
researchers
to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
Surveys
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may
opt-out
of survey invitations.
2.7 Customer Support
We use data to help you and fix problems.
We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
We use your
data
to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your
settings
, for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a
post
or LinkedIn
Page
, to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
2.9 Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our
User Agreement
and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
Social Action
E.g. like, comment, follow, share
Partners
Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services
Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
Profile
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a
group
, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your
settings
.
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your
settings
where applicable.
Subject to your
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you
choices
about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
Enterprise Accounts
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
Subject to your
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
3.2 Communication Archival
Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
3.3 Others’ Services
You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
Subject to your
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may
revoke
the link with such accounts.
The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages)
may be available to them on other services
. For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your
settings
), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
3.4 Related Services
We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services.
Where allowed
, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
3.5 Service Providers
We may use others to help us with our Services.
We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
3.6 Legal Disclosures
We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our
Data Request Guidelines
and
Transparency Report
.
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
4. Your Choices & Obligations

Ads and your data
Our goal is to help businesses reach the people they care about in a creative and meaningful way, while also giving our community control over what information is shared. You can manage how certain data affects the ads you see through the privacy settings of your TikTok app or your device.
We recognise that digital advertising can be complex, but we don’t think it has to be. We strive to communicate our ads practices simply and directly.
Respecting privacy in advertising
We build privacy into TikTok by design so that our community can confidently discover, create, and enjoy diverse and entertaining content. We work toward being transparent with our users about how we collect, use and share data for advertising.
About TikTok ads
Businesses show ads on TikTok to reach the people they care about in a creative and meaningful way. This helps keep TikTok free for our community to use.
You will see different kinds of ads when you use TikTok. All of the ads that TikTok is paid to place in user feeds or the search page are clearly marked with a "Sponsored" or "Ad" icon. You can interact with the ad very much in the same way as content posted by users. For example, you can share, like, comment on, or replay an ad if the advertiser enables these features for a particular ad; you can also report the ad if you find it inappropriate.
TikTok Ad Policies
determine the type of products and services that can be advertised on TikTok, in addition to the type of advertising content that is prohibited or restricted on our platform.
Reasons you may see certain TikTok ads
We want advertising to enhance your TikTok experience. To achieve that, TikTok shows you ads that use information you provide, that we automatically collect about you as you use TikTok, or that advertisers and measurement partners share about you.
You will receive
non-personalized ads
based on categories of information that are broadly applicable to you and other users based on the context, such as your country and language, and declared information, like your age. Non-personalized ads may be less relevant to you because these ads are not based on your past activity.
Depending on your ads settings, we may show you
personalized ads
, which are ads we think you will be interested in based on information we receive. This may include information about your activities on the app or on our advertising partners' websites and apps or in their stores.
Information we use for all ads
The following general information may be used to show you either personalized or non-personalized ads.
Location information:
For example, you may see an ad from an advertiser wanting to reach TikTok users in Berlin, Germany if we think you are in Berlin based on your location information.
Learn more
about how location information is collected.
Language information:
For example, you may see an ad from an advertiser wanting to reach Spanish speakers if your app language is set to Spanish.
Demographic information you provide:
For example, the age you provide when you sign up for a TikTok account can affect whether TikTok shows you an ad for a car rental service available to people aged 25 and over.
Information we use for personalized ads
The following additional information may be used to show you personalized ads, depending on your ad personalization choices.
Demographic information we infer:
For example, we may infer your gender based on your on-TikTok activity, which can be used to tailor the ads that you see. You can update inferred gender for ads at any time in your ads settings. Any updates apply only to your ads settings and do not affect other TikTok services.
Interest and Behavioral Information
On-TikTok activity:
TikTok may display ads about things you may be interested in, based on how you view, search, share and like content or interact with creator(s), as well as your previous interactions with similar ads. For example, a pet store might want to advertise a sale on dog toys to people interested in dogs; we might show this ad to users who liked a lot of videos tagged with the hashtag “dogs”. Or an outdoor activity store wants to advertise tents to followers of creators who post content about outdoor activities and nature. We will show this ad to followers of those types of creators.
Off-TikTok activity:
TikTok may personalise ads based on the information shared by our Advertisers, measurement and other partners. For example, a fashion brand may want to promote their summer clothing collection to customers who’ve purchased from their website or app in the past. The brand can share information with us so that we can show its ads to the TikTok users we think it’s trying to reach.
The shared information may include device information like your phone's advertising ID and/or email addresses and phone numbers that have been encrypted. Partners may also share the actions you take on the advertiser's app or website, like whether you placed an item in a shopping cart.
There are a few ways through which our partners share information with us:
Integration with TikTok advertiser tools (such as
TikTok Pixel, APIs
) through which TikTok can receive information about certain users' actions on the advertiser's website or app.
Uploading an audience file that contains device or encrypted contact information that TikTok can match to its users to create an audience for the advertiser to target.
Asking their measurement partners to send us data collected on behalf of the advertiser about their users' actions and events on the advertiser's website or app.
For more information about the types of data that can be used to serve ads, please see our
Privacy Policy
. Please note that TikTok uses information shared by Advertisers, measurement and other partners, only if they agree to comply with our terms protecting your privacy. You should review the applicable privacy policy for any websites and advertisers that you interact with.
Sharing data with measurement partners
We help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their ads on TikTok, such as whether a gaming app's ad resulted in more downloads of their app. To do this, we share information about your views or interactions with ads with our advertisers' measurement partners, which are companies that help advertisers understand how their ads achieved their marketing objectives. Measurement partners are not permitted to use or share such data for any other purposes. Advertisers also share your actions on their apps or websites or in their stores with these partners, who then determine whether these actions should be credited to an ad you saw on TikTok. This helps keep the advertising on TikTok relevant and keeps TikTok free for all users.
Controlling your ad experience
We provide products and information to help people understand how advertising on TikTok works – including what data is used to show you ads and who is paying for the ads you see.
About this ad
With the "About this ad" feature, you can find more information about how an ad was personalized using various targeting information selected by the advertiser, such as location information, age range, inferred gender information, inferred interests, and your behavioural information based both on your on and off-TikTok activity. For example, you may see an ad about dog toys if you have interacted with videos with hashtag "dogs" or visited a pet store website that has
TikTok Pixel
installed. You can click on the share button at the bottom right of the ad or long press on the ad video to find "About this ad".
About the advertiser
To provide you with more transparency about who paid for the ad that you have seen, we have included an "About the advertiser" disclosure within "About this ad." You will be able to see the advertiser's name, the person who paid for the ad if different from the advertiser (which, as applicable, may be translated into English), the name of the country where the advertiser registered with TikTok, and a control to mute the advertiser's ads for a period of time.
Your ad controls
To help enable you to control your advertising experience on TikTok, we offer a suite of tools within "Settings and privacy" to help you customize what personalized ads you see.
Within "Ads," you have the ability to manage how we use data to tailor ads to you. As described below, this setting may vary by region.
Mute an advertiser:
If you want to take a break from seeing ads shown by a particular advertiser, you can "mute" an advertiser from reaching you for 28 days in "Ads->Advertiser settings."
Clear your off-TikTok activity:
You can clear activity that advertising partners shared with TikTok about you that may have been used to show you ads in "Ads->Your Off-TikTok Activity" settings. You can clear your activity every 24 hours.
Update your ad interests:
You can view and adjust the interest targeting categories inferred by TikTok and used by advertisers to target ads to you in "Ads->How your ads are personalized."
Change language:
If you would like your ads to appear in a different language, you can change your app language setting in "Language."
Managing data usage for ads in different regions
EEA, UK and Switzerland
In the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, you can control the ads that you see in the following ways.
First, visit your TikTok app > Settings and privacy > Ads page.
Use your "Personalized ads" toggle to determine if your on- and off-TikTok activity data should be used to show you personalized ads. Using this setting, you can turn off personalized ads altogether. You’ll still see ads, but they may be less relevant to you.
For users on iOS 14.5 or later, you can go to your privacy settings and disallow TikTok from tracking your activity across other companies' apps and websites. When turned off, this iOS setting will take precedence over the in-app settings that you have chosen.
In Android, you can go to your privacy settings and choose to delete or reset the advertising ID, which is an identifier that can be used to track your activity across different apps.
Other Regions
Visit Your TikTok app > Account > Settings and privacy > Ads page to change whether the ads you see on TikTok can be more tailored to your interests based on data that advertising partners share with us about your activity on their apps and websites. You will always see ads based on what you do on TikTok.
In iOS, for version 14.5 or later, you can go to privacy settings and disallow TikTok from tracking your activity across other companies' apps and websites. When tracking is turned off, this iOS setting will have precedence over the in-app settings that you have chosen and the targeted advertising toggle described above will not be available. If you would like to enable targeted ads based on your off-TikTok activity, please turn on tracking for TikTok in your iOS device privacy settings.
In Android, you can go to your privacy settings and choose to delete or reset the advertising ID, which is an identifier that can be used to track your activity across different apps.
Can I block or report an ad?
Although you can't opt out of seeing all ads on TikTok, you can influence the types of ads that you see by providing feedback to TikTok about the ad or the advertiser.
Report an ad:
Click on Share icon at the bottom right of the ad > Choose Report > Follow on-screen instructions
