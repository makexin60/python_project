Information Your device provides passively about the device, the
			network it is on and the device's location.
Your use of AccuWeather Sites may result in the assignment of unique identifiers (IDs). Some of these IDs are generated by Your device and some of these are provided to Your device by Us or our Providers. These may be in the form or numbers or combinations of letters, numbers and other characters or other codes. These may be used to allow AccuWeather and its Providers and others who assist AccuWeather in the support of AccuWeather Sites to know Your device's location, web browsing movements or information about the environment near the device. When You use certain AccuWeather Sites, We allow You to choose when and how often to share Your device location data with Us and the purposes for which We or our Providers may use Your device location data. Basic AccuWeather app features will still function if You choose not to share Your device location data to receive personalized content and advertising.
When you use AccuWeather Sites, your device may send us some or all of the following:
GPS Coordinates
.
				The GPS coordinates of a device. On many devices, enabling or disabling “Location Services” (or a similar setting) controls whether the device sends GPS coordinates.
Internet Protocol (IP) Address
. An IP Address is a
				number automatically assigned by Your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
				The IP address is the host computer a device uses to connect to the
				ISP's network to send information to Us or to our Providers and for a
				device to receive information back from Us or from our Providers.
Device ID
. A Device ID is a combination of letters
				and numbers that is unique to the device You are using. The Device ID
				identifies the device, regardless of who is using the device. On many
				devices, the Device ID is provided by the device manufacturer and
				stored permanently in the memory of the device. Depending on how the
				manufacturer configured the device, You may not be able to change it.
Advertising ID (AAID) or ID for Advertising (IDFA)
.
				These are combinations of letters and numbers that are unique to the
				device You are using. However, these identifiers may not be permanent.
				Depending on Your device, You may be able to reset them through the
				settings of Your device or Your browser.
Information about the performance of Your device
.
				This may include information such as the operating system and version the device is using and the version of Our application the device is using.
Cookies
. Cookies are files with small amounts of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. If You are accessing an AccuWeather Site through a browser, including a browser on a mobile device, cookies may be sent to the browser and stored in the device's memory. This identifies the device the next time it accesses an AccuWeather Site through a browser. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if You do not permit the device to accept cookies, Your experience may not be optimal when You return to an AccuWeather Site because We may not recognize the device. We use both “session cookies” or “persistent cookies.” Session cookies are temporary and expire once You close Your browser or once Your session ends. Persistent cookies remain on Your device for much longer or until You or Your browser erase them. Persistent cookies have varying durations that are dependent on their expiration date. Cookies help Us improve the AccuWeather Site by providing Us with information about which parts of the AccuWeather Site are most popular, enabling Us to analyze technical and navigational information about the AccuWeather Site, and helping Us to detect and prevent fraud. We also use cookies and other data collection tools to help improve Your experience with the AccuWeather Site. These tools use cookies to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the AccuWeather Site (including IP address and geolocation) is transmitted to our data collection tool Providers. This information is then used by Us to evaluate visitors’ use of the AccuWeather Site and to compile statistical reports on website activity for Us. You can learn more about how We use cookies
here
.
Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, Flash Shared Objects/HTML5 Local
					Storage/HTML5 Mini Databases
. Many mobile devices use these technologies which allow for the
				storage of information on the mobile devices and, in effect, allow the
				enhancement of internet browsing. The Flash Shared Objects, HTML5 Local
				Storage and HTML5 Mini Databases also allow the device to track a
				user's web browsing movements across the internet and not just on one
				particular website. You can learn more about how we use these
				technologies
here
.
If you turn off "Location Services" or a similar setting that controls GPS functionality, the device still may automatically send or receive this other information as long as you have these other communications types enabled. You should read the instructions related to Your device, operating system or browser to learn about how to control the information Your device may transmit.
We do not respond to web browser Do Not Track signals at this time.

				upload or submit to Us.

Information Your device provides passively about the device, the
			network it is on and the device's location.
Your use of AccuWeather Sites may result in the assignment of unique identifiers (IDs). Some of these IDs are generated by Your device and some of these are provided to Your device by Us or our Providers. These may be in the form or numbers or combinations of letters, numbers and other characters or other codes. These may be used to allow AccuWeather and its Providers and others who assist AccuWeather in the support of AccuWeather Sites to know Your device's location, web browsing movements or information about the environment near the device.

When you use AccuWeather Sites, your device may send us some or all of the following:
GPS Coordinates
.
				The GPS coordinates of a device. On many devices, enabling or disabling “Location Services” (or a similar setting) controls whether the device sends GPS coordinates.
Internet Protocol (IP) Address
. An IP Address is a
				number automatically assigned by Your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
				The IP address is the host computer a device uses to connect to the
				ISP's network to send information to Us or to our Providers and for a
				device to receive information back from Us or from our Providers.
Device ID
. A Device ID is a combination of letters
				and numbers that is unique to the device You are using. The Device ID
				identifies the device, regardless of who is using the device. On many
				devices, the Device ID is provided by the device manufacturer and
				stored permanently in the memory of the device. Depending on how the
				manufacturer configured the device, You may not be able to change it.
Advertising ID (AAID) or ID for Advertising (IDFA)
.
				These are combinations of letters and numbers that are unique to the

We also use cookies and other data collection tools to help improve Your experience with the AccuWeather Site. These tools use cookies to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the AccuWeather Site (including IP address and geolocation) is transmitted to our data collection tool Providers.

Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, Flash Shared Objects/HTML5 Local
					Storage/HTML5 Mini Databases

				storage of information on the mobile devices and, in effect, allow the
				enhancement of internet browsing. The Flash Shared Objects, HTML5 Local
				Storage and HTML5 Mini Databases also allow the device to track a
				user's web browsing movements across the internet and not just on one
				particular website. You can learn more about how we use these
				technologies

Some of these IDs are generated by Your device and some of these are provided to Your device by Us or our Providers. These may be in the form or numbers or combinations of letters, numbers and other characters or other codes.

				The GPS coordinates of a device. On many devices, enabling or disabling “Location Services” (or a similar setting) controls whether the device sends GPS coordinates.
Internet Protocol (IP) Address
. An IP Address is a
				number automatically assigned by Your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
				The IP address is the host computer a device uses to connect to the
				ISP's network to send information to Us or to our Providers and for a
				device to receive information back from Us or from our Providers.
Device ID
. A Device ID is a combination of letters
				and numbers that is unique to the device You are using. The Device ID
				identifies the device, regardless of who is using the device. On many
				devices, the Device ID is provided by the device manufacturer and
				stored permanently in the memory of the device. Depending on how the
				manufacturer configured the device, You may not be able to change it.
Advertising ID (AAID) or ID for Advertising (IDFA)
.
				These are combinations of letters and numbers that are unique to the

However, if You do not permit the device to accept cookies, Your experience may not be optimal when You return to an AccuWeather Site because We may not recognize the device. We use both “session cookies” or “persistent cookies.” Session cookies are temporary and expire once You close Your browser or once Your session ends. Persistent cookies remain on Your device for much longer or until You or Your browser erase them. Persistent cookies have varying durations that are dependent on their expiration date. Cookies help Us improve the AccuWeather Site by providing Us with information about which parts of the AccuWeather Site are most popular, enabling Us to analyze technical and navigational information about the AccuWeather Site, and helping Us to detect and prevent fraud. We also use cookies and other data collection tools to help improve Your experience with the AccuWeather Site. These tools use cookies to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the AccuWeather Site (including IP address and geolocation) is transmitted to our data collection tool Providers.

Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, Flash Shared Objects/HTML5 Local
					Storage/HTML5 Mini Databases

				storage of information on the mobile devices and, in effect, allow the
				enhancement of internet browsing. The Flash Shared Objects, HTML5 Local
				Storage and HTML5 Mini Databases also allow the device to track a
				user's web browsing movements across the internet and not just on one
				particular website. You can learn more about how we use these
				technologies

AccuWeather Sites are not directed to children and AccuWeather does not intend to collect any PII from children. Please do not allow children under age 18 to use AccuWeather Sites, provide any PII to AccuWeather, or ask questions on AccuWeather Sites. If We are notified with verifiable information that a child under age 18 has provided PII to Us, We will delete that information as soon as reasonably possible. If You become aware that a child under age 18 has provided such information, please send Us a detailed email with all identifiable information at
customerservice@accuweather.com
so We may delete this information. We have no way to control the use of an access device that You allow a child under age 18 to use, and therefore the device may be sending Us information about the device's location and other factors. PLEASE EXERCISE CONTROL OF YOUR DEVICES TO PREVENT MINORS FROM GETTING INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEIR LOCATION MAY BE DISCLOSED TO US, OUR PROVIDERS, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES.
