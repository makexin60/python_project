Who does EnglishScore share data with?
We share data with:
Service Partners – third parties
who help us provide EnglishScore. We only share the minimum amount of information for them to do what we’ve asked them. We require them to look after your data properly;
Business Partners and/or Investors – companies and/or people who have a business relationship with us, or a financial interest in us. We only share data that is needed to help them understand EnglishScore’s business and finances; and
Academic Researchers – with people who study and analyse data, for example to check the quality and robustness of the tests we provide. The data we share with academic researchers is pseudonymised, which means we have replaced or removed information in a data set that identifies you as an individual – so the academic researchers are unable to identify you from the data we give them.
Our customers and/or partners only when you have consented to us doing this, we may share your name, email address, test results and the date you undertook the test with our customers and/or partners. If we do this we will ask you in the form of a consent box for each customer and/or partner that we intend to share your data with.
Other EnglishScore Users (Speaking and Writing Assessments only) — In order to receive a Speaking score, you consent to sharing your responses with other users for evaluation. Only your country location and your audio responses are shared. You will never be individually identified in this process
You can see our list of Third Parties (
https://www.englishscore.com/terms-third-parties
).
Some of these companies might be outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We always make sure that your data will be looked after, by having the right contracts with the companies or by checking if they are in an “adequate” country or are part of “Privacy Shield”. Please ask us if you need to know more.
If we choose to sell, transfer or merge (join) parts of our business, or if we choose to buy other businesses, the new owners will be able to use your data in the same way we have described in this privacy policy.
How does EnglishScore look after your data?
We use technical and organisational ways to keep your data safe. For example, we use encryption and security to help store the data. People who work for EnglishScore only have access to data they need to do their job, and important documents are protected by passwords.
If there is a data security breach (for example, if the wrong person has access to your data) and the law says we have to, then we will tell you and the appropriate regulator about what happened. A regulator is a company or organisation that the government has chosen to check that companies do the right things.
How long does EnglishScore keep your data?
We keep your data as long as we need to for our permitted purposes or to comply with the law. Any data not needed for our permitted processes is routinely deleted or anonymised (which means we remove information that identifies you).
What rights do I have?
You have control of your data, and you can ask us to do things with it. We must do what you ask or tell you why we can’t.
Here are some things you can ask us for:
a copy of the data we have about you;

to delete the data we have about you;
ask us not to use your data for some purposes;
