1. Introduction
Link Premium is a subscription membership that unlocks exclusive features and improved functionality. By purchasing Link Premium, you agree that you are authorizing recurring monthly or yearly payments, which will be made to Link using the payment method you selected until the subscription is canceled by you or Link. Link uses third-party payment processors to securely facilitate purchases of Link Premium.
1.1. Payment
You can manage your Link Premium subscription by accessing the Link Premium section in the Settings of your Link account. If your payment method is declined, you must provide new payment information or your Link Premium subscription will be canceled.
1.2. Taxes and Conversion Rates
Users in certain regions may be required to pay local taxes, which will be calculated and added to the total cost of a purchase. Payment providers may apply their own commissions and conversion rates to payments in various currencies. This is outside of Link’s control.
2. Business Account Policies
2.1. Post Quality Requirements
Here is an example of a product listing rule for your social network:
1. Product Design:
Product photos must be high-quality and clear, without blurry or fuzzy images.
Product photos must accurately reflect the actual product that will be shipped to the buyer.
Product images must not exceed the frames set by the image posting system.
It is prohibited to post photos with watermarks, logos of other companies or contact information.
2. Product Description:
The description must be detailed and accurately match the product characteristics.
Indicate the actual size, color, material and other important parameters.
Using false or misleading information about the product is strictly prohibited.
3. Categorization:
Each product must be placed in the appropriate category.
Sellers are required to choose the right tags and categories to make it easier for buyers to find the product.
4. Prohibited Goods:
Posting goods prohibited for sale by the laws of the country in which the social network operates is prohibited.
Selling counterfeit, uncertified and unsafe goods for consumers is prohibited.
5. Return and Warranty Conditions:
The product description must indicate the return and warranty conditions, if any.
The seller is obliged to provide current contact information for communication in case of questions or the need for a return.
6. Pricing:
The indicated price of the product must be accurate, taking into account all applicable taxes and fees.
Posting deliberately low prices in order to attract attention is prohibited if such a price does not correspond to the actual cost of the product.
Compliance with these rules is necessary to ensure fair and high-quality trading on the social network. Violation of the rules may lead to the removal of the product and blocking of the account.
2.2. Restrictions for Regular Users
Regular users are not allowed to publish promotional product posts. If they attempt to do so, their account will be blocked for six hours, and they will receive a warning. The warning will inform the user that in order to publish promotional posts, they need to activate a business account. A button for quick activation of a business account will be provided in the warning. If the user purchases a business account while their account is blocked due to posting a promotional post, the block will be immediately lifted.
Post Guidelines: Correct and Incorrect Posts
In today's world of social media and online content, it's essential to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality posts. Your content is the face of your brand, and its proper presentation can significantly impact how your audience perceives you. Let's break down what makes a post correct or incorrect.
Incorrect Posts
* Inappropriate and meaningless: Posts that offer no value or meaning to your audience. They might be out of context, random, or simply irrelevant to your channel's theme.
* Unclear: If your posts are too complicated to understand or confusing, they won't resonate with your audience.
* Too much text, too little meaning: An excess of text without a clear idea or purpose can turn readers away.
* Low quality: This applies to both images and text. Poor design, blurry images, and lack of structure are all signs of a low-quality post.
* Non-original content: Copying others' ideas and texts without credit falls into the category of incorrect posts.
Correct Posts
* Beautiful and high-quality: Posts should be visually appealing and professionally designed.
* Meaning and value: Every post should carry a message or information that is interesting and useful to your audience.
* Clear: Clearly and simply expressed thoughts are key to a successful post.
* High-quality images and text: Good posts contain high-quality images that match your brand and style.
* Original content: Create original posts that reflect your uniqueness.
