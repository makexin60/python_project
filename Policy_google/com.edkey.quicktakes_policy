This information may include but is not limited to Personal Information, such as your user name, phone number, profile picture, school affiliation and location, billing and payment information, and other information in the course of providing Platform features or QuickTakes Products.
You may be able to log in to our site using third-party sign-in Platform such as Office 365 or Google. These Platforms authenticate your identity and provide you with the option to share certain personal information with us, including your name and email address, to pre-populate our account sign-up form. If you choose to enable a third party to share your third-party account credentials with QuickTakes, we may obtain additional information about you via that mechanism.
We do not require location-based information from your QuickTakes user account that would tell us where your mobile or other device is located on the globe at a particular time, though you have the option to provide us with such information. If you provide location-based information, you have the option to not display your school name, district, state or region, though the country that your mobile device is located would be displayed on the Platform.
B. Information Collected Automatically
When you interact with the Platform, QuickTakes automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, QuickTakes cookie information, and the page(s) you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Platform, and the number and frequency of visitors to our site and its components.

We also use third-party mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile App on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the Mobile App, the events that occur within the Mobile App, aggregated usage information, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer or mobile device to enable systems to recognize a computer or device and specify how and when pages in a site are visited and by how many people. QuickTakes cookies may collect Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information and combine the general information collected through these cookies with other Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information for various purposes, such as to allow for single-sign-on and to count the number of visitors to a QuickTakes page.
