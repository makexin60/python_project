number of personnel who need access to the information to perform their duties. Unfortunately, no
data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe
that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your
Account has been compromised), please contact us immediately.
We retain your Personal Information as long as you maintain an Account, and/or you utilize the
Application. We retain Personal Information after we cease providing services directly or indirectly to
you, even if you close your Account, or delete the Application, to the extent necessary to comply with
our legal and regulatory obligations, and for the purpose of fraud monitoring, detection and
prevention. We also retain Personal Information to comply with our tax, accounting, and financial
reporting obligations, where we are required to retain the data by our contractual commitments to our
financial partners, and where data retention is mandated by the payment methods that we support.
Where we retain data, we do so in accordance with any limitation periods and records retention
obligations that are imposed by applicable law.
8. International Data Transfers.
We are a global business. Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we
have operations or where we engage service providers. We may transfer Personal Information that we
maintain about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the Personal Information
was originally collected, including to the United States. Those countries may have data protection rules
that are different from those of your country. However, we will take measures to ensure that any such
transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your Personal Information remains
protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. In certain circumstances, courts, law
enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be
entitled to access your Personal Information.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (â€œEEAâ€), the UK or Switzerland, we comply with
applicable laws to provide an adequate level of data protection for the transfer of your Personal
Information to the US. By submitting your Personal Information, you agree to the transfer, storing or
