The Paramount Services covered by this privacy policy are generally not intended for use by children. Instead, our child-directed Paramount Services, including our policies around parental consent, are covered by our

. In channels available through our general audience Paramount Services, or in areas of those Paramount Services that are directed to children, we collect only a limited amount of personal information, as permitted by law. Specifically, we may collect IP addresses, device identifiers, certain unique ID numbers, and limited viewing information. We do not use (or allow our partners to use) this information, other than for the purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to provide children with access to features and activities on the services, to customize content and improve our services, to serve contextual advertising, or limit how often a particular advertisement is seen.

For example, we retain your registration information for the duration of your relationship with us. Once our relationship ends, we retain certain records (including your email address and details about your transactions) for an additional period of time to comply with our legal obligations in certain jurisdictions and to prevent fraud. If you submit a request to exercise one of your privacy rights, we retain records of those requests so that we can comply with them (for example, so that we remember your request to opt out of marketing messages) and so that we can demonstrate that we have complied. In each case, we determine how long to retain information based on how long it is needed to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, whether we need to retain it for an additional window to comply with record-keeping obligations or to defend against legal claims or prevent fraud.

Depending on where you reside, there are additional disclosures and certain additional rights regarding your personal information, as described below. The rights available to you will depend on the laws in the state where you live.
SHARING (FOR CROSS-CONTEXT BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING), SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND PROCESSING FOR PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING

For instance, some of our brands disclose certain device identifiers and advertising identifiers associated with your mobile or connected device to advertising partners. Those partners use and share those identifiers to show you advertisements that are targeted to your interests on third-party sites and services. We also receive information from third parties, which we use to help inform which ads to show you on the Paramount Services.
Where a brand does this or otherwise “sells” your personal information, we will give you the opportunity to opt out by clicking the “Your Privacy Choices” link on the footer of the relevant website, or in the settings menu of the relevant mobile or online application, or other service.
The following types of personal information may be processed for purposes of targeted advertising, and may have been “shared” or “sold” in the 12-month period prior to the last modified date of the privacy policy:

(e.g., agencies, publishers, and advertising networks)
Social media companies
Parties to a corporate transaction
(e.g., if we are involved in the purchase, sale, lease, or other acquisition of our systems containing personal information)
We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” personal information of individuals under the age of 16.
Do Not Track
. Our websites and apps are not designed to respond to “do not track” requests from browsers.
DEIDENTIFIED INFORMATION
To the extent we process deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information unless permitted by applicable law.
SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION
In the U.S., there may be instances where we process information that is considered “sensitive personal information”. We use sensitive personal information only when permitted by applicable laws – specifically, to provide you with the Paramount Services, to perform analytics on the Paramount Services, to serve you targeted advertising, and to comply with our legal obligations.

Interest-based advertising
We, our service providers, business partners, and other third parties may use interest-based advertising. This means that we may collect information about you on the Paramount Services and on Third-Party Services to help serve advertising relevant to your interests across your devices, browsers, and on and off the Paramount Services. For more information on the choices that may be available to you to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, please visit:
Digital Advertising Alliance (US)
Digital Advertising Alliance (Canada)
Digital Advertising Alliance (Australia)
Digital Advertising Alliance (EU)
Network Advertising Initiative
You can also opt out of interest-based advertising with some of the third-party partners we use, such as Google (
https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated
). Please note that if you opt out of interest-based advertising, some information will still be collected for other purposes, such as research, analytics, and internal operations. You will also continue to receive contextual advertisements, but they may be less relevant to your interests.
On many mobile devices, you can manage interest-based advertising through your device’s settings. These options can include resetting your device’s advertising ID or selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” (for Android devices) in your device settings.
Connected devices (such as tablets, connected TVs, set top boxes, streaming devices, and gaming consoles) may also use an advertising ID or other methods to identify you or serve you interest-based advertising. In some cases, you can disable tracking by selecting options like “limit ad tracking” or disabling options like “interest-based advertising” in your connected device’s settings. These options will vary by device, and we do not control the policies or practices of third parties providing these devices.
Please note that your choice to opt out is device- or browser-specific and you will need to manage your preferences for each device or browser you use. You may also need to make this choice separately on different Paramount services. For additional information on exercising your privacy rights, please see “
Your choices, rights, and controls
”.
For additional information about the rights that may be available to you if you live in the United States, including the right to opt out of “sale”, “sharing for cross-contextual behavioral advertising”, and processing for targeted advertising, please see “
Additional Information: US States
”.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Paramount is a global company that may transfer your personal information to a country (including the United States) that does not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. Paramount may transfer your personal information to the
Paramount family of companies
, carefully selected service providers, business partners, and other third parties for the purposes described in this policy.
Whenever we transfer your personal information within the Paramount family of companies and to our service providers, business partners, and other third parties, we look at the risks to your information and rely on safeguards, where applicable, to ensure your rights are protected. For instance, we have put in place standard contractual clauses approved under data protection laws in Argentina, the EEA, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to facilitate transfers to the United States.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The Paramount Services covered by this privacy policy are generally not intended for use by children. Instead, our child-directed Paramount Services, including our policies around parental consent, are covered by our
Children’s Privacy Policy
. In channels available through our general audience Paramount Services, or in areas of those Paramount Services that are directed to children, we collect only a limited amount of personal information, as permitted by law. Specifically, we may collect IP addresses, device identifiers, certain unique ID numbers, and limited viewing information. We do not use (or allow our partners to use) this information, other than for the purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to provide children with access to features and activities on the services, to customize content and improve our services, to serve contextual advertising, or limit how often a particular advertisement is seen.
RETENTION
We will retain your personal information for the time period reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes described in this privacy policy, or any other notice provided at the time of collection unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law.
We determine how long to retain information based on the purposes for which it was collected, its sensitivity, our legal obligations, and the purposes set out in this privacy policy. For example, we retain your registration information for the duration of your relationship with us. Once our relationship ends, we retain certain records (including your email address and details about your transactions) for an additional period of time to comply with our legal obligations in certain jurisdictions and to prevent fraud. If you submit a request to exercise one of your privacy rights, we retain records of those requests so that we can comply with them (for example, so that we remember your request to opt out of marketing messages) and so that we can demonstrate that we have complied. In each case, we determine how long to retain information based on how long it is needed to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, whether we need to retain it for an additional window to comply with record-keeping obligations or to defend against legal claims or prevent fraud.
COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
We may automatically receive certain information about you and your device using browser- or device-based tracking technologies described below. These technologies allow us to ensure the Paramount Services are functioning correctly, improve the Paramount Services, provide and measure advertisements, and provide personalized content to you.
You can manage how these tracking technologies are used by adjusting your device or browser settings and, in some countries, by selecting your preferences in a consent management solution. In some cases, you can opt out of tracking by our analytics providers by visiting their
opt-out pages directly

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION US STATES
Depending on where you reside, there are additional disclosures and certain additional rights regarding your personal information, as described below. The rights available to you will depend on the laws in the state where you live.
SHARING (FOR CROSS-CONTEXT BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING), SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND PROCESSING FOR PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING
Certain disclosures of information that we make to third parties or purposes for which we use information we receive from third parties constitute the “sale” of your personal information, “sharing” of your personal information (for “cross-context behavioral advertising” purposes), or “processing” of your personal information for purposes of “targeted advertising” under applicable laws. For instance, some of our brands disclose certain device identifiers and advertising identifiers associated with your mobile or connected device to advertising partners. Those partners use and share those identifiers to show you advertisements that are targeted to your interests on third-party sites and services. We also receive information from third parties, which we use to help inform which ads to show you on the Paramount Services.
Where a brand does this or otherwise “sells” your personal information, we will give you the opportunity to opt out by clicking the “Your Privacy Choices” link on the footer of the relevant website, or in the settings menu of the relevant mobile or online application, or other service.
The following types of personal information may be processed for purposes of targeted advertising, and may have been “shared” or “sold” in the 12-month period prior to the last modified date of the privacy policy:
Registration Information and Online Identifiers
: Names and aliases; email address; IP address; unique identifiers
Commercial information
: Information about transactions or content choices made on or in connection with the Paramount Services
Online Activities and Preferences
: Information related to your preferences, attitudes, online behaviors, demographics, product and ad choices, and preferences
Location data
: Information related to your location, including your IP address
Social Media Information
: Social media statuses and updates, pictures, and references to your online presence
Each category of personal information listed above is “shared” with or “sold” to the following third parties to help us target and deliver personalized ads to you on the Paramount Services and Third-Party Services as described in this policy:
Business partners
(e.g., marketing companies, sponsors working with us on co-branded promotions)
Advertisers and other advertising partners
(e.g., agencies, publishers, and advertising networks)
Social media companies
Parties to a corporate transaction
(e.g., if we are involved in the purchase, sale, lease, or other acquisition of our systems containing personal information)
We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” personal information of individuals under the age of 16.
Do Not Track
. Our websites and apps are not designed to respond to “do not track” requests from browsers.
DEIDENTIFIED INFORMATION
To the extent we process deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information unless permitted by applicable law.
SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION
In the U.S., there may be instances where we process information that is considered “sensitive personal information”. We use sensitive personal information only when permitted by applicable laws – specifically, to provide you with the Paramount Services, to perform analytics on the Paramount Services, to serve you targeted advertising, and to comply with our legal obligations.

Your Choices, Rights, and Controls
section of this Privacy Policy, you also have the following rights:
Opt out of Sale/Sharing/Targeted Advertising

These ads may be based on historical information or information “shared” or “sold” by other sources.

In those states where it is applicable, you or your authorized agent may submit a request to exercise any of the above rights by visiting our
Privacy Rights Center
or by calling us at (888) 841-3343. To opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, or our processing of your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising, click on the Your Privacy Choices link in the footer of the relevant websites or in the settings menu of the relevant mobile or online applications.

Our Mission to Protect Children's Privacy
We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections when it comes to children. Some of the Services are directed to children, while other Services or portions of them are intended for use by adults and teens.  For Services that are directed to children, we may collect, use, and disclose information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.  Some of this information may be considered “Personal Information” or “Personal Data” (as defined under applicable law) which is information that identifies you or your device or is reasonably associated with you.  We consider you to be a child if you are not of legal age to consent to the collection and processing of your Personal Information under applicable laws where you live.
Information We Collect
Below we summarize potential instances of collection of Personal Information where our Services are directed at children. We also outline how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consent.
In any instance that we collect Personal Information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity requested or allow you to continue to participate in the activity, and to ensure the security of our users and our Services, or as required by law.
In the event we discover we have collected Personal Information from or about a child in a manner inconsistent with legal requirements, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection.
The Personal Information that we collect generally falls within three broad categories: (a) information you provide to us, (b) information we collect automatically when you use or access our Services, and (c) information we obtain from other sources.
Information You Give to Us
You can use most of the Services without actively submitting any information, but some of the Services may allow you to provide Personal Information, such as the following:
Identifiers such as name, username, phone number, email address, and mailing address.
Profile information such as date of birth, gender, avatar, and interests.
Parent or guardian contact information.
We may also require payment information such as a credit card number.  We will ask you to get a parent or guardian to assist you with these transactions or for permission from your parent or guardian before allowing you to use a credit card number on one of our Services.
Information Collected About Your Computer, Phone and Other Devices
We and our service providers operating on our behalf or other businesses who collect information on our Services may automatically collect or receive certain information associated with you and/or your device(s) as part of your use of our Services through device-based tracking technologies.  This could be information such as your IP address (a number assigned by your Internet Service Provider that can identify your device), mobile advertising ID (a resettable identifier assigned to your device by  operating system provider, such as Apple or Google), media access control (MAC) address, and identifiers associated with cookies, pixels, tags, beacons, scripts or other technology.

Educational Services
Some of our Services are available for teachers, schools, and school districts (
“Schools”
) to use as part of an educational curriculum under the oversight of the School. These Services are designed to minimize the collection of Personal Information from children and to comply with student data privacy laws. When used by Schools, usernames, identifiers that may identify you or your device, and other information may be provided to us by a child’s School and associated with a class or grade level. The School will be able to see information regarding the child’s use of the Services in connection with a class and make changes to the child’s username and other information.  In some circumstances, teachers and other authorized personnel may create accounts for their students.
The School is solely responsible for providing notices and obtaining consents required by applicable student data privacy laws, including providing all required notices to parents, obtaining all necessary parent or guardian consents, or complying with applicable requirements of an exemption or exception from parental consent requirements. The School is also responsible for activities such as removing a child from class roster, deleting a class, or submitting a deletion request when a child’s Personal Information is no longer needed for School purposes.
If the Services are downloaded on a personal device, a parent or guardian may be able to view their child’s Personal Information (such as username and activities completed) by logging into the child’s class account. The parent can delete the application providing the Services from the child’s device, but the child’s Personal Information may continue to be associated with the School’s class account until the School deletes that Personal Information. If you are a parent and have questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting your child’s Personal Information, please contact your child’s School directly.

We will provide notice to you if these changes are material and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. Notice may be by email to you at the last email address you provided us, by posting notice of such changes on our websites, applications and Services, or by other means, consistent with applicable law.
