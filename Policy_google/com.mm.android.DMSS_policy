based on consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at
support@cce-soft.com.
A summary of your
legal rights is set out below

Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access
request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold
about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to
have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we
may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or
remove personal data by entering into
【
Account – Delete Account
】
where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also
have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have
successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we
may have processed your data unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
personal data to comply with local law. However, for specific legal reasons,
such as it is mandatory for us to retain your personal data as required by
laws, we may not be able to comply with your request of erasure but we will
notify you at the time of your request in such circumstance, if applicable.

Object to
processing
of your personal data where we are
relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and
freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate
that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your personal data which
override your rights and freedoms.

Request restriction
of processing
of your personal data. This
enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the
following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b)
where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c)
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need
it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to
our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
legitimate grounds to use it.

Request the
transfer
of your personal data to you or to
a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided
consent for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you.

Withdraw consent at
any time
where we are relying on consent to
process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your
consent, we may not be able to provide certain Apps or services to you. We will
advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
For security reasons, we will take steps to
authenticate your identity before providing access to your personal data. You
also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant Data Protection
Authority.
