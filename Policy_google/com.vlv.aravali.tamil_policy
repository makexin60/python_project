This  Piracy  Policy  (‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù)  is  to  set  forth  the  process  of  addressing  issues  related  to  copyright infringement faced by KUKU group apps and websites (‚ÄúWe‚Äù / ‚ÄúOur‚Äù / ‚ÄúUs‚Äù) with respect to information uploaded by Us as  well  as  third  party  users  (‚ÄúUser‚Äù  /  ‚ÄúYou‚Äù  /  ‚ÄúYour‚Äù)  on  the  KUKU group apps and website

Collection & Display
When  Content  (as  defined  below)  is  uploaded  onto  the  Apps  and/or  the  Websites  (hereinafter collectively referred to as ‚Äú
Platform
‚Äù), it undergoes a thorough screening by Us (‚Äú
Screening
‚Äù) wherein  the  Content  is  reviewed,  examined  and  filtered  based  on  certain  technical  and  legal parameters including but not limited to examining whether the Content is original and does not infringe upon any intellectual property right of any third party including trademark, copyright or other  proprietary  rights.  For  the  purpose  of  this  Policy,  ‚Äú

When  large  files  of  Content  are  uploaded  on  the  Platform,  they  are  broken  up  into  batches  of smaller files and then uploaded by Us in order to ensure that the Content is thoroughly Screened before being uploaded on the Platform and to minimise the possibility of piracy.
After  the  Screening,  the  Content  which  clears  the  Screening  (‚ÄúUndisputed  Content‚Äù)  is segregated from the Content which does not clear the Screening (‚Äú
Unapproved Content
‚Äù) and the  Content  which  has  not  been  Screened  yet  (‚ÄúUnreviewed  Content‚Äù).  The  Unapproved Content becomes inaccessible on the Platform.
Only Undisputed Content shall be displayed in the search results on the Platform when a search input for Content is provided by You.
Action taken for infringement
We will act in accordance with all applicable laws when We are made aware of any infringing activity on the Platform broadly laid down as below:
Policy Highlights
KUKU group apps and websites respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect you to do the same. Your account may be suspended or terminated for copyright violations or for violations of the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
We  will  work  towards  resolving  all  copyright  complaints  (‚ÄúComplaint‚Äù)  which  we  receive against Content copied on the Platform/an external medium and/or it is originally published on an  external  medium  and  subsequently  copied  on  the  Platform  of  an  Original  Owner  of  the Content.
The Complaint must be supported by clear and substantial proof of the copyright ownership and the specific instance of copyright infringement so as to enable Us to take the Complaint on record. In case of any shortcomings, We reserve the right to refuse to take any action in respect to the Complaint and/or seek additional documentation, at Our own discretion.
We  do  not  provide  legal  advice  to  the  complainant  if  they  decide  to  initiate  legal  proceedings against  the  defaulter.  The  complainant  must  seek  independent  legal  advice  under  such circumstances.
Categorization of infringement
I. Copying Content and publishing it on the Platform
Where  a  Complaint  is  received  by  Us,  reporting  that  certain  Content  is  infringing  (‚Äú

‚Äù)  an  original  Content  (‚Äú
Original  Content
‚Äù)  published  on  the  Platform  the  following process may be followed:
If  the  owner/authorized  agent  of  the  Original  Content  (‚ÄúOriginal  Owner‚Äù)  reports copyright infringement with respect to a Disputed Content, the Disputed Content shall be removed  within  36  (thirty-six)  hours  from  receipt  of  proof  of  copyright  infringement  of the Disputed Content.
We shall send a notice to the owner/authorized agent of the Disputed Content (‚ÄúDisputed Owner‚Äù) with information regarding the Complaint received.
If it is proven that the Content in the Complaint is Disputed Content, then We may, at Our sole discretion, take one or more of the following actions:
Permanently removing the Disputed Content.
Move  the  published  works  to  draft  status  where  the  Disputed  Owner  may  not  re-publish the same without Our permission.
Permanently  delete  the  Disputed  Content  from  the  Disputed  Owner‚Äôs  profile  where they may not re-publish the same thereafter.
If the Disputed Owner has been found to have published Disputed Content 3 (three) or more times, then We can, at our discretion and liberty, choose to:
i
Deactivate the User profile; and/or
ii
Block the User profile
If the Disputed Owner denies copying the Original Content, then the Disputed Owner will be  given  an  opportunity  to  convince  the  Original  Owner  that  he  has  not  infringed  the copyright of the Original Owner‚Äôs Content.
If the Disputed Owner refuses to do so, the Original Owner will have the option to initiate legal action against the Disputed Owner or they may waive their objection and allow the Disputed Content to be published.
We will block access to the Disputed Content for a period of twenty-one (21) days. The order of the competent court having jurisdiction must be submitted to Us within a period of twenty-one (21) days from the date of submitting the report of infringement. If no such order is submitted, then We will unblock the access to the Disputed Content. In such an event, the Original Owner can file another Complaint, which will undergo the same process as mentioned above.
Our internal detection system for copied material detects Disputed Content and the Content is found to be Disputed Content, then We may, at our sole discretion, forthwith remove such Content.
II. Copying External Content and publishing it on the Platform
Where a Complaint is received by Us, reporting that certain Content is infringing certain content published on an external platform (‚ÄúExternal Content‚Äù) the following process may be followed:
When the owner/authorized agent of the External Content reports copyright infringement of their works with respect to Content on the Platform and We are satisfied that the report is  factual,  then  We  will  block  access  to  the  Disputed  Content  for  twenty-one  (21)  days. The  order  of  the  competent  court  having  jurisdiction  must  be  submitted  to  Us  within  a period of twenty-one (21) days from the date of submitting the report of infringement. If no such order is submitted, then We will unblock the access to the Disputed Content. In such  an  event,  the  owner/authorized  agent  of  the  External  Content  can  file  another Complaint, which will undergo the same process as mentioned above.
II. Copying Content and publishing it on an external platform
If We are made aware, either by a third party or through Our detection system of any specific instances wherein Original Content published on the Platform is copied and made available on an external medium by any party, then the following process may be followed:
Our   detection   mechanism   will,   to   the   extent   practically   possible,   monitor   such infringement and will have the Original Content removed from the external medium as per the process enabled by such external medium.
When  we  are  made  aware  that  Original  Content  published  on  the  Platform  is  being downloaded and saved onto files and/or a third party is stream ripping the Original Content and publishing it on an external platform, then We shall report the same and shall ask for the external platform/website to be removed.
If the external platform fails to take action and/or fails to remove such infringing content from  the  external  platform,  then  We  may,  at  our  discretion  and  not  being  obligated  to, initiate legal proceedings against the external platform.
