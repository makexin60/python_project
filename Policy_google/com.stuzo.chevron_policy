Websites
: When you visit our websites, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, web server logs, session replay and screen capture technology, and other technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. The information we collect in this manner may include your device IP address, unique device identifier, web browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, clickstream data, and dates and times of website visits.
We also may use session replay and screen capture technology to collect, on a real-time basis, information on how you use and navigate the sites. This may include mouse movements, how you scroll through the sites, and certain keystroke information.
Mobile Apps:
When you use our mobile apps, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as through device logs, server logs and other technologies. The information we collect in this manner may include the device type used, the mobile operating system, device identifiers and similar unique identifiers, device settings and configurations, IP addresses, WiFi network identifiers and signals, battery and signal strength, usage statistics, referring emails and web addresses, dates and times of usage, actions taken on the mobile apps, and other information regarding use of the mobile apps. In addition, as indicated above, we may collect your device’s geolocation information with your consent which assists us with the security of the products and services and assists us with offering features like search results for fuel stations and stores, and messages based on your location. Please note that if you decline to allow the mobile apps to collect your fine or precise geolocation, you will not be able to use all of the mobile apps’ features or the offers available through the mobile apps.
We may use these automated technologies on our Sites to collect information about your equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns. These technologies help us (1) remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it; (2) track and understand how you use and interact with our Sites; (3) tailor the Sites around your preferences; (4) measure the usability of our Sites and the effectiveness of our communications; and (5) otherwise manage and enhance our products and services, and help ensure they are working properly.
Your browser may tell you how to be notified about certain types of automated collection technologies and how to restrict or disable them. Please note, however, that without these technologies, you may not be able to use all of the features of the Sites.
Restricting the Collection and Use of Google Analytics Data:

Google may use the data collected on the Sites to contextualize and personalize the ads delivered through its own advertising network. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by
Google’s Analytics Terms of Use
and
Privacy Policy
.  Google offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available

Interest-Based Advertising
On our Sites, we may obtain information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services that may be tailored to your interests. This section of our Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise certain choices.
You may see our ads on other websites because we use third-party ad services. Through these ad services, we can target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context. These services track your online activities over time and across multiple websites and apps by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other similar technologies. The ad services use this information to show you ads that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information that ad services may collect includes data about your visits to websites that serve Company advertisements, such as the pages or ads you view and the actions you take on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad services. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  The Sites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.
Opting Out of Ad Network Interest-Based Advertising: While Company does not deliver third party online advertisements on our Sites, we advertise our products and services on others' online services. Please familiarize yourself with those website operators' or network advertisers' privacy policies to understand their practices relating to advertising, including what type of information they may collect about your Internet usage.  Individuals may opt-out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI or EDAA member ad networks by using tools provided visiting the following sites:

In order to offer you a more consistent experience in interacting with Company, information collected by our mobile apps may be combined with information we collect by other means.
Sites improvement. We may use data about you to improve the Sites (including our security measures) and related products or services, or to make our Sites easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information, or by customizing the Sites to your particular preference or interests.

Disclosure of personal data
Company may share your personal data with its subsidiaries and affiliates and its joint ventures.  We also may share your personal data as described below.
Disclosure to service providers. Company contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting the Sites, sending out information, processing transactions, and analyzing the Sites. We provide these companies with only those elements of personal data they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using those personal data for any other purposes.
Disclosure in connection with transactions. In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of the personal data you provide to financial institutions, government entities and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfilling the transaction.  We also may disclose your personal data where you intend to interact with a third party or direct us to do so.
Disclosures in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Company decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize particular businesses. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal data to prospective or actual purchasers or receiving it from sellers.

Disclosure for other reasons. We may disclose personal data if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual.

Google Maps: Our mobile apps incorporate a Google product called Google Maps API for Business or “Google Maps”. Google Maps will help end users like you locate Chevron and Texaco branded stations and ExtraMile stores using our mobile apps and may provide other features and services through the mobile apps.

Google will then be able to display, through the mobile apps, nearby Chevron- and Texaco-branded gas stations and ExtraMile-branded locations that accept mobile payments and/or participate in the Chevron Texaco Rewards program and the ExtraMile Rewards program. Google may use the information we provide through the mobile apps in various ways. To understand how Google may use that information, make sure you read Google’s
Privacy Policy
, which is a distinct policy and notice document from this Mobile Apps Privacy Statement.
If at any point in time you decide you do not wish to consent to any of the above Google terms, you must uninstall the mobile apps immediately. There is no other way to revoke or opt out of the Google Maps functionality and its associated terms, restrictions, and data privacy implications.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup

, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites.

When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Definitions
section below.
We revise this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes to our business, Services, or applicable laws. If the revised version requires notice in accordance with applicable law, we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the change on the "

service providers) involved in a transaction is subject to the Partners' and Merchants' own privacy policies and
procedures. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of Partners and Merchants.
Other third parties
, for example we disclose Personal Information to advertising platforms at your direction, or security service providers to help prevent unauthorized access to our Services.
Please be aware that these parties’ privacy notice applies to the Personal Information that you share directly with them
. For example, we use Google’s reCAPTCHA to prevent misuse of our Services, when you access our mobile application. We may also use Google Address Autofill to ensure accuracy of your address. Google’s
Privacy Policy
and
Terms of Use
apply to the Personal Information you share with them.
Buyers or in connection with business transfer
,
for example if we are involved in a merger, a purchase or sale of all or part of our business or assets, including receivables and debts, we may disclose, under appropriate data protection terms, your Personal Information to an interested or actual buyer of those business or assets. If PayPal or a significant portion of PayPal’s assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Information may also be disclosed.
How long does PayPal store your Personal Information?
We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or is permitted in context of the purpose for which it was collected and consistent with applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention period is as follows:
Personal Information used for the ongoing relationship between you and PayPal is stored for the duration of the relationship plus a period of 10 years, unless we need to keep it longer, such as:
a legal obligation or compliance with laws to which we are subject is retained consistent with the applicable law, such as under applicable bankruptcy laws and AML obligations
litigation, investigations, audit and compliance practices, or to protect against legal claims.
We retain biometric data for as long as needed or permitted given the purpose for which it was collected and no more than 3 years after your account closes, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?
When you interact with our Services, open email we send you, or visit a third-party website for which we provide Services, we and our partners use cookies and other tracking technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, and widgets (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a user, customize your online experiences and online content, including to serve you interest-based advertising, perform analytics; mitigate risk and prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Services.
We use Cookies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and generate inferences as described above.
You can disable or decline some Cookies for our Services. But, since some parts of our service rely on Cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.
Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.
If you want to know more about how we use cookies, please review our
Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Your Data Protection Rights
Your rights to access, correction, deletion, and restriction to use or share your Personal Information.
Under applicable data protection law, depending upon the jurisdiction in which you reside and subject to applicable exceptions and definitional differences among various state laws, you may have certain rights about how your Personal Information is collected, stored, used and shared.
We recognize the importance of your ability to control the use of your Personal Information and provide several ways for you to exercise your rights to access (right to know your information), right to know third-parties to which we have disclosed Personal Information, correction, deletion (erasure), and to restrict certain information (right to opt-out of sharing and right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information).
Certain state laws also provide residents of those states with the right to opt out of the “sale” (disclosing Personal Information in exchange for money or other consideration) or “sharing” (disclosing Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising) of your Personal Information or use of your Personal Information for certain types of targeted advertising.  Global Privacy Control settings is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. PayPal does not respond to the Global Privacy Control signal because we do not sell or share your data.
We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights; although, certain personalized services for PayPal customers may not provide the same level of personalization with limited data sharing. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we handle your
Privacy Rights
.
How do you exercise your rights?
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information,
contact us
or submit your request from your account settings. If you have a PayPal account, you can exercise your privacy rights by accessing “Data and Privacy” from account settings in the PayPal app.
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information in your Fastlane profile,
contact us
or submit your request from your Fastlane profile management portal.
Even if you do not have a PayPal account (for example, where you use Pay without a PayPal account), you can submit a request for access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at the number provided in our
Contact Information
section.
We’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.
Your
right to request a copy of the Personal Information
. If you want to request the data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months, you have choices:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and submit a request
Call or contact us
and request that we provide you with the data we’ve collected.
Your right
to correct your Personal Information:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and correct any information that you've previously added. For example, you can edit your addresses in your settings
Call or contact us
and request that we correct specific information
Your right
to delete your Personal Information:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and delete any information that you've previously added. For example, you may delete your non-primary addresses in your settings
Call us or contact us
and request that we delete specific information
Close your PayPal or Xoom account or Fastlane profile
If you close your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile, or request that we delete Personal Information, we still need to keep some Personal Information as explained in
How long does PayPal store your Personal Information
section so we can:
Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the user agreement or other contract you have with us
Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity
Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech
Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our Services
Comply with laws and other legal or governmental processes
California also offers a right to opt out of “Selling” and “Sharing” Personal Information. The Global Privacy Control setting is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their personal information. PayPal does not respond to these settings because we do not sell or share data. Some personal information collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution are subject to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our
Consumer Privacy Notice
for more information about their rights under US federal law.
Understanding your choices
You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.
Choose how we collect Personal Information
You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function.
For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.
Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information
If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.
You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.
Choose what we disclose with other Users
Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.
Choose what we share with Partners and Merchants for Personalized Shopping
Unless we are required by law to obtain your consent, we share Personal Information collected after November 27, 2024 (or from earlier if you consent) for personalized shopping experiences. Personal Information we disclose includes, for example, products, preferences, sizes, and styles we think you’ll like. To opt-out of Personal Information sharing with Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences, log into your PayPal account and edit your preferences in the Data and Privacy setting. If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.
Choose how we communicate with you
Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Fastlane profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.
You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal or Fastlane marketing email, opt-out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.
You won’t be able to opt-out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account or Fastlane profile's status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.
How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?
We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and account/Fastlane profile registration information and verifying that the Personal Information we maintain about you is accurate and current. We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that we share with a third-party based on a linked account connection that you have authorized.
Can Children Use Our Services?
We do not knowingly collect information, including Personal Information, from children under the age of 13 or other individuals who are not legally allowed to use our Services. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Information from someone not allowed to use our Services, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data.
Please
contact us
if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from someone not allowed to use our Services.
We do not sell to third parties for money, or share Personal Information of anyone under 16 years of age, for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising.

CCPA California Notice at Collection
Most of the Personal Information we collect is subject to federal and state privacy laws that apply to financial institutions. To the extent the Personal Information is not subject to these federal and state financial privacy laws and to the extent it is collected in California about California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may apply. The following section pertains only to Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA (“CCPA personal information”) and makes statements that reference unique definitions and requirements of law.
This CCPA California Notice at Collection describes: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “CCPA personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose CCPA personal information for a business purpose, and/or (b) “share” CCPA personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or (c) “sell” such CCPA personal information, as applicable.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the sharing or disclosure of CCPA personal information by a business to a third party, for the targeting of advertising to a consumer, based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s CCPA activity across businesses, websites, applications, or services, other than those with which a consumer uses or directs a business to internally disclose CCPA personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties. “Selling” is defined as the disclosure of CCPA personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, but does not apply to such disclosures when a consumer uses or directs a business to intentionally disclose CCPA personal information or interact with one or more third parties.
We do not sell or share your CCPA personal information, including any Sensitive CCPA personal information, outside the exceptions.
We also do not sell or share, and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any CCPA personal information of anyone under 16 years of age.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose CCPA personal information, please see the “Categories of Personal Information We Collect”, “How is Personal Information used,” and “Do We Disclose Personal Information” sections.

Checking Pay, POWERED BY SPIRE, USER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Version 1.03 Effective Dec 4, 2024
YOUR ACCESS OF Checking Pay, POWERED BY SPIRE, SERVICES AND YOUR AGREEMENT BELOW MEANS YOU HAVE ACCEPTED ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF, AT ANY TIME, YOU NO LONGER AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST CALL SPIRE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT 888-823-2438 TO CLOSE YOUR Checking Pay ACCESS.  FOR AS LONG AS YOUR ACCESS IS ACTIVE, YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
THIS AGREEMENT CAN BE ACCEPTED ONLY BY AN ADULT 18 YEARS OR OLDER. BY USING THIS APPLICATION, OR BY ESTABLISHING Checking Pay ACCESS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING AGREEMENT WITH SPIRE. IF YOU DO NOT MEET THIS REQUIREMENT, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APPLICATION.  IF YOU ESTABLISH Checking Pay ACCESS AND YOU DO NOT MEET THE AGE REQUIREMENT, WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY OF YOUR SUBSEQUENT PURCHASES OR ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS.
Through Checking Pay, Pay With Spire, Inc., (“Spire”, “we” or “us”), provides access to services (collectively, the “Services”) that allow you to use Checking Pay as a method of payment (“Payment”) at any retail locations operating under the Chevron® or Texaco® brands (collectively, “Branded Locations”). In this Terms of Service, “Customer”, “user” or “you” means any person using the Service.
This agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to the use of this website and/or mobile application on which Spire provides the Service to you. READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you may not use Checking Pay. Void where prohibited. Neither Apple, Inc. (App Store), Google, Inc. (Google Play), nor any other app store or marketplace is responsible for the Services or any contents.
1.   Acceptance Of Terms.
By using this website or application (other than to read this agreement for the first time), by indicating acceptance of this agreement, by using Checking Pay, by signing up for Checking Pay, or otherwise using the services, you are entering into this agreement with Spire and agree to comply with these terms and conditions and our privacy policy, available at
https://www.paywithspire.com/privacy/
.  Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Pay With Spire Inc.
2.   Consent to Electronic Disclosures and Notices; Paper Copies.
As part of your relationship with Spire, we want to ensure you have the information you need to effectively manage your Checking Pay access. We are required by law to give you certain information “in writing,” which means you are entitled to receive it on paper. We may, however, provide some of this information to you electronically, instead, with your prior consent. By accepting this Agreement, you agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures (collectively, “Electronic Communications”) that Spire and Chevron we provide in connection with Checking Pay.

Communications will be provided online and viewable using in-app display features, browser software or .pdf files. In such cases, you will be able to print the Electronic Communication and/or have it emailed to you.
Electronic communications will be deemed received by you within 24 hours of the time such communication is posted or sent to you. You agree that if we send you an Electronic Communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive Electronic Communications, we will be deemed to have provided the Electronic Communication to you. You may not be able to transact using Checking Pay until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you. You may print or save a copy of these Electronic Communications for your records as they may not be accessible online later.

3. Description of the Service.
Upon completion of the Enrollment Application ("Application") and acceptance by Spire, you will become eligible to use Checking Pay, powered by Spire. Your Checking Pay access is not a bank account. Spire is not a bank, and does not offer banking or money service business ("MSB") services as those terms are defined by the United States Department of Treasury.  The Services allow merchants, from whom you buy goods or services, to directly debit your bank account as payment for goods and services.
4.   Enrollment Requirements.
To use Checking Pay or engage in any of the other Spire Services, you must enroll with us, in addition to any enrollment you may do with Chevron.  If you register as a Customer or otherwise use Checking Pay, you represent and warrant to Spire that: (i) you are 18 or older; (ii) you have provided a valid and functional email address which is owned and operated by you (pseudo, relay, or hidden email addresses may not be used); (iii) your enrollment and use of the Service is not prohibited by law; (iv) the account with your mobile service provider for the mobile device on which you are using Checking Pay is current and in good standing; (v) you will not use Checking Pay outside of the United States or Puerto Rico, for international transfers, or for any transaction requiring payment in foreign currency; and (vi) you have provided true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Application (such information being the "Enrollment Data") and maintain and promptly update such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. For your convenience, some of this data may be pre-populated by Chevron, but you must review and correct it if/as applicable. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if Spire has reasonable grounds to suspect that such data is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Spire has the right to suspend or terminate your enrollment, or your access to the Service and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). By enrolling in and using the Service, in addition to the terms of this Agreement, you agree to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. You will maintain the security of your access, take responsibility for all activities that occur using your access, and accept all risks of unauthorized access resulting from your acts or omissions.  You shall not share your phone, password, PIN or any of your credentials used for Spire Services nor use the Service through using the enrollment of any third party. You should not allow anyone else to access, use or borrow your Checking Pay access. Your enrollment, and this Agreement, is personal to you, and is not transferrable by you to any third party without the prior written consent of Spire.
You further represent that you will create and/or use only one checking account and are thereby entitled to the benefits of only one Checking Pay access when using the Spire Payment or Service(s). This checking account must be a consumer account and must be able to accept ACH debits and credits from your financial institution. Any creation of additional Checking Pay access device(s) shall be considered a violation of this Agreement. By registering for Spire, you hereby agree to all fees and penalties that may be applied to your Checking Pay usage in the event Spire deems your use of the Checking Pay as a violation of this Agreement, or in any way against the intended purpose or interest of the Services, as well as immediate termination of your Checking Pay Access(s). You understand and agree that Spire may choose to employ a collection agency or other business in an effort to collect any outstanding debts or fees associated with your usage, and you will not contest the use of a third party to collect the fees owed to Spire.
You agree that you will be responsible for any legal, court, or collection agency fees associated with rectifying your Checking Pay usage and all monies owed thereunder. You agree that Spire, or any agency or business employed by Spire, has the right to contact you via telephone, email or in-person using the information you provided upon enrollment or during any contact with Spire, in an effort to collect any monies and fees owed as a result of your access, whether specifically referenced in this Section or not, and such contact may be made in a manual or automated fashion.
4.1 Compatible Mobile Device Operating System; Mobile Devices Generally.
In order to use Checking Pay at a point of sale terminal, you must have a compatible mobile device operating system that meets the specifications established by Spire in its sole discretion. Compatible mobile device operating systems may be established by Spire from time to time, but as of the effective date of this Agreement, compatible mobile device operating systems include Apple iOS and Android operating systems. A mobile device that has been modified contrary to the manufacturer’s or mobile service provider’s software or hardware guidelines, including, but not limited to, disabling hardware or software controls (e.g. “jailbreaking”), is not a compatible device with Checking Pay for purposes of this Agreement. The use of any modified mobile device with Checking Pay is a violation of this Agreement and is grounds for the immediate termination of your Checking Pay access by Spire without notice to you, in Spire’s sole discretion. You understand and agree you are still subject to the terms and conditions of any agreement you have with any mobile service provider (e.g. AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.) or any app store or marketplace for Checking Pay (e.g. Apple, Inc., or Google, Inc. (Android)), and this Agreement does not amend or supersede any of those separate agreements. You understand that such services may provide for fees, charges, limitations and restrictions which might impact your use of Checking Pay (e.g. data use charges, etc.), and you agree to be solely responsible for all such fees, charges, limitations and restrictions. You agree that only your mobile service provider is responsible for the performance and operation of its products and services, including your mobile device and the mobile service provider’s own network. You agree to resolve any problems with your mobile service provider without involving Spire, Apple, Inc., Google, Inc. (Android), or any other operator of an app store or marketplace. You must comply with applicable third party terms when using Checking Pay (e.g. you cannot be in violation of your wireless provider agreement when using Checking Pay.)
5.   Enrollee Authorizations.
When enrolling in Checking Pay, you are authorizing Spire, authorized vendors, and designees to verify your identity, verify your bank account, verify your equipment, and confirm you are the owner of the bank account that you would like to use. This may include asking you for further information and/or documentation about your account usage or identity, or requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, mobile number, or financial accounts, and verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources. This process is for identity verification purposes.
There are two ways of verifying your bank information: Instant Account Verification which uses methods such as entering your banking credentials from participating banks or, alternatively, Spire can apply one or more challenge deposit/withdrawal transactions to a checking account you specify and subsequently ask you to verify those transaction amounts. Where applicable, when enrolling using one of the Instant Account Verification options:
(i) You authorize your wireless operator (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, Verizon, or any other branded wireless operator) to disclose your mobile number, name, address, email, ACH or credit card information, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber status details, if available, to Spire to allow verification of your identity, to compare information you have provided to Spire with your wireless operator account profile information, and to autofill this form with your mobile operator account profile and payment information, for the duration of the business relationship.  You further authorize Spire to request your mobile carrier (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, Verizon, or any other branded wireless carrier) to use your mobile subscriber details for verifying your identity and to autofill this form.  Those details may include name, billing address, email, phone number, mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber status details. Spire will store your information throughout the tenure of our business relationship.  See our
Privacy Policy
for how we treat your data.
(ii)   You also hereby grant Spire or its authorized vendor(s) a limited power of attorney, and you hereby appoint Spire and its authorized vendor(s) as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution and re-substitution, for you and in your name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to access third party internet sites, servers or documents, retrieve information, and use your information, all as described above, with the full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with such activities, as fully to all intents and purposes as you might or could do in person. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN SPIRE OR ITS AUTHORIZED VENDOR(S) ACCESSES AND RETRIEVES INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY SITES, SPIRE AND/OR ITS AUTHORIZED VENDOR(S) ARE ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT THE AGENT OR ON BEHALF OF Chevron OR ANY THE THIRD PARTY. You agree that third party account providers shall be entitled to rely on the foregoing authorization, agency and power of attorney granted by you.
(iii) You understand and agree that the methods by which Spire will verify you and your information through Instant Account Verification are not endorsed or sponsored by any third party account providers used in the process. You understand that if you have arranged for additional security controls, such as two-factor authentication with a third party account provider, the third party account provider may not require Spire to apply such security controls to use Checking Pay. You are licensing to Spire or its authorized vendor(s) any information, data, passwords, materials or other content (collectively, “Content”) you provide or that is obtained on your behalf through or to the verification process. Spire or its authorized vendor(s) may use, modify, display, distribute and create new material using such Content during the verification process or in providing Checking Pay. By submitting Content, you automatically agree, without any time limit, and without the payment of any fees, Spire or its authorized vendor(s) may use the Content during the verification and enrollment process, and use and store the information in order to provide Checking Pay to you.  As between Spire or its authorized vendor(s), Spire owns your confidential account information. You agree not to reverse engineer or reverse compile any of the service technology, including but not limited to, any Java applets associated with the verification or enrollment process.
Additionally, Spire may share data with third parties to verify your identity and authenticate information presented during enrollment. This may include sharing data to prevent actual or potential fraud or fraudulent activity. You are also expressly authorizing Spire or Spire's authorized vendor(s) the right, power and authority to (acting on your behalf) store, access and transmit your personal and financial information (such as from your bank) as reasonably necessary for Spire to provide Checking Pay to you. You also are authorizing Spire or Spire's authorized vendor(s) to access information from third parties to prevent fraud or fraudulent activity. See Spire’s
Privacy Policy
for how Spire treats your data.
By agreeing to this Agreement, you are authorizing Spire, its merchants, third party payment processors or other authorized vendors, and designees, to initiate Automated Clearing House (ACH) debit and credit entries to your account at the depository institution designated in the Application and to debit or credit such account on behalf of Chevron, for the verification of your checking account, or to collect any debts or fees owed under this Agreement. You can only use this service to pay for goods and services purchased at authorized merchants.
You understand that ACH transactions may take several days to post to your bank account. When you conduct this type of transaction, you are responsible for ensuring that the funds are available at the time the transaction is conducted and processed (posts) to your account.
You acknowledge that the origination of ACH transactions to your account must comply with the provisions of U.S. law. You also authorize Spire and its authorized vendors and designees to provide transaction history information to Chevron.
If you enroll in Checking Pay, you represent and warrant that you have authority to make withdrawals from and otherwise authorize debits and credits to the checking account designated in the Application. In the event that your bank does not allow electronic transactions, you authorize us or our authorized vendor(s) or designee(s) to convert the electronic transaction data to a paper draft for presentment to your bank. If any payment is returned for any reason (including NSF, Account Closed/Frozen, stop payment, account not found, etc.), you agree to pay Spire or its designee the amount of any ACH which is returned, plus the amount of the returned ACH fee and sales tax, as applicable per state law, along with any other applicable fees. Returned ACHs may be electronically re-presented to your bank for collection by Spire or its designee and will be debited by ACH from your account, without further notice, which procedures you authorize. You also agree to pay Spire or its designee a service charge for each ACH returned for any reason, equal to an amount up to the maximum fee under applicable state law or, if there is no maximum established by applicable state law, $35, which amount you agree is a reasonable minimum service charge. You also authorize the automatic debiting of such service charges and fees by ACH from your account. This fee is separate from any fees that your bank may impose for such returns.
We may share data with third parties to verify your identity and the validity of the data presented during enrollment.  By accepting this Agreement, you are authorizing us or our authorized vendor(s) to access information from third parties to verify your identity, to prevent fraud, and to authenticate information used to subscribe to Checking Pay in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
6.   Plastic Access Devices (where applicable).
If offered by Chevron and upon your request, Spire hereby agrees to provide you with a plastic access device for the Services as outlined in this Agreement and in accordance with the terms outlined herein. The plastic access device shall remain the property of Spire and is issued solely for your use as the authorized user named herein. Spire reserves the right to deactivate or suspend the plastic access device at any time and for any reason deemed necessary by Spire, without liability. You acknowledge receipt of the plastic access device and agree to use it solely for its intended purpose and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement. You further agree not to transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of the plastic access device to any third party without prior written consent from Spire.
7.   Our Privacy Policy.
This Agreement and your submission of data through enrollment, and use of Checking Pay are governed by our Privacy Policy (the terms of which are incorporated herein). In certain circumstances, we may be collecting and securely storing some of your personally identifying information, including your location and Geographic Information Systems (“GIS”) data. Please review the Privacy Policy to learn more about how we hold or may use your personal information. We urge you to read this policy now and revisit it later at your convenience, because the policy is updated from time to time.

8.   License to Use the Service.

You may not remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices that have been placed on the Spire Property. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, any modification, reproduction, redistribution, republication, uploading, posting, transmitting, distributing or otherwise exploiting in any way the Spire Property, or any portion of the Spire Property, is strictly prohibited without the prior written permission of Spire.

You further agree that you will not, and will not permit any third party to, do or attempt to do any of the following: (a) access or monitor any material or information in Checking Pay using any manual process or robot, spider, scraper or other automated means; (b) copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell, loan or distribute any material or information provided to you by Spire; (c) use Checking Pay in any manner that would interfere with the rights of any third party; (d) take any action that could compromise the security of Checking Pay; (e) violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers in any aspect of Checking Pay, work around, bypass, or circumvent any of the technical limitations of Checking Pay, use any tool to enable disabled features or functionalities of Checking Pay, or decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of Checking Pay; (f) transfer any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (g) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the proper working of Checking Pay, prevent access to or use of Checking Pay by other users, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Spire’s infrastructure, including but not limited to excessively high volume data transfers or bandwidth use; or (h) otherwise use Checking Pay except as permitted by this Agreement.
You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining the computer, smartphone and other equipment you use to access Checking Pay, and for paying for such equipment and any telecommunications charges. We are not liable for any loss or damage you suffer arising from damage to equipment used in connection with use of Checking Pay. You agree that you will download and install any updates for Checking Pay as they become available.  If you do not, you recognize that Checking Pay may be unavailable until you download and install such updates.
If applicable, you shall be solely responsible for the safekeeping and proper use of the plastic access device. Any unauthorized use or disclosure shall be your sole responsibility.
8.1 Unacceptable Use of Checking Pay.
You agree not to use Checking Pay to: (i) distribute e-mail, instant messages, text messages or other communications in an illegal manner including but not limited to creating or sending hoax e-mail or chain e-mail, sending unsolicited commercial e-mail or bulk e-mail (aka spam or spamming), harvesting e-mail addresses, using open proxies or relays to allow spamming, impersonating someone else (aka spoofing) or falsifying message header information; (ii) gain unauthorized access to computer systems or engage in security attacks of any kind, including but not limited to security attacks against trust (such as e-mail spoofing, password cracking, IP spoofing and DNS poisoning), against confidentiality and integrity (by using malware such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, rootkits, keyloggers, spyware or other malicious programs and code), or against availability (such as denial of service and e-mail bombs); (iii) corrupt, modify or intercept electronic communications intended for any other person or entity; (iv) interfere with or disrupt the operation of Checking Pay; (v) conduct or engage in any illegal business or activity, infringe any third party intellectual property rights, collect, copy or process information in a way that breaches data protection laws or leads to a wrongful breach of privacy, or create, distribute, process or view any defamatory, obscene, indecent, pornographic, racist, sexist or otherwise discriminatory, misleading, deceptive, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable, offensive or illegal material; or (vi) use Checking Pay for eligibility determinations regarding consumers for credit, insurance, employment, or any other “permissible purpose” as defined in Section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”).
9.   Proprietary Rights.
Much of the text, images, sound, music, marks, logos, compilations (meaning the collection, arrangement and assembly of information) and other content on Checking Pay mobile application (collectively, the “Site Content”), and software embodied in the mobile application or otherwise used by Spire to deliver the Service (“Software”), is proprietary to us or to third parties (which shall be presented upon request) and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, any use, exploitation, copying, making derivative works, transmitting, posting, linking, deep linking, redistribution, sale, decompilation, modification, reverse engineering, translation or disassembly of the Software or Site Content is prohibited. You may be subject to criminal or civil penalties for violation of this paragraph.
The mark “Spire” and the Spire logo are trademarks of Spire, and they may not be used in connection with any service or products other than those provided by Spire, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that disparages or discredits Spire. The Service also features the trademarks, service marks, and logos of merchants and other third parties, and each owner retains all rights in such marks. Any use of such marks, or any others displayed on the Service, will inure solely to the benefit of their respective owners.
10.   Service
(a) 	Through Checking Pay, Spire can be used as a method of payment for goods or services offered by Chevron locations, and/or for access to coupons, discount program(s), and/or or marketing communications. You must have enrolled with us to engage Checking Pay and/or available promotions. When you engage in Checking Pay or Promotions, you are bound by this Agreement and any other program-specific Terms.
(b)	Transaction types and limitations
i.
Access.
You may only use Checking Pay to pay for purchases at approved merchants.
ii.
Limitations on dollar amounts and frequency of Payments
— For security reasons, limits may be placed on the dollar amounts of individual transactions allowed on your Checking Pay account, the frequency of those transactions and/or on the cumulative dollar amounts of all transactions over a rolling day basis allowed on your Checking Pay account. These limitations may change from time to time in our sole discretion. The restrictions may exist even if you have funds in your checking account at the time you are attempting to use Checking Pay.
(c) 	Any coupon or discount program is specific to the issuer and/or merchant, and (unless otherwise noted therein) any corresponding Promotions (defined hereinafter) may not be used for goods and services from any other issuer and/or merchant. The issuer is solely responsible for all aspects of the coupons and/or discount program, honoring the coupons and/or discount program’s rewards and/or incentives (individually or collectively “Promotions”), any liabilities, injuries, losses or damages you may suffer in connection with the use of the coupons or discount program, and any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed Promotions, or any portion thereof. You acknowledge that Spire is not responsible for redeeming Promotions, or for any matter relating to the coupons or discount program or the Service in general.
(d) The Service is subject to the following conditions:
i. Any fraudulent use of Checking Pay or promotions in violation of this Agreement or any other applicable terms renders the payment void. The Spire Payment and Promotion are void to the extent prohibited by law.
ii. Unless expressly allowed by the merchant, Promotions cannot be combined with any other offers, certificates or promotions.
iii. Promotions may only be applied to goods or services sold by the merchant, and may not be applied to delivery, processing or handling fees. The Promotion may not be applied to gratuities, tax, or (unless expressly permitted by the merchant) gift cards, money orders or lottery tickets, or alcoholic beverages.
iv. iv.	Other than as provided below, the Promotion is only available only until the expiration date specified within the Service, or within the Promotion itself, or until issuer and/or merchant cancels the Promotion. However, some laws may require that Promotions have certain validity periods or require that Promotions not expire. If those laws apply, Spire will honor your legal entitlement to, as applicable, a credit for goods or services from the merchant beyond the expiration date. If such laws apply, you should contact Spire and request a credit or refund by emailing us at CheckingPay@paywithspire.com.
v. If the merchant permits use of Promotions for alcoholic beverages, some state laws may limit the redemption of Promotions for alcoholic beverages. The Promotions are valid only to the extent redemption is permitted by law. In addition, you acknowledge that Spire and merchants may offer some Promotions only to customers in certain age brackets, and you will not use any Promotion if you are not a member of the appropriate age bracket. The issuer and/or merchant is responsible for compliance with applicable laws with respect to the Spire Payment and issuance and redemption of the Promotion.
11.   Third Party Websites.
The mobile application may contain links to third-party websites. The linked sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for the contents of any linked site. We provide these links as a convenience only, and a link does not imply endorsement of, sponsorship of, or affiliation with the linked site by Spire. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any of these third parties.
12.   Ideas Submitted to Us.
We are pleased to hear from you and welcome your comments about Checking Pay. If you submit ideas or suggestions for Checking Pay, the comments will be deemed, and will remain, our sole property. None of the comments will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Spire, and Spire will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any comments. Without limiting the foregoing, we will be entitled to unrestricted use and other exploitation of the comments for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, by any means, by any media, without compensation to the provider, author, creator or inventor of the comments.
12.1 TCPA Disclosure/User Permission for Text Messaging/Alerts, Push Notifications and E-Mail.
You grant Spire or those third party service providers acting on Spire’s behalf, express written consent to receiving autodialed and prerecorded message calls, text messages or push notification alerts from Spire at any mobile telephone number you provide to Spire, regardless of your enrollment of your mobile device number on any state or federal “do not call” registry. Your express, written permission applies to messages and alerts regarding Checking Pay and any additional Services that Spire provides. By providing your email address to Spire, you agree that Spire, or those Third Party Services providers acting on Spire’s behalf, may e-mail you Checking Pay enrollment information, electronic transaction summaries and related information, and Checking Pay use information with regard to Checking Pay, customer service, in the case of fraud/suspected fraud inquiries, consumer dispute resolution, collections, or any other action related to providing Checking Pay to you regardless of your registration of your email address on any state or federal “do not email” registry. With regard to any text messages, alerts or email relating to Checking Pay, Spire will not include any full account numbers, access codes or similar non-public personal information in such message.
13.   Our Liability for Failure to Complete Transactions.
If we delay or do not complete a transfer from your account in the correct amount according with our agreement with you, our liability shall be limited to your direct damages. However, there are some exceptions. To the extent allowed by law, we, Chevron and the merchants, will not be liable for indirect damages, consequential damages (including lost profits), extraordinary damages, special or punitive damages including, without limitation, lost profits or attorney’s fees, even if we are advised in advance of the possibility of such damages. We, and the merchants, will not be liable, for instance:
(a) If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer;
(b) If a merchant refuses to accept your Checking Pay access;
(c) If an electronic terminal where you are making a transaction does not operate properly;
(d) If your Checking Pay access has been blocked, such as when you have unpaid transactions under this Agreement, transaction limitations are in place, or after you reported your phone, other access device or credentials are lost or stolen;
(e) If there is a hold or your access is restricted because of a legal process or other encumbrance restricting its use;
(f) If we have reason to believe the requested transaction is unauthorized;
(g) If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood or computer or communication failure) prevent the completion of the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.
Except for any other remedy described herein, your sole and exclusive remedy, and Spire’s and Chevron’ sole and exclusive liability, for any breach of this Agreement or for any other cause of action shall be (at Spire’s option) to remedy the failure or to give a credit to you of the amount owed.
14.   Warranty, Limitation.
Spire does not warrant that Checking Pay or Spire Property will operate error-free or without downtime. We may pause or interrupt Checking Pay at any time, and users should expect periodic downtime for updates to Checking Pay. Because we do not control the security of the Internet, or other networks you use, Spire is not responsible for the security of information that you choose to communicate with Spire or the merchant while it is being transmitted. Additionally, Spire is not responsible for any data lost during transmission. You will bear the liability or the risk of any error or loss of data, information, transactions or other losses, which may be due to the failure of your respective computer system or third party communications provider on which you may rely. We shall have no liability to you for any damage or other loss, direct or consequential, which you may incur by reason of your use of your computer system, including but not limited to damage or loss resulting from date related problems. Where applicable, Spire’s liability for any damages arising from the issuance, use, or non-use of the plastic access device shall be limited to the extent permitted by law, and in no event shall exceed the value of the device at the time of issuance.
Checking Pay, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT, SOFTWARE, FUNCTIONS, MATERIALS AND INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE ON, PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH OR ACCESSIBLE THOUGH Checking Pay, IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE”, AND “WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS. WE DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THAT THE SYSTEM WILL OPERATE WITHOUT ERRORS, OR THAT ANY OR ALL SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE AND OPERATIONAL AT ALL TIMES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Spire AND ITS AFFILIATES, MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARD TO Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION), INCLUDING ALL CONTENT, SOFTWARE, FUNCTIONS, MATERIALS AND INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE ON, PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH OR ACCESSIBLE THOUGH Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SPIRE, ITS AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS, DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY CONTENT OF Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION) IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT YOUR USE OF Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION) WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; THAT Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION) WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; THAT ANY DEFECT OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION) IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. SPIRE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SYSTEM FAILURES OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS THAT MAY AFFECT THE RECEIPT, PROCESSING, ACCEPTANCE, COMPLETION OR SETTLEMENT OF PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS INITIATED BY YOU THROUGH Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION). IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH Checking Pay, ANY CONTENT THEREON OR THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF Checking Pay.  SPIRE AND ITS AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH Checking Pay (INCLUDING INSTANT ACCOUNT VERIFICATION).  No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Spire or through Checking Pay will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL YOU BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM SPIRE, Chevron, OR ANY MERCHANT OR ANY OF OUR VENDORS ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF USE, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO Checking Pay, SPIRE PROPERTY, ANY INCENTIVES ANY GOODS AND SERVICES PURCHASED, EVEN IF SPIRE OR SUCH MERCHANT HAS BEEN INFORMED OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
SPIRE’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH Checking Pay OR ANY DISCOUNT PROGRAM, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION IN QUESTION PLUS $100. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES OR OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
15.   Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers and Misuse or Damage to Plastic Access Devices.

17.   Error Resolution Procedures.

Spire will not be providing you with regular or periodic statements regarding your transactions. You should be able to see the transactions conducted using your checking account on the statement provided by the financial institution holding your checking account. The financial institution holding your account will make periodic statements available to you. SAVE THE RECEIPTS YOU ARE GIVEN WHEN YOU USE Checking Pay, AND CHECK THEM AGAINST THE ACCOUNT STATEMENT YOU RECEIVE FROM THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HOLDING YOUR ACCOUNT, YOUR BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. If you have any questions about one of these transactions, call us at: 888-823-2438 or write us at: CheckingPay@paywithspire.com. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after your financial institution sent you the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.

(b) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.
(c) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days. We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly if you have not been credited by your financial institution. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we may credit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account. For errors involving new enrollments, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new enrollments, we may take up to 20 business days to credit your account for the amount you think is in error.

You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

17.1 Disclosure Regarding Use of Checking Pay:

The terms, benefits, and protections associated with your Checking Pay access may vary from those that apply to a debit card issued by your Bank. For example, if you use your Checking Pay access to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in the deposit account that you linked to the Checking Pay access, that account may become overdrawn even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with respect to a debit card issued by your Bank, and you may incur associated overdraft fees.

Please see Section 13 for an explanation of your liability when using Checking Pay.
