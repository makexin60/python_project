PERSONAL INFORMATION WE RECEIVE
“Personal Information” means any data that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, is linked to, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a person or household or any other data or information that constitutes “personal data,” “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information” under applicable privacy laws. When you use our Services we receive Personal Information in a variety of ways, including directly from you and/or your devices, from third parties (including our affiliates, banking partners, your employer, and other users), from publicly available sources, and through information that we collect automatically. We may receive the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers
: We receive identifiers, such as name, email, login credentials, address, phone number, password, date of birth, Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, military status, driver’s license or other government issued identification and numbers, and country of citizenship.
Demographic Information
: We may receive demographic information, such as marital status, language preferences, citizenship status, race and gender, when such information is included in documents, such as government issued identification and tax forms and returns, that you share with us.
Biometric Information
: As part of verifying your account, we may ask you to upload to one of our service providers, Persona Identities, Inc. (“Persona”) a live selfie and a photo of your driver’s license or other government issued identification. Persona processes these images, including by generating data about your facial geometry (which may be considered biometric information in some jurisdictions) for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud. This may involve comparing the biometric information generated from your selfie to the biometric information generated from your ID, as well as comparing the biometric information generated from your images to the biometric information generated from other images. Persona stores the biometric information and uses it to perform ongoing identity-verification and fraud-prevention screenings and permanently deletes the data when it is no longer needed to fulfill those purposes, or within three years of the initial creation of the data, whichever is sooner. Persona relies on service providers to process the biometric information and other information for these purposes. For more information on Persona’s policies, please visit Persona’s Privacy Policy (
https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy
). Persona sends OnePay the results of these screenings, but not the biometric information used to perform them. OnePay does not have access to the biometric information generated by Persona to perform these services.
Geolocation Information
: We may receive geolocation information, which may include your precise geolocation, if you have location services enabled in the OnePay Apps (and with your consent, where required by applicable law), which we use for certain features such as allowing you to find nearby ATMs and providing you with local rewards and deals.

Financial Information
: We receive financial information, such as bank account and routing numbers, debit and credit cards details, direct deposit status, credit score and credit history, as well as, in certain circumstances, the information described in each of the below sub-bullets, depending on the Services you use.
Linked Account Data

: When you apply for and use a third-party financial institution’s product or service that we make available to you through the OnePay Apps, we receive information related to your account with the financial institution, such as your account balance, transaction history, purchase history, and account status.
Transaction Information
: We may receive information about your transaction data, including payments into and out of your OnePay accounts, the date and time of the transaction, merchant or beneficiary details, or ATMs associated with the
transaction.

Transparency
: The CCPA requires that we notify consumers at or before the collection of their Personal Information of the categories of Personal Information we have collected about consumers in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources from which such Personal Information is collected, our purposes for collecting such Personal Information, whether such Personal Information is “sold” or “shared”, and the length of time we intend to retain each such category of Personal Information, or if that is not possible, the criteria we use to determine our retention periods, among other information. This Privacy Policy contains such information. Please read it, as well as any other terms that are provided to you at or before the collection of your Personal Information, carefully.
Access
: Right to request access to the categories of your Personal Information that we have collected, disclosed, or “sold”, as well as the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we have collected, the categories of sources from which we have collected such Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed, “sold” or “shared” such Personal Information, and our purposes for collecting, “selling” or “sharing” such Personal Information.
Correction

However, as is common practice among companies that operate online, we may use advertising and analytics services that are intended to analyze your interactions with our Services, based on information obtained from cookies or other trackers, including for delivering advertising to you (such as interest- based, targeted, or cross-context behavioral advertising). With respect to your interactions on www.onepay.com and the OnePay Apps we may disclose certain of this information, including device and usage information, to third parties, and such disclosure may be considered a “sale” and/or “sharing” of Personal Information under various state laws. You can opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information in a frictionless manner by implementing the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) in your browser. For instructions on how to download and use GPC, please visit

.  You can also opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information by clicking “Your Privacy Choices” on www.onepay.com . Your opt-out decision is specific to a particular device and browser. If you use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out on each. Additionally, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again. Please note that even if you opt out of the “sale” and “sharing” of your Personal Information, we may still use essential cookies to track your use of our Services, including for purposes of operating the Services and for legal and security reasons, such as detecting and preventing fraud. We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.
Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information

We only process such sensitive Personal Information in order to provide the Services, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, such that we are not required to provide the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive Personal Information.
Non-Discrimination
: The right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and Services or engage with you in the same manner.
Shine the Light
: California residents who have an established business relationship with us have the right to know how their information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law, (Civ. Code §1798.83). We do not share Personal Information with third parties for such purposes.
To exercise your rights, please submit a request by contacting us at support@onepay.com, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: One Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. We will acknowledge your request within 10 business days of receipt, and within 45 calendar days of receipt we will either provide a substantive response or notify you of an extension period of up to an additional 45
calendar days and a reason therefor. You can also correct and delete certain information directly in the OnePay Apps.
Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm your residency. To do so, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account, or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional Personal Information from you, including, but not limited to,
your email address and phone number.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems or where no U.S. state laws apply to our processing of your Personal Information because it is collected and processed subject to GLBA. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the
reasons for declining to comply with the request in our substantive response.
You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney. The authorized agent must provide a letter signed by you confirming the agent has permission to submit a request on your behalf or must provide sufficient evidence to show that the authorized agent has been lawfully vested with power of attorney. For security purposes, where authorized agent does not have power of attorney, we may need to verify your identity and confirm directly with you that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we will direct future communications to the consumer on whose behalf the request was made.
If we deny your request, some states afford you the right to appeal our decision. You may do so by contacting us at support@onepay.com, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: One Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. Within 45 days of receipt, we will notify you in writing of our decision and the reasons therefor.
6.
RETENTION
We may retain Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. In determining our retention periods, we use the following criteria: our relationship with you, the choices you have made with respect to your Personal Information, the permissibility of retention (including for backup and archival purposes), our legal and regulatory rights and obligations (including with respect to the prevention of fraud and abuse).
We do not delete your Personal Information upon deactivation of your account. Although your deactivated status is reflected promptly in our user databases, we may retain your Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including legal compliance, backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. Upon deactivation of your account, you will no longer receive emails from us and links to third-party financial accounts and services will automatically terminate. If you have a money transfer transaction pending at the time you deactivate your account, your link to this service from us will terminate but your pending transfer will continue to completion and your bank account will remain open.

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE RECEIVE
“Personal Information” means any data that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, is linked to, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a person or household or any other data or information that constitutes “personal data,” “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information” under applicable privacy laws. When you use our Services we receive Personal Information in a variety of ways, including directly from you and/or your devices, from third parties (including our affiliates, banking partners, your employer, and other users), from publicly available sources, and through information that we collect automatically. We may receive the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers
: We receive identifiers, such as name, email, login credentials, address, phone number, password, date of birth, Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, military status, driver’s license or other government issued identification and numbers, and country of citizenship.
Demographic Information
: We may receive demographic information, such as marital status, language preferences, citizenship status, race and gender, when such information is included in documents, such as government issued identification and tax forms and returns, that you share with us.
Biometric Information
: As part of verifying your account, we may ask you to upload to one of our service providers, Persona Identities, Inc. (“Persona”) a live selfie and a photo of your driver’s license or other government issued identification. Persona processes these images, including by generating data about your facial geometry (which may be considered biometric information in some jurisdictions) for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud. This may involve comparing the biometric information generated from your selfie to the biometric information generated from your ID, as well as comparing the biometric information generated from your images to the biometric information generated from other images. Persona stores the biometric information and uses it to perform ongoing identity-verification and fraud-prevention screenings and permanently deletes the data when it is no longer needed to fulfill those purposes, or within three years of the initial creation of the data, whichever is sooner. Persona relies on service providers to process the biometric information and other information for these purposes. For more information on Persona’s policies, please visit Persona’s Privacy Policy (
https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy
). Persona sends OnePay the results of these screenings, but not the biometric information used to perform them. OnePay does not have access to the biometric information generated by Persona to perform these services.

U.S. STATE RESIDENTS’ PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES
If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may have certain rights in addition to those set forth in our GLBA Privacy Notice to manage your Personal Information (other than Personal Information that we collect and process subject to GLBA) under U.S. state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the “CCPA”), as set forth below:
Transparency
: The CCPA requires that we notify consumers at or before the collection of their Personal Information of the categories of Personal Information we have collected about consumers in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources from which such Personal Information is collected, our purposes for collecting such Personal Information, whether such Personal Information is “sold” or “shared”, and the length of time we intend to retain each such category of Personal Information, or if that is not possible, the criteria we use to determine our retention periods, among other information. This Privacy Policy contains such information. Please read it, as well as any other terms that are provided to you at or before the collection of your Personal Information, carefully.
Access
: Right to request access to the categories of your Personal Information that we have collected, disclosed, or “sold”, as well as the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we have collected, the categories of sources from which we have collected such Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed, “sold” or “shared” such Personal Information, and our purposes for collecting, “selling” or “sharing” such Personal Information.
Correction
: Right to correct inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that information related to your creditworthiness is maintained by the credit bureaus. If you find that there is an error or you want to dispute the information found in your credit report, please contact the credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax.
Deletion
: Right to delete Personal Information about you, subject to certain exceptions.
Opt Out of Processing (“Sales”, “Sharing” and Targeted Advertising)
: We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). However, as is common practice among companies that operate online, we may use advertising and analytics services that are intended to analyze your interactions with our Services, based on information obtained from cookies or other trackers, including for delivering advertising to you (such as interest- based, targeted, or cross-context behavioral advertising). With respect to your interactions on www.onepay.com and the OnePay Apps we may disclose certain of this information, including device and usage information, to third parties, and such disclosure may be considered a “sale” and/or “sharing” of Personal Information under various state laws. You can opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information in a frictionless manner by implementing the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) in your browser. For instructions on how to download and use GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org
.  You can also opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information by clicking “Your Privacy Choices” on www.onepay.com . Your opt-out decision is specific to a particular device and browser. If you use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out on each. Additionally, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again. Please note that even if you opt out of the “sale” and “sharing” of your Personal Information, we may still use essential cookies to track your use of our Services, including for purposes of operating the Services and for legal and security reasons, such as detecting and preventing fraud. We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.
Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
:  We may receive certain information that is considered sensitive under the CCPA, such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers, race and citizenship status, biometric information and precise geolocation, as described in more detail in Section 2 above. We only process such sensitive Personal Information in order to provide the Services, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, such that we are not required to provide the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive Personal Information.
Non-Discrimination
: The right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and Services or engage with you in the same manner.
Shine the Light
: California residents who have an established business relationship with us have the right to know how their information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law, (Civ. Code §1798.83). We do not share Personal Information with third parties for such purposes.
To exercise your rights, please submit a request by contacting us at support@onepay.com, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: One Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. We will acknowledge your request within 10 business days of receipt, and within 45 calendar days of receipt we will either provide a substantive response or notify you of an extension period of up to an additional 45
calendar days and a reason therefor. You can also correct and delete certain information directly in the OnePay Apps.
Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm your residency. To do so, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account, or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional Personal Information from you, including, but not limited to,
your email address and phone number.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems or where no U.S. state laws apply to our processing of your Personal Information because it is collected and processed subject to GLBA. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the
reasons for declining to comply with the request in our substantive response.
You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney. The authorized agent must provide a letter signed by you confirming the agent has permission to submit a request on your behalf or must provide sufficient evidence to show that the authorized agent has been lawfully vested with power of attorney. For security purposes, where authorized agent does not have power of attorney, we may need to verify your identity and confirm directly with you that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we will direct future communications to the consumer on whose behalf the request was made.
If we deny your request, some states afford you the right to appeal our decision. You may do so by contacting us at support@onepay.com, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: One Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. Within 45 days of receipt, we will notify you in writing of our decision and the reasons therefor.

In determining our retention periods, we use the following criteria: our relationship with you, the choices you have made with respect to your Personal Information, the permissibility of retention (including for backup and archival purposes), our legal and regulatory rights and obligations (including with respect to the prevention of fraud and abuse).
We do not delete your Personal Information upon deactivation of your account. Although your deactivated status is reflected promptly in our user databases, we may retain your Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including legal compliance, backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. Upon deactivation of your account, you will no longer receive emails from us and links to third-party financial accounts and services will automatically terminate. If you have a money transfer transaction pending at the time you deactivate your account, your link to this service from us will terminate but your pending transfer will continue to completion and your bank account will remain open.
7.
CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If you believe that a child under the age of 16 may have provided us with Personal Information without parental consent, please contact us.
8.

This Privacy Policy covers our privacy practices only. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties, including third parties with whom we partner. Third-party websites, services and applications are governed by each such third party's privacy policy, which we encourage you to read carefully.

Privacy Policy applicable to individuals verifying their identity through the Persona Service
Persona’s Customers offer the Persona service (the “Service”) to securely verify the identity of individuals (“you”). Persona processes Personal Data of individuals at the direction of its Customers. This section of the Privacy Policy explains how Persona, under the direction of its Customers, processes Personal Data in order to provide the Service for its Customers. Personal Data provided to Persona by Customers, and Personal Data provided to Customers from Persona, is subject to the Customers’ Privacy Policy. This section explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect through the Service, how we use and share that data, and how individuals can exercise choices regarding their Personal Data.
How We Collect and Use Personal Data to Provide the Service
This section describes the Personal Data we collect and how we use it in order to provide the Service to our Customers. Personal Data means information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.
You provide Personal Data to us at the direction of our Customers so that our Customer may verify your identity and/or prevent fraud. In the course of performing the Service, we may also obtain Personal Data from other sources such as third party databases, government records, and other publicly available sources. The Personal Data we collect varies based on what you provide, what the Customer has directed us to analyze, and what Personal Data is available from third parties.
You may directly provide:
Name and contact information
, including name, email address, address, and phone number;
Demographic data
, including birthdate and age;
Files you upload,
such as tax forms and utility bills;
Government documents, barcodes, and identifiers
, such as driver's license and Social Security Number; and
Audio, Video, and Photos of you,
namely from the selfie you provide and from your government identification document.
Our Services may also collect the following from you, our Customer, or third parties:
Current and previous name and contact information
, including name, email address, address, and phone number;
Demographic data
, including birthdate and age, gender, marital status, and similar demographic details;
Government documents, barcodes, and identifiers
, such as drivers license and Social Security Numbers;
Device information
, including IP address, device type, your device’s operating system, browser, cookie and device identifiers, and other software including type, version, language, settings, and configuration;
Account information
, such as details about your account with our Customer or other third parties;
Geolocation data;
and
Biometric Data
, including a scan of your facial geometry based on the photos you provide. For more information about Biometric Data, see the Facial Scan and Biometrics Information section below.
Based on the Personal Data we collect from you and other sources, we infer information about you for identity verification and fraud prevention purposes.  For example, we may use certain information about you including your IP address and home address to inform our verification process.
Some data that we collect automatically is collected through cookies and similar technologies.  See our  Cookies section below to learn more.
We use Personal Data to provide our Customers with the Service so they can verify the identity of individuals and prevent fraud. This processing is necessary to perform our contract with our Customers. As part of performing the Service, we use Personal Data to improve and troubleshoot our Services.
Wireless Operator Authorization
To assist our customers  in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, you authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to us or our service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help them identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. See this Privacy Policy for how we treat your data.
How We Disclose Personal Data
We may engage third parties to assist us in providing the Services, in which case we may disclose Personal Data to them. We may also disclose Personal Data to service providers, including hosting, cloud services and other information technology services providers; email communication and SMS software providers; and identity verification services, mobile device operators, background check providers, public and private records database providers, consumer reporting services, and fraud and identity management providers. For example, we may disclose your name and address to a third party database provider in order to request information they may have about you. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process or store Personal Data while performing their duties to us. We may also disclose Personal Data when required to do so by law.
Facial Scan and Biometrics Information
This section describes how Persona treats scans of facial geometry extracted from photos.
Persona, acting as a service provider to the Customer:
compares the data from a scan of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document that you upload to the data from a scan of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload, in order to help verify your identity (“Verification”); and
may also use your information, including data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, to detect and prevent fraud (“Fraud Prevention”).
The images obtained from government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, and data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, are collected, used and stored directly by Persona on behalf of Customer as Customer’s service provider through Customer’s website or app that you accessed.  Depending on our relationship with the Customer, the Customer may upload your government identification document and photos of your face directly to us.
Persona securely stores all photos of identity documents that you upload, photos of your face that you upload, and data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload in an encrypted format. Persona’s
third-party vendors
may have access to the data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload to provide some or all of the analysis, to store the data, to maintain backup copies, and to service the systems on which such data is stored. Persona will permanently destroy data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload upon completion of Verification or within three years of your last interaction with Persona, consistent with the Customer’s instructions unless Persona is otherwise required by law or legal process to retain the data.
Persona uses the reasonable standards of care within its industry to store, transmit, and protect from disclosure data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload in a manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which it stores, transmits, and protects other confidential and sensitive information. Persona will not sell, lease, trade, or, other than to provide the Verification and Fraud Prevention services to Customer described in this policy, otherwise benefit from data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload. Other than as set forth herein, Persona will not disclose, redisclose, or otherwise disseminate data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload unless doing so:
Completes a Customer transaction requested and authorized by you or your legally authorized representative;
Is required by state or federal law, or municipal ordinance;
Is required pursuant to a warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or
Is expressly consented to by you.
Choices Regarding Personal Data
Persona is the data processor for the processing of Personal Data on behalf of its Customers. If you are an individual whose identity has been verified through Persona, please contact the appropriate Customer to exercise any rights that you may have under applicable law. If you have further concerns or questions regarding the processing of your Personal Data, please email
privacy@withpersona.com

Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the Personal Data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you receive a response from us informing you that we have declined your request, in whole or in part, you may appeal that decision by submitting your appeal as described in the
Contact Us
section below.

You can request access to, and rectification or erasure of, Personal Data;
If any automated processing of Personal Data is based on your consent or a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the Personal Data in a usable and portable format;
If the processing of Personal Data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent at any time for future processing;
You can object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of Personal Data under certain circumstances; and
For residents of France, you can send us specific instructions regarding the use of Personal Data after your death.
To make such requests please contact us as described in the
Contact Us
section below.  You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.
We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing Personal Data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.
California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident and the processing of Personal Data about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), you have certain rights with respect to that information.
Notice at Collection.
At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices,  including the
categories
of Personal Data, the
purposes
for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is
sold or shared
, and how long such information is
retained
. You can find those details in this policy by clicking on the above links.
Right to Know.
You have a right to request that we disclose to you the Personal Data we have collected about you.  You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such Personal Data. Note that we have provided much of this information in this privacy policy. You may make such a “request to know” by emailing us at
privacy@withpersona.com
.
Rights to Request Correction or Deletion.
You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Data and that we delete Personal Data under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to correct or delete, email us at
privacy@withpersona.com
.
Right to Opt-Out / “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”.
You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” or “sharing” of Personal Data as those terms are defined by the CCPA.
The CCPA/CPRA requires us to describe the categories of Personal Data we sell and/or share to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales or sharing.  The CCPA/CPRA defines “sell,” “share,” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this privacy policy may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under those definitions, such as  disclosing Personal Data to third parties for our own advertising purposes. We let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses and cookie IDs along with associated device and usage data when you access our website, but we do not “sell” or “share” any other types of Personal Data.
If you do not wish for us or our partners to “sell” or “share” Personal Data relating to your visits to our websites for advertising purposes, you can make your request by clicking on
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
page, using a Global Privacy Control, or emailing us at
privacy@withpersona.com
. If you opt-out using these choices, we will not share or make available such Personal Data in ways that are considered a “sale” or “sharing” under the CCPA.  However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some Personal Data to help us perform advertising-related functions. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” or “shared” Personal Data or stop all interest-based advertising.
We do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.
You have a right to limit our use of sensitive Personal Data for any purposes other than to provide the services or goods you request or as otherwise permitted by law. Note that we do not use Sensitive Personal Data for any such additional purposes.
You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA/CPRA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
Further, to provide, correct, or delete specific pieces of Personal Data will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account. For some types of Personal Data we may have, there may be no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity as the person to whom that data relates.
Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA/CPRA.
Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided Personal Data to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Data to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
Please be aware that we do not disclose Personal Data to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.
California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing
privacy@withpersona.com
. Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated e-mail address.

Contact Us

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC

Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE RECEIVE
“Personal Information” means any data that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, is linked to, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a person or household or any other data or information that constitutes “personal data,” “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information” under applicable privacy laws. When you use our Services we receive Personal Information in a variety of ways, including directly from you and/or your devices, from third parties (including our affiliates, banking partners, your employer, and other users), from publicly available sources, and through information that we collect automatically. We may receive the following categories of Personal Information:
Identifiers
: We receive identifiers, such as name, email, login credentials, address, phone number, password, date of birth, Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, military status, driver’s license or other government issued identification and numbers, and country of citizenship.
Demographic Information
: We may receive demographic information, such as marital status, language preferences, citizenship status, race and gender, when such information is included in documents, such as government issued identification and tax forms and returns, that you share with us.
Biometric Information
: As part of verifying your account, we may ask you to upload to one of our service providers, Persona Identities, Inc. (“Persona”) a live selfie and a photo of your driver’s license or other government issued identification. Persona processes these images, including by generating data about your facial geometry (which may be considered biometric information in some jurisdictions) for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud. This may involve comparing the biometric information generated from your selfie to the biometric information generated from your ID, as well as comparing the biometric information generated from your images to the biometric information generated from other images. Persona stores the biometric information and uses it to perform ongoing identity-verification and fraud-prevention screenings and permanently deletes the data when it is no longer needed to fulfill those purposes, or within three years of the initial creation of the data, whichever is sooner. Persona relies on service providers to process the biometric information and other information for these purposes. For more information on Persona’s policies, please visit Persona’s Privacy Policy (
https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy
). Persona sends OnePay the results of these screenings, but not the biometric information used to perform them. OnePay does not have access to the biometric information generated by Persona to perform these services.
Geolocation Information
: We may receive geolocation information, which may include your precise geolocation, if you have location services enabled in the OnePay Apps (and with your consent, where required by applicable law), which we use for certain features such as allowing you to find nearby ATMs and providing you with local rewards and deals. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling location permission for the OnePay Apps within your device settings.
Financial Information
: We receive financial information, such as bank account and routing numbers, debit and credit cards details, direct deposit status, credit score and credit history, as well as, in certain circumstances, the information described in each of the below sub-bullets, depending on the Services you use.
Linked Account Data
: When you link your bank account to OnePay, we receive financial information from your bank or financial institution, such as your account balance, transaction history, and information about the account owner.
Financial Institution Information
: When you apply for and use a third-party financial institution’s product or service that we make available to you through the OnePay Apps, we receive information related to your account with the financial institution, such as your account balance, transaction history, purchase history, and account status.
Transaction Information
: We may receive information about your transaction data, including payments into and out of your OnePay accounts, the date and time of the transaction, merchant or beneficiary details, or ATMs associated with the
transaction.

U.S. STATE RESIDENTS’ PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES
If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may have certain rights in addition to those set forth in our GLBA Privacy Notice to manage your Personal Information (other than Personal Information that we collect and process subject to GLBA) under U.S. state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the “CCPA”), as set forth below:
Transparency
: The CCPA requires that we notify consumers at or before the collection of their Personal Information of the categories of Personal Information we have collected about consumers in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources from which such Personal Information is collected, our purposes for collecting such Personal Information, whether such Personal Information is “sold” or “shared”, and the length of time we intend to retain each such category of Personal Information, or if that is not possible, the criteria we use to determine our retention periods, among other information. This Privacy Policy contains such information. Please read it, as well as any other terms that are provided to you at or before the collection of your Personal Information, carefully.
Access
: Right to request access to the categories of your Personal Information that we have collected, disclosed, or “sold”, as well as the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we have collected, the categories of sources from which we have collected such Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed, “sold” or “shared” such Personal Information, and our purposes for collecting, “selling” or “sharing” such Personal Information.
Correction
: Right to correct inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that information related to your creditworthiness is maintained by the credit bureaus. If you find that there is an error or you want to dispute the information found in your credit report, please contact the credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax.
Deletion
: Right to delete Personal Information about you, subject to certain exceptions.
Opt Out of Processing (“Sales”, “Sharing” and Targeted Advertising)
: We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). However, as is common practice among companies that operate online, we may use advertising and analytics services that are intended to analyze your interactions with our Services, based on information obtained from cookies or other trackers, including for delivering advertising to you (such as interest- based, targeted, or cross-context behavioral advertising). With respect to your interactions on www.onepay.com and the OnePay Apps we may disclose certain of this information, including device and usage information, to third parties, and such disclosure may be considered a “sale” and/or “sharing” of Personal Information under various state laws. You can opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information in a frictionless manner by implementing the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) in your browser. For instructions on how to download and use GPC, please visit
https://globalprivacycontrol.org
.  You can also opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising and the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information by clicking “Your Privacy Choices” on www.onepay.com . Your opt-out decision is specific to a particular device and browser. If you use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out on each. Additionally, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again. Please note that even if you opt out of the “sale” and “sharing” of your Personal Information, we may still use essential cookies to track your use of our Services, including for purposes of operating the Services and for legal and security reasons, such as detecting and preventing fraud. We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.
Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
:  We may receive certain information that is considered sensitive under the CCPA, such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers, race and citizenship status, biometric information and precise geolocation, as described in more detail in Section 2 above. We only process such sensitive Personal Information in order to provide the Services, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, such that we are not required to provide the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive Personal Information.
Non-Discrimination
: The right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and Services or engage with you in the same manner.
Shine the Light
: California residents who have an established business relationship with us have the right to know how their information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law, (Civ. Code §1798.83). We do not share Personal Information with third parties for such purposes.
To exercise your rights, please submit a request by contacting us at support@onepay.com, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: One Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. We will acknowledge your request within 10 business days of receipt, and within 45 calendar days of receipt we will either provide a substantive response or notify you of an extension period of up to an additional 45
calendar days and a reason therefor. You can also correct and delete certain information directly in the OnePay Apps.
Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm your residency. To do so, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account, or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional Personal Information from you, including, but not limited to,
your email address and phone number.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems or where no U.S. state laws apply to our processing of your Personal Information because it is collected and processed subject to GLBA. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the
reasons for declining to comply with the request in our substantive response.
You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney. The authorized agent must provide a letter signed by you confirming the agent has permission to submit a request on your behalf or must provide sufficient evidence to show that the authorized agent has been lawfully vested with power of attorney. For security purposes, where authorized agent does not have power of attorney, we may need to verify your identity and confirm directly with you that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we will direct future communications to the consumer on whose behalf the request was made.
If we deny your request, some states afford you the right to appeal our decision. You may do so by contacting us at support@onepay.com, 1-855-830-6200 or writing to us at: One Finance, Inc., P.O. Box 513717, Los Angeles, CA 90051. Within 45 days of receipt, we will notify you in writing of our decision and the reasons therefor.
6.
RETENTION
We may retain Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. In determining our retention periods, we use the following criteria: our relationship with you, the choices you have made with respect to your Personal Information, the permissibility of retention (including for backup and archival purposes), our legal and regulatory rights and obligations (including with respect to the prevention of fraud and abuse).
We do not delete your Personal Information upon deactivation of your account. Although your deactivated status is reflected promptly in our user databases, we may retain your Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including legal compliance, backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. Upon deactivation of your account, you will no longer receive emails from us and links to third-party financial accounts and services will automatically terminate. If you have a money transfer transaction pending at the time you deactivate your account, your link to this service from us will terminate but your pending transfer will continue to completion and your bank account will remain open.
7.
CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If you believe that a child under the age of 16 may have provided us with Personal Information without parental consent, please contact us.
8.
THIRD-PARTY PRIVACY PRACTICES
This Privacy Policy covers our privacy practices only. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties, including third parties with whom we partner. Third-party websites, services and applications are governed by each such third party's privacy policy, which we encourage you to read carefully. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and we are not responsible for the failure of third parties to honor their privacy obligations.
