        use and, if you came to the website, the type of internet browser you
        use and the website from which you have come to the site. Also,

        device, we will collect your IP address (the unique address which
        identifies your home computer on the internet) or the unique identifier
        (which is linked to your mobile device) which are automatically
        recognised by our servers. You cannot be identified solely from this
        information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective
        service on the App and to collect broad demographic information for
        aggregate use.
The website uses cookies to store certain information. Cookies are
        pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to
        store and sometimes track information about you. Although they do
        identify a user’s device, cookies do not personally identify users.
        Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be
        accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your
        movements around the internet.
Information Sharing
We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the App,
        customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective
        partners, advertisers, potential merchants and other reputable third
        parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include
        no personally identifiable information.
We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates,
        merchants, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing
        the services we offer through the App, processing transactions,
        fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending
        communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing
        support services or in other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and
        contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to
        perform their functions.
In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third
        party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be
        transferred to that re-organised entity or third party.
We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or
        if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber
        crime or to protect the App or enforce the terms under which you
        transact with us or enforce the rights, property or personal safety of
        any person.
Information deletion / Requesting deletion of your data

Public forums
The App may, from time to time, make public forums available to its
        users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public
        information and you should exercise caution when using these and never
        disclose your personal information.
External links
The App may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. We are
        not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.
Payment processing
Payment details you provide will be encrypted using industry standard
        128 bit secure sockets layer (SSL) technology before they are submitted
        to us or our payment partners over the internet. You will be providing
        credit or debit card information directly to the Payment Solutions
        Provider (PSP) which operates a secure server to process payment
        details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising
        payment. We do not store your credit card number or security code on our
        servers, though it may transit through our servers as it passes to PSP.
        Information which you supply to our PSP is not within our control and is
        subject to PSP’s own privacy policy and terms and conditions.
Marketing to you
We may send you information we think you may find useful or which you
        have requested from us by push notification and/or (if you provide us
        with your e-mail address) by e-mail, including information about the
        latest or upcoming events featured on the App, provided you have
        indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes
        and we will always give you the option to opt-out of receiving further
        e-mails or push notifications by following the unsubscribe instructions
        on any communications sent to you.
Additionally we may allow our merchants, and if you consent by opting-in
        to receive such information and offers, other carefully selected third
        parties, to send you information directly which you may find useful
        regarding their products and services.
You can tell us not to contact you with information regarding the
        products or services of third parties, or to share your details with
        third parties so that they can directly send you information regarding
        their products and services, either at the point such information is
        collected on the App (by checking the relevant box), or where you do not
        wish us to continue to use your information in this way by following the
        unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you.
You can also exercise this right at any time by contacting us using the
        contact details at the end of this privacy policy.
When you purchase a ticket from Kidzapp, you may at that time be offered
        an opportunity to purchase third party products or services or enter
        third party promotions or loyalty programmes. If you expressly consent
        to purchase those products or services or enter into the promotions or
        programmes you authorise us to share your name, e-mail address with that
        third party merchant. The use of your personal information will be
        governed by the terms of that merchant’s own terms of supply and privacy
        policy, so ensure that you read the relevant terms and privacy policy
        carefully before you agree to purchase from, or participate with that
        third party merchant.
‘All credit/debit cards’ details and personally identifiable
          information will NOT be stored, sold, shared, rented or leased to any
          third parties’’
‘’ Kidzapp LLC will not pass any debit/credit card details to third
          parties’’
Your location data
In order to get the most out of our service and to allow us to provide
        you with tailored offers, we need to process your approximate location
        from time to time. The types of location data that will be processed are
        your latitude, longitude, cell tower ID, etc. Your location data will
        only be processed for as long as necessary in order for us to respond to
        your request for tailored offers. After this the data will be deleted.
        The location data may be transferred to our merchants for the purpose of
        providing you with the best offers at that time to match your
        preferences.
You can choose not to allow us to process your approximate location at
        the time you connect to the app, or any time after that either by
        changing the settings on your mobile device or by contacting us using
        the contact details at the end of this privacy policy. Please note that
        if you choose not to allow us to process your location data, we will not
        have enough data in order to provide you with the full benefit of our
        service (e.g. a list of tailored offers matched to your approximate
        location).
Security
We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable
        information associated with our users. We have security measures in
        place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of
        personal information under our control. For example, our security and
        privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and
        only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we
        cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of
        information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent
        it.
You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet
        is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of
        information you submit via the App whilst it is in transit over the
        internet and any such submission is at your own risk.
Storage of your information
Information that you submit via the App is sent to and stored on secure
        servers. This is necessary in order to process the information.
        Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other
        offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances
        described above. By submitting information via the App, you agree to
        this storing, processing and/or transfer.
Kidzapp cookies policy
When you interact with the App, we try to make that experience simple
        and meaningful. When you visit our App our Web server sends a cookie to
        your computer or mobile device (depending on how you access the site).
        Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your
        computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track
        information about your use of the site. A number of cookies we use last
        only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your
        App. These are known as session cookies. Other cookies are used to
        remember you when you return to the App and will last for longer. These
        are known as persistent cookies.
We use cookies to:
Remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify
          the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure
          we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;
Customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the
          pages of the site; and
Collect statistical information about how you use the site so that we
          can improve the site and learn which parts of the website are most
          popular to visitors.
Some of the cookies used by our App are set by us, and some are set by
        third parties who are delivering services on our behalf. For example,
        social networking sites.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you
        can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a

In addition to cookies, tracking Gifs may be set by us or third parties
        in respect of your use of the site. Tracking Gifs are small image files

        third parties can understand what parts of the website are visited or
        whether particular content is of interest.
