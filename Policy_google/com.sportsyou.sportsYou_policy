You have arrived at
sportsYou.com
or are otherwise interacting with our Service (defined below), which is owned and operated by MMR Digital LLC (“sportsYou,” “we,” “our” or “us”). This “Privacy Policy” governs your access to and use of any of our branded online service locations (e.g., websites, Official Pages (defined below) or mobile app) or platforms that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (each a “Site” or “Website”), and also applies to your use of interactive features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, platform, software, downloads or other services that we own or control and make available through a Website, app or Official Page, software or that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service” or “Services”), regardless of how you access or use them, but does not apply to data we receive from third parties, unless we combine such data with Personal Information (defined below) that we have ourselves collected under this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below), and does not govern the data practices of third parties that may interact with our Service.
In addition, please review the User Terms of Use, which governs your use of the Service. By using our Service, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use and our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below.
‍
We have adopted this Privacy Policy to further the relationship between sportsYou and our subscribers. This statement of our Privacy Policy makes disclosures concerning our collection of information, including personal information, when you use the Website or Service, and how we use and disclose it to others. By using the Website or Service you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Pleases come back and review this Privacy Policy from time to time to see any changes and revisions we have made since your last visit.
COPPA.
We strive to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe experience using our Services. Parents or legal guardians can review any Personal Information collected about their child under 13 years of age, have this information deleted, request that there be no further collection or use of their child's Personal Information, or allow for our collection and use of their child's Personal Information while withholding consent for us to disclose it to third parties. We take steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent, legal guardian, teacher, coach or school official. Official Pages are administered by coaches, school officials or others responsible for team or school activities. These administrators have the power and authority to grant access to pages administered by them, restrict access to such pages and deny access to such pages, as they deem appropriate. The Official Page administrator is the first person to whom a parent should go if there is a concern about who has access to an Official Page upon which their child's information resides. We also strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when using our Services. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), which requires us to inform parents and legal guardians about our information collection and use practices. COPPA also requires that we obtain parental consent before we allow children under the age of 13 to access or use our Services or any Official Page. We require Official Page administrators to limit access to the Official Page for which the administrator has administration authority only to persons who are affiliated with the team or school. We urge Official Page administrators to impress upon kids and their parents the need to vet and consider carefully what is placed on an Official Page, and urge kids to check with their parents before entering information through our Website or Services. We recommend that parents discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of Personal Information (as defined below) to the public generally or to anyone they don't know.
‍
Access to the Website by you or by your child is available through a password and unique user name (customer ID) selected by you or the administrator of your team, league or school. This password is encrypted. We highly recommend that you do not divulge your or your child's name or password to anyone.
‍
Our Website and the services and products we offer and sell are intended for high school, college and university students, faculty members and professional and semi-professional players and fans of teams comprised of such persons. Therefore, it is unlikely that children under the age of 13 will use the Website themselves, or purchase any services or products we may offer. Accordingly, we will not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children that we know to be under the age of 13, although parents may choose to provide such information with respect to their children. In addition, we will delete any information in our database that we know originates from a child under the age of 13 unless we have obtained informed consent in compliance with COPPA.
We encourage you to carefully choose the information you upload or post on the Website, Services, or to any portion of the Website administered by your team, league, school or other authorized person (each an “Official Page”), or otherwise provide to others since any User Submissions (as defined below) may be accessible and viewable by administrators, persons with administrative privileges, school, league or team officials and by other registered users of the Official Page. The Website or Services may permit the submission and uploading of certain user-generated and administrator generated text, information, photos, data, audio files, videos, graphics, or other content (“User Submissions”) to an Official Page, the Services and the hosting, sharing, transmission or publishing of such User Submissions by an Administrator of the Official Page, team, school or league or by another registered user. For example, an authorized administrator of a league, team or school portion of the Official Page portion of the Website for his or her team, and a registered member or authorized user of such member may elect to upload, post, store and otherwise make available to other users on an Official Page or third parties, content created, owned or licensed by such user and other personal or professional information. We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Submissions online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to these User Submissions and may have the ability to share it with third parties with or without attribution. User Submissions may be published by us or others having access to the Official Page upon which the User Submission was first posted. User Submissions may be viewed by both general users and registered members of the Website or of any Official Page. You understand and acknowledge that we do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Submissions and that User Submissions downloaded by another User or administrator of an Official Page may be used by such person without his or her complying with this Privacy Policy. We do not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public or post on an Official Page, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such User Submissions or the information contained or linked to such User Submissions will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make available on the Service or what others do with information you share with them on the Service. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Submissions that you or anyone else discloses, posts, links or receives from third parties through the Service. We are not responsible for how any other person uses any User Submissions submitted by you or by others. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, we may only use the Video (as defined by the Organization Terms of Service) as prescribed in the Organization Terms of Service and User Terms of Use.
Information We Collect
Personal Information
We do not collect any personal information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. When you sign up to become a user of the Website or Services (a “User”), you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information, such as (a) your first name, last name, email address, home address, team, school or organization and (b) demographic information, such as information about your gender, age and educational level (“Demographic Information”). If you are under the age of 18, we may also request and collect Personal Information from your parent to verify age, relationship, and other items. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to this type of information as “Personal Information.” We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, from the teams, leagues, schools and other organizations with which you or your child are associated, and from registration forms, lists provided by administrators of Official Pages, “contact us” forms, e-mail subscription lists, blog comments, forums or when you otherwise interact with the Service. To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
‍
Please remember that when you or your child are tagged in a photo, the tag not only reveals that you or the child are in the photo, it also links to your profile and the event, and may have additional information concerning the place and date of the photo. This means anyone who has access to the photo can see who you or your child are and learn more about you or your child via the photo and your or your child's profile. While this can be fun, it also raises some privacy concerns.
‍
Other than the online contact information required to obtain parental consent, we do not collect any Personal Information from Users under the age of 13, or if prohibited by applicable law, under the age of 18, unless the User's parent or legal guardian has first provided us with consent for that User to use the Services and disclose Personal Information to us. If you are a User under the age of 13, or if you are a User under the age of 18 and applicable law does not permit you to access the Services without parental consent, please do not send any Personal Information to us if we have not obtained prior consent from your parent or guardian. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from a User under the age of 13, or under the age of 18 if applicable law requires parental consent to access the Services, without parental or guardian consent, or if we learn a User under the age of 13, or 18 if applicable law requires parental consent to access the Services, has provided to us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we  will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a User under the age of 13, or 18 if applicable law requires parental consent to access the Services, may have provided us Personal Information in violation of this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
privacy@sportsyou.com

Information Third Parties Provide About You
We may receive information about you, from your friends, teammates, leagues, coaches, school, colleagues and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on an Official Page on the Service (for example, when information is posted about your performance, a team, practice, game, “stats” or on a blog). Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with online identifiers, IP addresses, unique device numbers, other persistent identifiers, information provided by third parties (schools, leagues, coaches, parents, etc.) or from outside records from the internet, newspapers or third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.

Usage Information
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “Device”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat it as Personal Information. We may de-identify Usage Information in accordance with COPPA and use this de-identified information to develop, evaluate, and provide improved Services.
‍
We may use third-party services such as Google Analytics to better understand your online activity and provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you. You may exercise choices with respect to Google Analytics via the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on available at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
This Usage Information may include: your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier; your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information); the URL that referred you to our Service; the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences; your Device location; your Device characteristics; and certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.
Tracking Technologies.
We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“Tracking Technologies”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
‍
Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. You can reject cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet provider's “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Website, but may not be able to use some areas of the Website or the Services.
‍
Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Service's pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
‍
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
‍
Browser Fingerprinting. Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.
‍
ETag, or Entity Tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
Recognition Technologies.
Recognition Technologies. Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices in the same user).
‍
Tracking Technologies Usage. We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:
Strictly Necessary. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Service, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.
Performance Related. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Service, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.
Functionality Related.

Targeting Related.
We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content relevant to your interests on our Service and third party sites based on how you interact with our content; however, to the extent Usage Information collected via Tracking Technologies or otherwise is Personal Information, such Usage Information will not be used for targeted advertisement. This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content that has been delivered to you. Further information on this, and your opt-out choices, can be found in the discussion below. If you turn cookies off, some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not function properly.
Tracking Technologies Choices.
We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed. With respect to cookies you may be able to choose to have your device warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you may be able to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser settings. If you turn cookies off, some features of the Service may be disabled and the Service may not function properly. You can find more information about cookies at websites such as
www.allaboutcookies.org
.
We may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.
Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track.
There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. You consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Service and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties to the extent they are not under our control. Also, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, but may do so in the future.
‍
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's website www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of our Services may not work and that when you revisit our Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. Further, App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of the App) can only be disabled by uninstalling the App. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system, mobile device or handset manufacturer.
Social Media Features.
The Website includes social media features, such as a Twitter feed. Actions you take in connection with social media features may be reflected in a manner visible to others; for example, if you “Like” us on Facebook, others may be able to see that you have done so.

For example, we may receive basic Facebook account information (name, e-mail, gender, birthday, current city, and profile picture URL) through a Facebook page. Also, when you “like,” “subscribe to,” or send a “tweet” to us through a social media channel, we may receive your username, handle, and any other available personal information from the social media site or application. All information we receive from social media sites and applications is treated and used in the same manner and for the same purposes as described in this Policy with respect to similar information we obtain through the Site.
‍
Actions you take in connection with Social Media Sites may be reflected in a manner visible to others, for example, if you “Like” us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter, others may be able to see that you have done so.

‍
You acknowledge and agree that you do not have an expectation of privacy of any Personal Information and/or Usage Information for any of the matters for which we may use your Personal Information and/or Usage Information as set forth herein.
Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties
We may share information that is not your individual Personal Information, such as aggregated user statistics, or de-identified information with third parties. We may share your Device Identifiers with third parties along with data related to you and your activities subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We do not share your Personal Information that we have collected directly from you on our Service with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. We do not as a rule allow third-party operators to collect Personal Information or Usage Information through persistent identifiers on our Services for any purposes other than the internal operations of our Services. Further, we do not use Personal Information collected through our Services for the purpose of targeted advertising. If we de-identify data about you, it is not treated as Personal Information by us, and we may share it with others freely. For this purpose, de-identified data generally refers to data from which we have removed personally identifiable information—i.e., data about individual students, teams members, teachers, or administrators that has been rendered anonymous by stripping out any information that would allow people to determine an individual's identity, including first and last names, home addresses, telephone numbers, government issued ID numbers, and other types of information that may reveal whether or not inadvertently an individual's identity. We do this in an effort to protect the privacy or identity of the individuals associated with the data. In addition, we may share the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information to us and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your information as follows:
‍
(a) When You Request Information From or Provide Information to Third Parties. You may be presented with an option on our Service to receive certain information or marketing offers, or both, directly from third parties or to have us send certain information to third parties or give them access to it. If you choose to do so, your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed to such third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to the third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties. In addition, third parties may store, collect or otherwise have access to your information when you interact with their Tracking Technologies, content, tools apps or ads on our Service or link to them from our Service. This may include using third-party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or other third-party posting or content sharing tools and by so interacting you consent to such third party practices. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review such third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them.
‍
(b) Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of sportsYou or the Service, such as hosting the Service, designing and/or operating the Service's features, processing purchase orders, tracking the Service's activities and analytics, and enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them. However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available at the end of this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options.
‍
(c) To Protect the Rights of sportYou and Others. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of sportsYou, our owners, managers, officers or third parties (including through the enforcement of this Policy, our Terms of Use, and other applicable agreements and policies); or (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g., pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas, discovery demands or league, school, court or administrative agency orders). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we have complete discretion in electing to make or not make such disclosures, and to contest or not contest requests for such disclosures, all without notice to you.
‍
(d) Affiliates and Business Transfer. We may share your information, including your Device Identifiers and Personal Information, Demographic Information and Usage Information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates (“Affiliates”). We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process provided that any such successor will be subject to applicable laws with respect to previously acquired Personal Information.
‍
(e) Co-Branded Areas. Certain areas of the Service may be provided to you in association with third parties (“Co-Branded Areas”) such as sponsors, teams, schools, leagues, charities and political organizations and may require you to disclose Personal Information to them. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party and indicate if they have a privacy policy that applies to their collection and use of your information. Only if you elect to register for products or services, communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications, at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and to the third party. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Service, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Area.
‍
We are not responsible for such third party’s data collection or practices and you should look to such third parties' privacy policies for more information before you sign up for any third party Co-Branded Area services or products.
‍
(f) EEOC / Affirmative Action Reporting. In conjunction with laws and regulations enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“OFCCP”) and similar state and local regulatory agencies, we may ask you to provide us with self-identifying information (such as veteran status, age, gender and ethnicity). Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide us with such information, we may submit that information, to the EEOC, the OFCCP and similar state and local regulatory agencies or otherwise use or disclose it for business-related purposes, including, without limitation, responding to information requests, fulfilling regulatory reporting requirements and defending against employment related complaints.
‍
(g) Your California Privacy Rights. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to us, under certain circumstances, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this applies, you may obtain the categories of personal information shared and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2018 will receive information about 2017 sharing activities). To make such a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. You may make this request in writing at: MMR Digital LLC, 32 Frost Pond Road, PO Box 393, Mill Neck, NY 11765, ATTN: Privacy. Furthermore, if you are a California resident, school, or school affiliated team, sportsYou will comply with any applicable provisions of Sections 49073-49079.7 of the California Education Code with respect to use or disclosure of K-12 student records and the California Student Online Personal Information Protection Act, Ch. 22.2, §§ 22584 et seq. with respect to targeted advertising, selling student information, disclosing Personal Information and amassing profiles on K-12 students.
‍
(h) Like many businesses do, we sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments.
