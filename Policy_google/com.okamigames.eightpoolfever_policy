Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 20, 2025
General
Okami Games Ltd. (“Okami Games”, “we”, “our” or “us”) creates world-class, innovative, industry disrupting mobile games (“Games”) and applications (“Apps”). We further maintain
https://www.okamigames.io/,
its subdomains and related features (“Site”; and collectively with the Games and Apps, the “Services”).
We respect your privacy. In this Privacy Policy, we describe in a straightforward and transparent way how we collect, store, use and share your Personal Data. This policy applies to all our services.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and make sure you fully understand it and agree to it. If you do not, please stop using our Services.
Okami Games is a “data controller” under certain data protection laws. This means that we are responsible for deciding what Personal Data to ask of you, how to store and use it, and to explain our practices and reasons behind them, which we are about to do below. We wish to emphasize that you are not required to provide us with any Personal Data, but to also let you know that without it you may not be able to enjoy the full extent of our Services. For example, if you sign-in using guest mode, rather than via a third-party service provider account (such as Facebook or Google), we have no way of knowing that it is you on a new mobile device. It means that your game progress, including in-app purchases, would be tied to the mobile device with which they were made.  If so, you would not be able to pick up the game from the point you reached on one device using another, and that all your game information will be lost should your device get lost, stolen, or its data wiped out for any reason.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check it out periodically. If we revise it materially, we will notify you (“You”, or the “User”) by means such as posting a notice on our Games or by other means and take any additional steps required by applicable laws. Each time you access our Services, you manifest your assent to our then-current Privacy Policy and to our Terms of Use.

We collect your messages and requests. We also collect your usage pattern of the App and the Game (e.g., your wins). In case you make in-app purchases, we collect your purchase history and payment details (we do not process payments by ourselves).

This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your device, browser type and language, geo-location information, hardware type, operating system, internet service provider and other information about actions taken while using the Apps.
(ii)    We process information for the following purposes:
a.    To provide you with the Games, the Apps and their Full Features. We will use the information, including, without limitation, for the following purposes: (i) to allow you the convenience of logging-in by using an account you already have with a third-party service provider; (ii) to allow you a way to identify yourself uniquely while accessing the Service from different mobile (and non-mobile) devices, so you can pick up the game on a new mobile device from the point you previously left off playing on a different device; (iii) to process your requests; (iv) to communicate with you about your use of the Apps and for support purposes; (v) to fulfill any instruction and/or request made by you in the context of the Apps; (vi) to send you push notifications and/or emails and notifications regarding your account or certain features of the Apps, including: updates regarding the availability of new game versions, updates about new games and new game features available, and updates to our Privacy Policy and to the Terms of Use; (vii) to personalize and customize your experience with our App; and (viii) to generally administer and improve the Apps and Games.
b.    For Administrative Purposes. Okami Games may use your information (i) to respond to your questions, comments, and other requests for customer support, or information, including information about potential or future services; (ii) for internal quality control purposes; (iii) to establish a business relationship; and (iv) to generally administer Okami Games Apps.
c.    To Market our Apps. Okami Games may use information to market the company and the Apps. Such use includes (i) notifying you about offers and services that may be of interest to you; (ii) tailoring content, advertisements, and offers for you, including, targeting and re-targeting practices; (iii) conducting market research; (iv) developing and marketing new products and services, and to measure interest in Okami Games' services; (v) other purposes disclosed at the time you provide information; and (vi) as you otherwise consent.

Information may also be used to comply with applicable laws, with investigations performed by the relevant authorities, law enforcement purposes, and/or to exercise or defend legal claims.
e.    De-identified and Aggregated Information Use. In certain cases, we may or will anonymize or de-identify your Information and further use it for internal and external purposes, including, without limitation, to analyze and improve Okami Games products and services (including through the use of artificial intelligence) and for research purposes. We may use this anonymized or de-identified information and/or disclose it to third parties without restrictions (for example, in order to improve our services, the Apps and enhance your experience with them and/or to develop new product features and improve existing offerings).
f.    Technologies. We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Apps, may use Technologies to automatically collect information through the Apps. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your device that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with the Apps.
2.    HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
2.1.    Security. We have implemented and maintain reasonable technical, organizational and security measures designed to protect your information. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be compromised as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers. As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer, device or network you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your information. Note that we have no access to, and thus do not store, any passwords of yours. We only see the user ID, or email, with which you log-in via third party service providers (if you choose to log-in this way). Please make sure to take appropriate measures to protect your information.
2.2.    Retention of your information. Your information will be stored until we delete our records and we proactively delete it, or if you send a valid deletion request through our support page at
