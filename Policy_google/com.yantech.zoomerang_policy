Terms
Please read these Terms of Service and our Privacy PrivacyPolicy (collectively, the "Agreement") carefully before using the Zoomerang application software, website (collectively our “App”) provided by Zoomerang Inc A.S. (ZOOMERANG, "we," or " us"). By using our App, you agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you shouldn't and aren't permitted to use the App. ZOOMERANG reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to the terms of the Agreement. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who download, access or use the App (“Users").
There is no age limitation for using the Zoomerang application, but you must be of legally minimum age (13 years in USA) to create an account on Zoomerang.
Zoomerang App
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the App. This license includes both your personal, private, public use and your commercial use, as long as such use is in accordance with the features of the App as marketed by ZOOMERANG. ZOOMERANG reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the App and the ZOOMERANG IP (as defined below). ZOOMERANG may terminate or suspend this license at any time for any reason or no reason.
Commercial Use
Users, and third parties acting with the user’s consent, are permitted to use content generated from the App for commercial purposes, under the condition that they possess the necessary commercial rights to any original content that has been edited or modified using the App. Users are not required to provide proof of these rights, but by using the App, they agree that they have these rights.
However, all such commercial use must adhere strictly to the terms and conditions outlined in this Agreement. Moreover, use of the generated content on other platforms should be in accordance with those platforms’ respective terms and conditions. It is the responsibility of the user to understand and comply with these requirements.
Failure to abide by these terms could result in the revocation of your permission to use the content for commercial purposes. This policy aims to ensure that the content generated from the App is used ethically and legally, protecting the rights of all involved parties.
Zoomerang Accounts
Your Zoomerang account gives you access to the App and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Zoomerang with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.
You may never use another User’s account without permission, allow others to use your account or transfer your account to others. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify ZOOMERANG immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. ZOOMERANG will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the Application Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.
Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).
Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.
Termination. This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.
External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.
NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List.

You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons.

Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.
Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this Agreement and the relationship between you and Apple shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You and Apple agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, to resolve any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement. If (a) you are not a U.S. citizen; ( b) you do not reside in the U.S.; (c) you are not accessing the Service from the U.S.; and (d) you are a citizen of one of the countries identified below, you hereby agree that any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable law set forth below, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the state, province or country identified below whose law governs:
If you are a citizen of any European Union country or Switzerland, Norway or Iceland, the governing law and forum shall be the laws and courts of your usual place of residence.
Specifically excluded from application to this Agreement is that law known as the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.
Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless ZOOMERANG and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the App, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or Intellectual Property Rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your User Content, including without limitation any User Content, or any that is created, stored, shared or submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party’s access and use of the App with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.

Retention and Deletion of Your Data
European Union and UK Privacy Rights
If you reside in the UK or another European Union member state, you have certain rights under applicable data protection legislation. You can ask us to:
Confirm we process your personal data, and ask what personal data we have about you.
Change or fix your data.
Delete your data.
Stop using some or all of your data if we have no legal right to keep using it.
Give you a copy of the personal data you provided to us, in machine-readable format.
To exercise any of these rights, including to delete your data, please send your request to
support@zoomerang.app
. You must use "Request to Know Information", "Right to Know Categories," "Right to Delete," or "Right on Opt out of Sale/Sharing" or "Right to Correct Information" in the subject line of your email, as appropriate. You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you think we haven’t complied with applicable data protection laws, you also have a right to file a complaint with your local data protection authority.
The data controller for Zoomerang’s website and services is Zoomerang, Inc., a Delaware company with its registered office at 2035 Sunset Lake Road, Suite B-2, Newark, 19702, New Castle County. Our data protection officer may be reached at
support@zoomerang.app
.
To verify your identity when you make a request, you must provide us with your email address, full name and respond to an email verification request. We will match that information to the information we have in our systems.
Because Zoomerang is a worldwide service, we may transfer the personal data of EU residents to a country outside of the EU and the UK. When we do, we do so under the EU’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (known as "standard contractual clauses").
When you register for an account, we process and retain most personal information we have about you for as long as you are a user of our services. When you close your account, we begin deleting certain personal information that we no longer have a business reason to retain. We may be required to retain certain information about you, such as when there is a legal requirement to do so.
US State Privacy Rights
If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the following rights under the applicable privacy laws in your state ("State Privacy Laws"):
The right to know what personal information we have collected about you, including sources, the purpose of collection, and third parties we have shared it with.
The right to delete your personal information.
The right to share or sell your information with any third party.
To exercise any of these rights, including to delete your personal information, please submit your request to
support@zoomerang.app
. You must use "Request to Know Information", "Right to Know Categories", "Right to Delete," or "Right on Opt out of Sale/Sharing" or "Right to Correct Information" in the subject line of your email, as appropriate. For requests to know, delete and correct, you must provide us with your first name, last name, and the email address you used when you created your Zoomerang account, if applicable. Each request must be sent separately.
To fulfill your requests, we must be able to verify your identity in our systems against the identity you provide. You’ll need to provide us with your email address and respond to an email verification request, so we can match that information to the information we have in our systems.
We will process your request in an efficient manner, but we may not be able to delete your personal information (i) if we have to complete an ongoing transaction with you, (ii) if we detect or need to address a data security incident, if we need to preserve the integrity or security of our systems, or if we need to investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for any such action, (iii) in order to correct or repair an error, (iv) in order to protect against harassment or malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, (v) in order to comply with a legal requirement or to assist another party with any of its legal obligations under applicable privacy laws, or (vi) if we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as if we use it internally in a lawful manner to improve our services or to communicate with you about your account. We will also maintain a record of your requests. If we delete your personal information, many of our services will not work the same for you. For example, your previous opt-out requests will not be saved, your account will be deleted, any edited photos, videos, or other media will be deleted, and saved preferences and information will no longer be available.
Do Not Sell or Share/Use My Personal Information for Targeted Advertising
Residents in states with State Privacy Laws can opt-out of both sales of their personal information and the use of their information for targeted advertising (known as "sharing" in California). "Sale" includes most circumstances in which a business makes personal information available to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. In California "sharing" includes circumstances in which a business makes personal information available to a third party specifically for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising (also known as retargeting or interest-based advertising across platforms), even if no money is exchanged. Thus, when we use the term "share" under this section, we are using it in the narrow meaning of how it is defined under California law. Other State Privacy Laws do not use the term "share," but describe the activity as using personal information for targeted advertising.
Through our participation in digital advertising networks to deliver advertising tailored to your interests, we may sell or share/use for targeted advertising the following categories of personal information: identifiers, internet and electronic activity and commercial information. You can opt-out of us selling or sharing/using your personal information for targeted advertising for online activity by emailing us at
support@zoomerang.app
to submit your request.
California users under the age of 18 may request the removal of their content publicly posted in our services by emailing us at
support@zoomerang.app
. You will need to describe the content you want removed in enough detail to allow us to locate it, or we may not be able to process your request. In some cases, complete removal of your content may not be possible because your content may have been reposted (in whole or in part) by other users. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under the age of 16.
Right to Appeal
If you are a Colorado, Connecticut or Virginia resident and we were unable to fulfill your request, you may appeal by emailing us at
support@zoomerang.app
within fourteen days of our decision and submitting an appeal request with a detailed reason for your appeal, as well as your state of residence.
Sensitive Personal Information
We do not collect or process Sensitive Personal Information, as defined by California Law, for inferring characteristics or use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those permitted by law. In addition, we do not "sell" or "share" Sensitive Personal Information, as "sell" and "share" are defined above in the "Do Not Sell or Share/Use My Personal Information for Targeted Advertising" section.
Retention
We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.
