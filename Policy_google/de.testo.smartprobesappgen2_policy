We take the protection of your entered data and thus your privacy very seriously. In order to guarantee the greatest possible protection of your privacy, it goes without saying that we comply with all legal provisions on data protection. In the following we would like to inform you about which personal data we at Testo can collect during the use of the apps and for what purpose they are used.

If you have any questions about data protection in connection with our products or the use of our apps, you can also contact our data protection officer at any time. This can be contacted at the above postal address and at the e-mail address previously provided (keyword: "Data Protection Officer").
2. Data processing on our app
2.1. Collection, processing and use of personal data
The following personal data can be processed when using our apps:
> Contact details of yourself and your customers (name, first name, address, telephone number, fax number, mobile number, e-mail address)
> Pictures selected by you
> Your location data
All apps except the Saveris Installation App provide the ability to record the measurement data measured by our instrument, process it for reporting, generate the report itself and integrate the measurement data and other data into the report. All data retrieved from your mobile device and its use are used exclusively for creating reports. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.
The Saveris Installation App guides you through the installation of the Testo Saveris devices and gives Testo employees the ability to create an acceptance report. In this report the name, email address, and signature of the Testo employee are processed, as well as the name, installation site address, and customer email addresses of the customer. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.
2.2. Making contact
There are several ways to contact us. This includes the contact form on our website, the telephone hotline and contacting us by e-mail. In this context we process data exclusively for the purpose of communication with you. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. The data collected by us when using the contact form will be automatically deleted after complete processing of your request, unless we still need your request to fulfil contractual or legal obligations (see section "Storage period").
2.3. Inclusion of your contacts and pictures in the report
(does not apply for Saveris Installation App)
You have the possibility to insert your contact data and pictures into the report. The apps actively access your personal data (name, first name, address) from your contact directory or pictures from your photo gallery after you have selected the contacts in advance. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.
All the data/pictures you select and paste into the report are simply copied from the location of your mobile device into the report.
2.4. Use of your location data
(does not apply for Saveris Installation App)
For the communication of our measuring device with measuring probes/other devices via Bluetooth it may be necessary to record your location data. You must therefore activate the location service in your device. This access to your location data is only required for Bluetooth communication functionality. We will not use or store your location information for any other purpose.
2.5 Data processing in case of app crashes
Description and scope
To improve the stability and reliability of our apps, we rely on crash reports from our users. Such crash reports contain anonymous technical information that helps us to reproduce the crash and understand its cause so that we can fix it in one of our next app versions.
Your IP address is processed to transmit this data. There is no storage of your IP address or processing for other purposes.
Purpose
The crash information is processed to analyse the crashes in order to improve the stability and reliability of the apps. The processing of your IP address is used to transmit the crash reports.
Legal basis
The legal basis for the processing of the data transmitted in the course of a crash report transmission is Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest is to improve the stability and reliability of the apps, to avoid crashes and thus to improve the user experience.
Option to object
You can object to the processing of crash information at any time by deactivating the transmission in the app settings.

2.9 Analysis of usage behavior
Description and scope
Certain actions performed by the user are logged and transmitted in order to give us the opportunity to develop a better understanding of how end users use the individual functions. Examples of this are: The creation of a report generated as a CSV or PDF, the use of a specific measurement program (volume flow, tightness tests, ...) or individual button clicks. No personal data that you enter into the app is transmitted for this.
Purpose

3. Information disclosure
For the analysis of app crashes, we use Sentry, a service of Functional Software, Inc., 45 Fremont Street, 8th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA. The processing of the anonymous crash information takes place in the USA.
To protect your personal data, we use a so-called relay server, which prevents the transmission of your IP address to the USA. This relay server is hosted within the EU by our service provider Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg.
You can find more information about the relay under Relay
Relay
4. Storage Period
In principle, we store personal data only as long as this is required for the fulfilment of contractual or legal obligations which are the reason for the collection of the data. After that, we delete the data immediately, unless we require the data until the expiry of the legal limitation periods for the purposes of evidence in civil claims or due to statutory retention requirements.
Your photos and contact information in the reports will not be stored.
In addition, our apps can also write to your SD card / location if desired. This allows you to save your actively selected data (measurements, reports, pictures, other data) to the SD card / location.
The IP address is only processed for data transmission. Any further processing and in particular storage does not take place.
5. Your data protection rights
You have the right at any time to request information on the processing of your personal data by us. We will explain the data processing to you within the course of providing this information and furnish you with an overview of your stored personal data.
If data stored by us should be incorrect or no longer up-to-date, you have the right for this data to be corrected.
You can also request the deletion of your data. Should the deletion exceptionally not be possible due to other legal provisions, then the data is blocked, so that it is only available for this legal purpose.
Furthermore, you can restrict the processing of your data, e.g. if you are of the opinion that the data stored by us is not correct. You also have the right to data portability, in other words, upon your request, we forward a digital copy to you, containing the personal data that you have provided.
In order to assert the rights described here, you may contact us at any time, via the above-mentioned contact details. This also applies if you wish to receive copies of guarantees for evidence of a reasonable level of data protection.
Furthermore, you have the right to object to the data processing, which is based on Art. 6, Para. 1 e or f GDPR. Finally, you have the right to lodge a complaint at the data protection supervisory authority responsible for us. You can exercise this right at a supervisory authority in the member state of your residence, your employment or the place of the suspected breach. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, the competent supervisory authority is: Der Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit Baden-Württemberg, Postfach 10 29 32, 70025 Stuttgart, Lautenschlagerstraße 20, 70173 Stuttgart.
6. Right of revocation and objection
You have the right, in accordance with Article 7, Para. 3 GDPR, to revoke consent once granted to us, at any time. As a consequence, we shall in future no longer continue to process the data that is the object of the consent. The revocation of the consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent up to the time of the revocation.
Insofar as we are processing your data on the basis of legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6, Para. 1, Sentence 1 f GDPR, you have the right in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR, to raise an objection against the processing of your data, insofar as there are grounds for this, which arise from your special situation or where the objection is directed against direct advertising. In the latter case, you have a general right of objection, which we shall implement also without the need for you to give reasons.
If you wish to use your right to revoke or your right of objection, an informal notification to the above-mentioned contacts is sufficient.
7. Data security
We maintain current technical measures to safeguard data security, in particular for the protection of your personal data against risks during data transmissions as well as against third parties acquiring knowledge of your personal data. These are correspondingly adjusted to the current state of the art. To secure the personal data specified by yourself on our website, we use Transport Layer Security (TLS) which encrypts the information you enter.
8. Amendment of the Privacy Statement
We occasionally update this Privacy Statement, for example when we are adjusting our website or if the legal or official requirements change.
