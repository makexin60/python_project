By using our app(s), you agree that the legal information contained in the app(s) is provided to you as a resource for information and does not constitute legal advice. Legal advice is the application of law to an individual's specific circumstances.
By using our app(s), you agree that we make no claims, promises or guarantees about the accuracy, completeness, or adequacy of the information contained in, linked to, or referenced in our app(s), our servers, or our affiliated web sites and their servers. You understand that you should utilize other services including court or state websites to view the actual cases, statutes, or other legal information.
You understand that the law changes very rapidly and, accordingly, we do not guarantee that any information in our app(s), our servers, or our affiliated web sites and their servers is accurate and up to date. Additionally, you understand the law differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is subject to interpretation of courts of each locale. Legal advice must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each case and the tools and information provided to you may not be an appropriate fit in your case. You further agree and understand that nothing that you read or is provided within our app(s), our servers, or our affiliated web sites and their servers should be used as a substitute for the advice of competent legal counsel.
Users agree to contact the developer to report any application issues before posting a disparaging review. After such contact, if the problem is not isolated to the user’s device, the developer has 14 days to deliver a new application version to fix the reported issue. Users agree to not post any disparaging reviews within this 14 day timeframe upon the user’s initial communication with the developer. If the developer fails to fix an application problem within 14 days, the developer agrees to allow users to review the application. If, and when, the developer fixes an application problem that resulted in a users posting a disparaging review (after the initial 14 days), the user agrees to remove their review as it is no longer valid. Users agree to not post any disparaging comments if the application problem is isolated to a user’s specific device. The developer agrees to review submitted crash reports, review other user communications and test the application on the same or similar device the reporting user possesses in an effort to reproduce the reported problem before determining whether or not the reported issue is isolated to the user’s device and not a wide-spread bug affecting other users requiring immediate attention. Users agree to report grammatical and spelling errors to the developer. Users cannot review an app solely based on grammatical or spelling errors and must allow the developer until the next application version to fix any reported errors. The developer has no obligation to produce an application update within the aforementioned 14 day time period to fix grammatical or spelling errors. The developer notes this paragraph falls on the principle that he cannot be expected to fix what has not reported as broke.
