As described in more detail below, we may collect the following categories of information about you or your use of Lumosity: (1) identifiers (such as name and email address); (2) commercial information (such as transaction data); (3) financial data (such as payment information); (4) internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or app usage); (5) geolocation information (e.g. general location inferred from an IP address); (6) sensory information (such as audio or video recordings during research programs or through your use of Figment); (7) professional or employment related data; (8) education data; (9) inference data about you; (10) legally protected classifications (such as gender); (11) medical information (such as information you voluntarily provide to us in a survey); (12) physical characteristics or description; and (13) other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.
We may collect information from you in a variety of ways, such as when you:
Register for a Lumosity account (“Account”);
Request certain features (e.g. newsletters);
Fill out a survey or provide us with feedback;
Play cognitive training games or engage in other activities that require your information to function (e.g., portions of Lumosity that require an Account to participate);
Apply for a job with us;
Communicate with us; or
Post user-generated content to Lumosity.
You are not required to create an Account to gain access to some areas of Lumosity. If you do create an Account, we ask for certain information to process your registration, including an email address and password. If you subscribe to a paid Account, we request additional information, including your full name and payment method details.
We may also collect (1) name, (2) gender, (3) date of birth, (4) education level, (5) other demographic information, and (6) other information you voluntarily provide to us. Providing most of this information is optional. We also allow you select your preferences for training, language, and receiving email communications.
In addition to the information you provide directly to us, when you use Lumosity, we automatically collect information about the computer, mobile device, or other devices you use to access Lumosity and about how you use Lumosity. For example, we receive data about the games you play and your performance in those games. We also receive information such as your browser type, IP address, language, the type of device you use, operating system version, unique device identifier ("UDID"), the date and time of your visit and files you viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), Internet service provider, clickstream data, the pages you view and the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting Lumosity. In some cases, we link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services and marketing we offer you.
We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices or tablets) you use to access Lumosity. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information such as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information (including general location inferred from IP addresses), unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, and other information about your computer or device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, mobile device carrier information, the state or country from which you accessed Lumosity; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with Lumosity, such as: referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, statistical information about the use of Lumosity, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used Lumosity, the frequency of your use of Lumosity, error logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.
Like many other companies, we and third parties that we work with use cookies and other web and mobile tracking technologies, like HTML5, web beacons, scripts, pixels, server logs, and tags. We use these technologies for authentication, to store your preferences or progress, for analytics, and to help us advertise Lumosity. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of Lumosity you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of Lumosity and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,
Internet Explorer
;
Google Chrome
;
Mozilla Firefox
; or
Apple Safari
). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at
Adobe's website
. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of Lumosity.
We may supplement the information you provide to us with additional information gathered from other sources, such as publicly available information, or from third parties, such as marketers, partners, researchers and others. We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other product or service we provide.
If you sign in to Lumosity using your Facebook or other third party credentials, we will use that service to authenticate you. We may also receive other information that you have agreed may be provided by that third party, such as your username, name, e-mail address, photo, location, date of birth, gender, an ID associated with the applicable third party platform, user files like photos and videos, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes." We receive this information so that it can be used for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to have this information shared by these third parties, do not use Facebook or another third party to access Lumosity. We may also collect other information through other social networks that you make available to us. For a description on how social networking and other third party sites handle and share your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings. We may combine information that we collect from or about you with information about you that we obtain from such social media and other content platforms and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.
If you are a subject in a research project or study conducted by Lumos Labs in partnership with a researcher or educational institution, that project may involve the collection of different information than is described in this Section. Research participants may, for example, provide health-related information, including the existence of certain health conditions. Lumos Labs partners with researchers and educational institutions in conducting such studies. Such research projects are typically done on an anonymous basis, such that Lumos Labs acts only as a processor of anonymized or pseudononymized data. For further information on how we handle data associated with such research, please refer to the materials distributed to you as part of the study, contact the researcher leading your study, or contact us using the contact information below.
We use the categories of information identified above to operate and provide you with Lumosity and other services. This includes, but is not limited to the following business and commercial purposes:
For the purposes for which you provided it;
Authenticating your login and processing your payments;
Personalizing your Lumosity experience and customizing your training program;
Allowing you to monitor your performance and progress in Lumosity, by, for example, presenting charts and graphs of your performance to you;
Customizing and delivering information about our products and services by email;
To contact you with information, surveys, or advertising that we believe may be of interest to you regarding us or Lumosity;
To administer contests and surveys;
Providing customer support and sending confirmations about your Account;
For internal research and reporting;
Protecting our intellectual property or other rights; and
Managing and improving our business, our games, and our training.
We also reserve the right to use and disclose non-personal data (e.g., de-identified or aggregate data) for any purpose. For example, we show aggregate performance measures to users to allow them to evaluate their performance against other Lumosity users. Also, in connection with our Human Cognition Project, we may disclose performance statistics to university collaborators to evaluate, study, and improve the effectiveness of our programs or human cognition more generally. In these situations, all data is disclosed either in aggregate form or with information that can identify you removed. In addition, when we work with university collaborators, we contractually prohibit them from attempting to re-identify individuals from data that has been de-identified.
We also use reCAPTCHA v.3 feature of Google to determine whether inputs are made by a natural person or by potentially abusive automated tools (bots). reCAPTCHA uses data such as IP address and activity patterns (e.g., typing/mouse movements) to make such determination. reCAPTCHA is subject to Google’s
Terms of Service
and
Privacy Policy
.
The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them. For example, we handle personal data on this basis for our premium users.
Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent. Where you have provided consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out prior to withdrawing your consent. To withdraw your consent, please contact us at legal@lumoslabs.com.
Legitimate interests: In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as:
Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;
Customer service;
Marketing;
Protecting our users, personnel, and property;
Analyzing and improving our business;
Processing job applications; and
Managing legal issues.
We may also process personal data for the legitimate interests of our research partners, such as to provide cognitive training, research, and analytics for such partners.
Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
To protect the vital interests of the individual or others: For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent safety situation.
We believe in protecting your privacy, and therefore do not provide your personal data to third parties for their own marketing purposes.
We may share the categories of personal information identified in Section 1 for business purposes (as defined by applicable law) or as required by applicable law. More specifically, we may share your personal information in the following situations:
We may share your information with certain third parties selected by us to help support our operations. These include, for example, services that help us process payments, analyze web traffic, send emails, and track customer support requests. In addition, we may share limited personal data to third parties that help us market or advertise Lumosity. These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and we contractually require them to protect your information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
We may share your information with our corporate affiliates, such as entities under common ownership or control.
We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection with an actual or contemplated merger, reorganization, business transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such scenarios, your information may be one of the assets transferred. We will post a notice or otherwise notify you and collect your consent, as may be required by law, before the information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief we are required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal mechanism. We may also disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure may prevent fraud and abuse of Lumosity or its users or protect our property rights.
We may disclose your information when we believe we have your consent to do so, such as when you contact customer support and ask us about your Account, or when we have the consent of someone we believe is authorized to consent on behalf of you, such as the individual associated with the payment method for your Account, or where you share user-generated content with other Lumosity users or publicly. If you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal data collected by Lumosity, we also may disclose your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented.
We may use third-party web analytics services on Lumosity, such as those of Google Analytics, Rollbar, and New Relic. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the "Cookies and other electronic technologies" section to help us analyze how users use Lumosity, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, how often you use our app, the events that occur within our app, where the app was downloaded from, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of Lumosity. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking
here
.
If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications.
We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using Lumosity through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our websites, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via Lumosity may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of Lumosity in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of Lumosity. We also may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and others) to serve tailored ads to you on Lumosity, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access Lumosity. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access Lumosity by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link
or the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link
to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the
Google Ads Settings page
. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into Lumosity, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Account Review
You may access, review, correct, and delete certain of your personal data by logging into your Account.
Analytics and Advertising
You also can exercise certain opt-out rights by following the instructions at the end of the "Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising" section above.
Your Legal Rights
In addition, individuals in the European Union and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to request that we:
confirm whether we hold personal data about them,
provide access to personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form),
update, amend and/or correct personal data we hold;
delete certain personal data in appropriate circumstances;
transfer personal data to a third party provider of services;
To exercise any of the above rights (or any other rights under applicable law), please contact us via our
help center
.
In addition, individuals in the European Union and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances. They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data or exercise legal rights to withdraw consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. To exercise any of the above rights (or any other rights under applicable law), please contact us via our
help center
.
The rights described herein are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law. In situations in which we process personal data on behalf of our research partners, we may refer the request to the relevant research partner and cooperate with their handling of the request, subject to any special contractual arrangement with that research partner.
In addition to the rights above, residents of the European Economic Area also have the right to lodge a complaint with your relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.
Marketing
You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by navigating to your Email Notifications page or by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each email. Please note you may not opt out of certain transactional emails, such as when we email you to confirm transactions, address Account issues, or communicate about customer support.
Push Notifications
From time to time, we use push notifications in our mobile applications to send you messages about Lumosity or your Account. You may opt out from receiving push notifications through your device settings.
California Rights
California residents have certain rights, subject to exceptions. California law may permit you to request that we:
Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
Delete certain information we have about you.
You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide our services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use Lumosity.
You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
If would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request via our
help center
or
webform
. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity.
The CCPA requires us to disclose the categories of “third parties” (as defined by the CCPA) to whom personal information was disclosed or sold. In the preceding 12 months, we may have disclosed user-generated content, such as where you share user-generated content with other Lumosity users or publicly. If you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal data collected by Lumosity, we also may have disclosed your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented. Please review the section above on “When We Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties” for more details on how Lumosity generally shares information collected.
California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. Lumosity does not “sell” your personal information as we understand that term to be defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations.
Nevada Rights
Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law via our via our
help center
. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.
We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.
We have implemented and maintain security practices to protect against the unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of your personal data. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we therefore cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, please contact us using the contact information below.
If you access Lumosity outside of the United States, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of your personal data to, and the collection and processing of such personal data in the United States. The recipients of the personal data disclosures described in the "When We Share Your Personal Data with Third Parties" section above may be located in the United States or elsewhere in the world. Privacy laws in these countries may not provide protections equivalent to those of your country of residence, and your government may or may not deem such protections adequate.
Our website includes links to other sites that may collect personal data, and whose privacy practices may differ from those of Lumos Labs. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.
Our website offers publicly accessible blogs. Some blog posts allow comments via Facebook. You may need to login or contact Facebook both to post comments and to delete personal data that previously was posted in the comments. You can review Facebook’s privacy policy at this link:
https://www.facebook.com/policy.php
.
We allow you to refer your friends and contacts to Lumosity, either by manually entering their email addresses or by importing contacts from email accounts you have with third parties. If you choose to utilize these features, we’ll use and store the email addresses only for purposes of sending the invitation emails you have requested. If you utilize these features, the friends or contacts that you refer may contact us at the contact information listed below to request that we delete their personal data. Please note that we do not collect the username and password to your email accounts; the import features route you to the third party email provider to log in through their services.
Our website may include social media features, such as Facebook and Twitter buttons. Such features may collect your IP address and information about the page you are visiting, and may set cookies to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the company providing them.
On 10 July 2023, the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”) entered into force, followed by the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) on 17 July 2023 and the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF on 12 October 2023.

Complaints
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Lumos Labs commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.

Lumosity is not directed to individuals under 13 years old. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13, children under the age of 14 in Spain or South Korea, or from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as required by law. As appropriate under applicable law, parents or legal guardians with questions or requests regarding their children’s personal data may contact us as described below.
We do not track our customers’ personal data over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore do not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals.
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice to you either by email, by posting a notification on Lumosity or by posting an updated privacy policy on Lumosity 45 days in advance of the effective date of the updated Privacy Policy.

Lumos Labs, Inc. ("Lumos Labs," "our," "us," or "we") knows your privacy is important to you, and we are committed to providing a safe and secure user experience. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Lumosity Terms of Service, and describes the personal information we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it, including for information collected through the use of (1) Lumosity online at Lumosity.com, (2) Lumosity online on mobile devices, and (3) any other services that include a link to and/or copy of this Privacy Policy on the home page of the applicable website or similar location (e.g., a settings page) for any applicable mobile applications (collectively, "Lumosity"), which are owned and operated Lumos Labs. It describes how we collect, use, secure, and share information of our users and individuals whose payment details are used to purchase Lumosity (collectively, "you" or "your").

As described in more detail below, we may collect the following categories of information about you or your use of Lumosity: (1) identifiers (such as name and email address); (2) commercial information (such as transaction data); (3) financial data (such as payment information); (4) internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or app usage); (5) geolocation information (e.g. general location inferred from an IP address); (6) sensory information (such as audio or video recordings during research programs or through your use of Figment); (7) professional or employment related data; (8) education data; (9) inference data about you; (10) legally protected classifications (such as gender); (11) medical information (such as information you voluntarily provide to us in a survey); (12) physical characteristics or description; and (13) other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.
We may collect information from you in a variety of ways, such as when you:
Register for a Lumosity account (“Account”);
Request certain features (e.g. newsletters);
Fill out a survey or provide us with feedback;
Play cognitive training games or engage in other activities that require your information to function (e.g., portions of Lumosity that require an Account to participate);
Apply for a job with us;
Communicate with us; or
Post user-generated content to Lumosity.
You are not required to create an Account to gain access to some areas of Lumosity. If you do create an Account, we ask for certain information to process your registration, including an email address and password. If you subscribe to a paid Account, we request additional information, including your full name and payment method details.
We may also collect (1) name, (2) gender, (3) date of birth, (4) education level, (5) other demographic information, and (6) other information you voluntarily provide to us. Providing most of this information is optional. We also allow you select your preferences for training, language, and receiving email communications.
In addition to the information you provide directly to us, when you use Lumosity, we automatically collect information about the computer, mobile device, or other devices you use to access Lumosity and about how you use Lumosity. For example, we receive data about the games you play and your performance in those games. We also receive information such as your browser type, IP address, language, the type of device you use, operating system version, unique device identifier ("UDID"), the date and time of your visit and files you viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), Internet service provider, clickstream data, the pages you view and the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting Lumosity. In some cases, we link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services and marketing we offer you.
We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices or tablets) you use to access Lumosity. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information such as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information (including general location inferred from IP addresses), unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, and other information about your computer or device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, mobile device carrier information, the state or country from which you accessed Lumosity; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with Lumosity, such as: referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, statistical information about the use of Lumosity, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used Lumosity, the frequency of your use of Lumosity, error logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.
Like many other companies, we and third parties that we work with use cookies and other web and mobile tracking technologies, like HTML5, web beacons, scripts, pixels, server logs, and tags. We use these technologies for authentication, to store your preferences or progress, for analytics, and to help us advertise Lumosity. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of Lumosity you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of Lumosity and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g.,
Internet Explorer
;
Google Chrome
;
Mozilla Firefox
; or
Apple Safari
). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at
Adobe's website
. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of Lumosity.
We may supplement the information you provide to us with additional information gathered from other sources, such as publicly available information, or from third parties, such as marketers, partners, researchers and others. We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other product or service we provide.
If you sign in to Lumosity using your Facebook or other third party credentials, we will use that service to authenticate you. We may also receive other information that you have agreed may be provided by that third party, such as your username, name, e-mail address, photo, location, date of birth, gender, an ID associated with the applicable third party platform, user files like photos and videos, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes." We receive this information so that it can be used for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to have this information shared by these third parties, do not use Facebook or another third party to access Lumosity. We may also collect other information through other social networks that you make available to us. For a description on how social networking and other third party sites handle and share your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings. We may combine information that we collect from or about you with information about you that we obtain from such social media and other content platforms and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.
If you are a subject in a research project or study conducted by Lumos Labs in partnership with a researcher or educational institution, that project may involve the collection of different information than is described in this Section. Research participants may, for example, provide health-related information, including the existence of certain health conditions. Lumos Labs partners with researchers and educational institutions in conducting such studies. Such research projects are typically done on an anonymous basis, such that Lumos Labs acts only as a processor of anonymized or pseudononymized data. For further information on how we handle data associated with such research, please refer to the materials distributed to you as part of the study, contact the researcher leading your study, or contact us using the contact information below.
We use the categories of information identified above to operate and provide you with Lumosity and other services. This includes, but is not limited to the following business and commercial purposes:
For the purposes for which you provided it;
Authenticating your login and processing your payments;
Personalizing your Lumosity experience and customizing your training program;
Allowing you to monitor your performance and progress in Lumosity, by, for example, presenting charts and graphs of your performance to you;
Customizing and delivering information about our products and services by email;
To contact you with information, surveys, or advertising that we believe may be of interest to you regarding us or Lumosity;
To administer contests and surveys;
Providing customer support and sending confirmations about your Account;
For internal research and reporting;
Protecting our intellectual property or other rights; and
Managing and improving our business, our games, and our training.
We also reserve the right to use and disclose non-personal data (e.g., de-identified or aggregate data) for any purpose. For example, we show aggregate performance measures to users to allow them to evaluate their performance against other Lumosity users. Also, in connection with our Human Cognition Project, we may disclose performance statistics to university collaborators to evaluate, study, and improve the effectiveness of our programs or human cognition more generally. In these situations, all data is disclosed either in aggregate form or with information that can identify you removed. In addition, when we work with university collaborators, we contractually prohibit them from attempting to re-identify individuals from data that has been de-identified.
We also use reCAPTCHA v.3 feature of Google to determine whether inputs are made by a natural person or by potentially abusive automated tools (bots). reCAPTCHA uses data such as IP address and activity patterns (e.g., typing/mouse movements) to make such determination. reCAPTCHA is subject to Google’s
Terms of Service
and
Privacy Policy
.
The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them. For example, we handle personal data on this basis for our premium users.
Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent. Where you have provided consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out prior to withdrawing your consent. To withdraw your consent, please contact us at legal@lumoslabs.com.
Legitimate interests: In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as:
Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;
Customer service;
Marketing;
Protecting our users, personnel, and property;
Analyzing and improving our business;
Processing job applications; and
Managing legal issues.
We may also process personal data for the legitimate interests of our research partners, such as to provide cognitive training, research, and analytics for such partners.
Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
To protect the vital interests of the individual or others: For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent safety situation.
We believe in protecting your privacy, and therefore do not provide your personal data to third parties for their own marketing purposes.
We may share the categories of personal information identified in Section 1 for business purposes (as defined by applicable law) or as required by applicable law. More specifically, we may share your personal information in the following situations:
We may share your information with certain third parties selected by us to help support our operations. These include, for example, services that help us process payments, analyze web traffic, send emails, and track customer support requests. In addition, we may share limited personal data to third parties that help us market or advertise Lumosity. These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and we contractually require them to protect your information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
We may share your information with our corporate affiliates, such as entities under common ownership or control.
We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection with an actual or contemplated merger, reorganization, business transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such scenarios, your information may be one of the assets transferred. We will post a notice or otherwise notify you and collect your consent, as may be required by law, before the information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief we are required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal mechanism. We may also disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure may prevent fraud and abuse of Lumosity or its users or protect our property rights.
We may disclose your information when we believe we have your consent to do so, such as when you contact customer support and ask us about your Account, or when we have the consent of someone we believe is authorized to consent on behalf of you, such as the individual associated with the payment method for your Account, or where you share user-generated content with other Lumosity users or publicly. If you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal data collected by Lumosity, we also may disclose your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented.
We may use third-party web analytics services on Lumosity, such as those of Google Analytics, Rollbar, and New Relic. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the "Cookies and other electronic technologies" section to help us analyze how users use Lumosity, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, how often you use our app, the events that occur within our app, where the app was downloaded from, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of Lumosity. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking
here
.
If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications.
We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using Lumosity through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our websites, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via Lumosity may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of Lumosity in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of Lumosity. We also may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and others) to serve tailored ads to you on Lumosity, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access Lumosity. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access Lumosity by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link
or the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link
to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the
Google Ads Settings page
. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into Lumosity, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Account Review
You may access, review, correct, and delete certain of your personal data by logging into your Account.
Analytics and Advertising
You also can exercise certain opt-out rights by following the instructions at the end of the "Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising" section above.
Your Legal Rights
In addition, individuals in the European Union and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to request that we:
confirm whether we hold personal data about them,
provide access to personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form),
update, amend and/or correct personal data we hold;
delete certain personal data in appropriate circumstances;
transfer personal data to a third party provider of services;
To exercise any of the above rights (or any other rights under applicable law), please contact us via our
help center
.
In addition, individuals in the European Union and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances. They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data or exercise legal rights to withdraw consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. To exercise any of the above rights (or any other rights under applicable law), please contact us via our
help center
.
The rights described herein are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law. In situations in which we process personal data on behalf of our research partners, we may refer the request to the relevant research partner and cooperate with their handling of the request, subject to any special contractual arrangement with that research partner.
In addition to the rights above, residents of the European Economic Area also have the right to lodge a complaint with your relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.
Marketing
You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by navigating to your Email Notifications page or by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each email. Please note you may not opt out of certain transactional emails, such as when we email you to confirm transactions, address Account issues, or communicate about customer support.
Push Notifications
From time to time, we use push notifications in our mobile applications to send you messages about Lumosity or your Account. You may opt out from receiving push notifications through your device settings.
California Rights
California residents have certain rights, subject to exceptions. California law may permit you to request that we:
Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
Delete certain information we have about you.
You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide our services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use Lumosity.
You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
If would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request via our
help center
or
webform
. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity.
The CCPA requires us to disclose the categories of “third parties” (as defined by the CCPA) to whom personal information was disclosed or sold. In the preceding 12 months, we may have disclosed user-generated content, such as where you share user-generated content with other Lumosity users or publicly. If you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal data collected by Lumosity, we also may have disclosed your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented. Please review the section above on “When We Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties” for more details on how Lumosity generally shares information collected.
California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. Lumosity does not “sell” your personal information as we understand that term to be defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations.
Nevada Rights
Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law via our via our
help center
. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.
We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.
We have implemented and maintain security practices to protect against the unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of your personal data. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we therefore cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, please contact us using the contact information below.
If you access Lumosity outside of the United States, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of your personal data to, and the collection and processing of such personal data in the United States. The recipients of the personal data disclosures described in the "When We Share Your Personal Data with Third Parties" section above may be located in the United States or elsewhere in the world. Privacy laws in these countries may not provide protections equivalent to those of your country of residence, and your government may or may not deem such protections adequate.
Our website includes links to other sites that may collect personal data, and whose privacy practices may differ from those of Lumos Labs. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.
Our website offers publicly accessible blogs. Some blog posts allow comments via Facebook. You may need to login or contact Facebook both to post comments and to delete personal data that previously was posted in the comments. You can review Facebook’s privacy policy at this link:
https://www.facebook.com/policy.php

We allow you to refer your friends and contacts to Lumosity, either by manually entering their email addresses or by importing contacts from email accounts you have with third parties. If you choose to utilize these features, we’ll use and store the email addresses only for purposes of sending the invitation emails you have requested. If you utilize these features, the friends or contacts that you refer may contact us at the contact information listed below to request that we delete their personal data. Please note that we do not collect the username and password to your email accounts; the import features route you to the third party email provider to log in through their services.
Our website may include social media features, such as Facebook and Twitter buttons. Such features may collect your IP address and information about the page you are visiting, and may set cookies to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the company providing them.

Complaints
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Lumos Labs commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.

Onward Transfers to Third Parties
We remain responsible for all the personal information we receive under the DPF and that we subsequently transfer to third parties acting as agents on our behalf if they process personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF principles, unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Lumosity is not directed to individuals under 13 years old. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13, children under the age of 14 in Spain or South Korea, or from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as required by law. As appropriate under applicable law, parents or legal guardians with questions or requests regarding their children’s personal data may contact us as described below.
We do not track our customers’ personal data over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore do not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals.
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice to you either by email, by posting a notification on Lumosity or by posting an updated privacy policy on Lumosity 45 days in advance of the effective date of the updated Privacy Policy.

We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results.

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the

Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites

Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.

sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
