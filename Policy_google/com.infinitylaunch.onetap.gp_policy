Additionally, we may share your information with third parties who have entrusted us to promote their products or services, in order to help them understand the reach and effectiveness of their promotions. We may disclose your information to other companies or organizations if necessary to abide by laws and regulations, protect our interests and the interests of our affiliates or partners, prevent fraud and other illegal activities, or reduce credit risk.

Your information may also be disclosed at your legal request or with your authorization and consent, or at the legal request of your legal guardian. We may also provide your information in accordance with the individual service agreement that you signed with us (including electronic agreements signed online and corresponding platform rules) or other legal documents.

As our business continues to grow, we may engage in mergers, acquisitions, asset transfers, or similar transactions, and your personal information may be transferred as part of such transactions. We will require any new companies or organizations that hold your personal information to continue to be bound by this policy. Otherwise, we will require the company or organization to seek your authorization again before transferring your personal information.
In cases where we obtain your explicit consent, we will transfer your personal information to other parties.
5.3 Disclosure
We will only disclose your personal information under the following circumstances and with the adoption of industry-standard security measures:
Upon your request and according to the information and disclosure method specified by you;
When we are required to provide your information under laws, regulations, mandatory administrative law enforcement or judicial requirements, we may disclose your information based on the required information type and disclosure method. We will also require the recipient to issue corresponding legal documents, such as subpoenas or investigation letters. We believe in being transparent within the bounds of the law about the information we are asked to provide. All requests will be carefully vetted to ensure that they have a lawful basis and are limited to data that law enforcement has a legal right to obtain for specific investigative purposes;
Disclosing your personal information in litigation or arbitration to protect our legitimate rights and interests;
Sharing, transferring, and disclosing personal information that has been de-identified in accordance with the law. Such actions do not constitute external sharing, transfer, and public disclosure of personal information. Storage and processing of de-identified data will not require further notice or consent from you, and we will take measures to ensure that the data recipient cannot restore and re-identify the information subject.
We are committed to protecting our users' personal information from being disclosed or misused. We do not sell, rent, trade, or in any way disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties, except in the following cases:
A. When we obtain your explicit consent or instructions.
B. When required by relevant laws and regulations or government departments, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the relevant authorities.
C. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties if it is necessary to protect your interests or the public's safety. For example, if you are likely to infringe on the rights, property, or safety of others, we may provide necessary information to third parties to protect the legitimate rights and interests of relevant parties.
We may share certain anonymous information with our partners to improve our products and services. However, these partners are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose, and we will take reasonable steps to protect your information from disclosure.
6. How to retain, store and protect personal information
We adhere to strict retention policies for your personal information, only retaining it for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy and as required by applicable laws and regulations. In the event that we cease operations either partially or completely due to poor management or any other reason, we will notify you of the situation and cease processing your personal information, unless otherwise required by law or agreed upon by both parties. In such cases, we will take measures to delete or anonymize the personal information collected.
6.1 Technical measures for data security
We are committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. To achieve this goal, we will adopt security measures that adhere to industry standards. This includes establishing reasonable system specifications and security technologies to prevent unauthorized access, use, modification, data damage, or loss of your personal information.
Our services employ a variety of encryption technologies to encrypt and securely store your personal information. We also use isolation technology to ensure that your information is kept separate and secure.
When using personal information for tasks such as information display and association calculation, we will employ a range of data desensitization technologies to further enhance the security of your information.
To ensure that personal information is protected from unauthorized use or disclosure, we have implemented strict data access controls and multiple identity authentication technologies. This helps to safeguard your personal information and prevent any misuse of data in violation of regulations.
6.2 Other security measures to protect personal information
To ensure the secure storage and use of personal information, we have established a data classification and grading system, data security management specifications, and data security development specifications. These measures help us implement comprehensive security control over data, including information contact confidentiality agreements and monitoring and auditing mechanisms. We also conduct security and privacy protection training courses to enhance employees' awareness of the importance of protecting information.
6.3 Access control and monitoring mechanism
We only allow Onetap employees and partners who need to access your personal information to do so. We have established strict access control and monitoring mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access. All individuals who may have access to your personal information are required to fulfill corresponding confidentiality obligations. Failure to do so may result in legal action or termination of the partnership with Onetap.
Please note that while we take extensive security measures, the internet is not a completely secure environment. Communication methods with other users such as email or other service software may not be fully encrypted. Therefore, we recommend using complex passwords when using these tools and paying attention to protecting your information security.
6.4 Handling of security incidents
When communicating with a third party or purchasing goods and services through Onetap services, you will inevitably disclose your information, such as contact information, to the counterparty or potential counterparty. Therefore, it is crucial to properly protect your information and only provide it to others when necessary.
To deal with possible risks such as personal information leakage, damage, and loss, we have formulated several systems to clarify the classification and grading standards of security incidents and security vulnerabilities, and the corresponding processing procedures. We have also established a dedicated emergency response team for security incidents. As per the requirements of our security incident handling specifications, we will launch security plans for different security incidents, stop losses, analyze, locate, formulate remedial measures, and cooperate with relevant departments to trace and combat.
Please note that even though we have implemented various security measures to protect your information, we cannot always guarantee 100% security due to technical limitations and external factors beyond our control. The system and communication network you use for Onetap services may experience issues or vulnerabilities.
Therefore, please ensure that you keep your account, password, and other identity elements secure. We identify you through your account number, password, and other identity elements when you use Onetap services. If you suspect or find that your account number, password, and/or other identity elements have been or may have been leaked, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate measures to avoid or minimize related losses.

You can use the "Details" button on the game recommendation page to access these third-party services.
