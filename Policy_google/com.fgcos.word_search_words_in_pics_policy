Privacy Policy
Thanks for using our apps! This Privacy Policy
is meant to help you understand what information
we collect, why we collect it, and how you can
manage and delete your information.
What & Why
We collect information to provide better services
to all our users. In general, the information has
two main use cases. First, to allow us to deliver
our apps and to ensure our apps are working as
intended. Second, to show advertisements.
Advertising is what allows us to offer our apps
for free.
We may collect and use the following information
to provide, improve, protect, and promote our apps:
Classical personal information.
We do not collect classical personal information
through our apps (such as your name, address, email
or phone number) and you can use our apps without
providing us with such information. It may happen
that we obtain some of your classical personal
information when you contact us directly through
support requests or other correspondence. Such
personal information will be treated with the
strictest confidentiality. It will never be shared
with any other entities. Any such personal information
will not be retained beyond the resolution of the
support request or correspondence.
Technical information.
We collect technical information about your
device that enables us to maintain and analyze
the functioning of the app and to display
advertisements.
Device Information.
When you download and use our apps, we automatically
collect information on the type of device you use,
operating system, resolution, app version,
mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID or
advertising ID), language and IP address.
Usage Information.
We collect information automatically about your
activity through our apps (Usage Information),
such as features of our apps that you have used and
your interaction with advertisements.
Cookies and similar data collection technologies.
We and our third party advertising networks and their
partners may use cookies and similar technologies, such
as mobile "SDK", to personalize our apps and to provide
targeted advertisements.
These technologies help to make advertising more effective
by enabling functionality such as stopping you from seeing
the same ad over and over again, detecting click fraud,
and showing ads that are likely to be more relevant (such
as ads based on websites you have visited).
If you wish to opt out of ads personalized in this manner,
please refer to
Appendix B: "Opt-out of personalized ads"
.
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
To provide, maintain and improve our apps.
We use the information to troubleshoot issues that you
report to us. And we use your information to prioritize
the development of new features and improvements
of our apps.
To develop new apps.
Information collected from our current apps helps us
better understand the preferences of our users and to
guide the development of new apps.
To show personalized ads.
With your consent, we may show you personalized ads
based on your interests. We don’t show you personalized
ads based on sensitive categories. We don’t share
information that personally identifies you with advertisers.
You have choices regarding the information we collect
and how it's used. To learn more, see
Appendix C: "Manage your information"
.
With Whom
We cannot provide all services necessary for the successful
operation of the apps by ourselves. We must therefore share
some of the collected information with third parties,
including analytics providers, third party advertising
providers and their fraud prevention providers.
We may share information with:
(Our analytics providers)
We use third party analytics such as Google Firebase for
the purposes of delivering our services, conducting analysis
and research. Such analytical data is anonimized and
aggregated and it is not possible to match it back to you.
To get more information about how your data is
being collected and processed you can visit the link
"How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps"
.
(Third party advertising partners)
Advertising allows us to offer you our apps for free. 
We have contracted with certain third party advertising networks
that assist us in delivering advertising. More information can
be found in
Appendix A: "Advertising networks we work with"
.
(Advertising partner's third party attribution provider)
We allow our advertising partners to measure the performance of
their advertising campaign by tracking performance indicators
such as impressions, clicks and installs. For this they may use
their own third party attribution providers.
(For legal reasons)
We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine
that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any
applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government
request.
If we do disclose any information, we will publish a
Transparency Report
here
as part of our commitment to informing you
about government requests for information. This report details the
types of requests we receive from law enforcement.
In the future, we may collaborate with new partners or
change our existing partners to provide services for our apps.
Any such changes will be promptly reflected here.
For any additional questions about third party information
collection please email us at support@fgcos.com.
Age Constraints
It's important to note that we do not knowingly
engage with individuals below the age of 16.
Should a parent or guardian become aware of any
communication or attempted business transactions
involving a minor under 16, kindly inform us via
email at support@fgcos.com, allowing us to promptly
address the matter.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to
protect our users and respond to technical changes.
We recommend periodic reviews to stay informed.
Continued use of our apps indicates your
acceptance of changes. We will not reduce your
rights under this Privacy Policy without your
explicit consent.
App Certification Program
We participate in, and comply with the policies and technical
specifications of, the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent
Framework (IAB TCF). Our identification number within the
framework is #414 (TCF v2.2 CMP Private).
