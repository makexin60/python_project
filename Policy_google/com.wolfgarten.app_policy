We want you to feel confident about using our Services, so we implement security safeguards designed to protect your data.

Your Personal Information is only processed for as long as needed to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy (considering contextual elements, such as the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide you our Services), or up until such time where you withdraw your consent for processing them.
In such case, we will delete or de-identify your Personal Information. In certain jurisdictions, we may not delete or de-identify your Personal Information if:
We have an overriding interest in keeping your Personal Information identifiable (when retention is advisable in light of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations), or
