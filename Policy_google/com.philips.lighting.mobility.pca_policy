BRAZIL PRIVACY DISCLOSURES
The Brazilian General Law on Data Protection (the "LGPD") provides any person located in Brazil and/or any personal data that has been collected or is processed within Brazil with specific rights over their personal data. In addition to the above, this section describes your LGPD rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
The following does not apply to information or data that cannot identify you or another person, taking into account the use of reasonable and available technical means at the time of its processing.
CONSENT
Whenever necessary, Signify will obtain your consent in advance through a prior, free, informed, unequivocal expression of will, provided by you, and consent may never be obtained in a tacit or implicit manner. Consent for the treatment of sensitive personal data must always spell out the purpose of their treatment in a prominent way.
If there is a change in the purpose of the treatment for which consent obtained, Signify will contact you to obtain new consent regarding the processing of your personal data related to the new purposes. You can revoke the consent if you disagree with the changes made.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA
As described above in this Notice, it may be necessary for Signify to transfer your Personal Data internationally.
We may transfer your Personal Data to countries located outside of Brazil. Some of these countries do not have an adequate level of protection for personal data, as determined by the General Data Protection Law. If the international transfer of Personal Data occurs to countries that do not have personal data protection laws at the same level as the LGPD, we will adopt appropriate measures to protect your Personal Data, such as organizational and legal measures (e.g. binding rules and standard contractual clauses for such transfer).

In certain circumstances, you have the right to object and restrict the processing of your personal data and/or request a review of automated decisions affecting your interest. Our Privacy Notices set out full information on how you can exercise these rights, how we share personal data with third parties, how we protect your personal data and how we ensure that your data is adequately protected if it is processed outside of Brazil.
