ents’/Guardians’ Consent
If you are under 16, you will always need to get your parent(s)/guardian(s) permission before contacting and interacting with us.
We may need to check that your parent(s)/guardian(s) agree that you will use our Services. As part of this check, we may ask you for your parent’s/guardian’s contact details (e.g. email address or telephone number) so we can then contact them and obtain their consent.
We may also carry out checks to ensure that the contact details you have provided for your parent(s)/guardian(s) are your actual parent(s)/guardian(s). If we find out that you have given us fake details about your parent(s)/guardian(s) or if we do not get a reply from your parent(s)/guardian(s) within a reasonable time, we may be incapable to offer our Services to you.
What type of information we collect
We collect two types of data and information from our users.
The first type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“
Personal Information
”). This includes:
Log-in information
: In order to use our Services, you may be required to register/ log-in to the Services. As part of the process, we may collect your name, age, and e-mail address. If you are under 16, we may also ask you for your parent’s/guardian’s contact details (e.g. email address or telephone number), so we can then contact them and obtain their consent.
Activity information
: As part of our Services, we may collect Personal Information which is related to your activity on the Websites or Apps (e.g. what games have you participated in? what is the level you have reached? etc.). This information may help us to track and evaluate your level of English
.
Voluntary information
: We also collect information which you provide us voluntarily. As part of our Services, you may provide us with Personal Information which is related to your place of residence, for the purpose of finding a learning center near you. Additionally, we collect your information when you respond to communications from us, contact our support, communicate with us via email or the Websites or share additional information about yourself or about others through your use of the Services.
Device Information
: We may also collect Personal Information from your device, such as IP address and other online identifiers (i.e. online data collected from user’s devices, applications and protocols which leave traces which may be used to identify users).
Content
: Members of the Helen Doron English Franchise System, such as learning centers, teachers, etc. (collectively: “
HD
Members
”) may upload posts or otherwise make available testimonials, photos, blogs, videos and other content (“
Content
“) on the Services, which may include your Personal Information. Such Content will only be used by us under your (or your parent(s)’/guardian(s)’, as applicable) consent. We as well as other users may see and share the Content, which is publicly available through the Services and through other platforms.
The second type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user(s), which may be made available or gathered via the user’s use of the Services (“
Non-personal Information
”). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected.
Non-personal Information which is being collected may include the following: i) your username and password; ii) information on your activity on the Services (e.g. pages viewed, online browsing, clicks, actions, timestamps, etc.); and aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.).
If we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.
We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose.
Cookies and Google Analytics
We use cookies and other technologies in our related Services, including when you visit our Websites or access our Services.
A “cookie” is a small piece of information that a website assign to your device while you are viewing a website. Cookies are very helpful and can be used for various different purposes. These purposes include allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enable automatic activation of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the interaction between you and our Services quicker and easier. Cookies are also used to compile statistical data on your use of our Services.
Our website uses the following types of cookies:
‘session cookies’
which are stored only temporarily during a browsing session in order to allow normal use of the system and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed;
‘persistent cookies’
which are read only by our website, saved on your computer for a fixed period and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Such cookies are used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits, for example to allow us to store your preferences for the next sign-in;
‘third party cookies’
which are set by other online services who run content on the page you are viewing, for example by third party analytics companies who analyze our web access.
Cookies usually do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but Personal Information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. You may remove the cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences; however, if you choose to disable cookies, some features of our Service may not operate properly and your online experience may be limited.
We also use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about your use of the Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users access the Services, what pages they visit when they do so, etc. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the
Google Analytics Terms of Use
and the
Google Privacy Policy
.
