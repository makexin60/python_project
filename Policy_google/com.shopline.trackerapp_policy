4. What Rights Do You Have?
Under applicable data protection law, you have certain rights in relation to your personal data. Please note
        that
        many of these rights are not absolute and we may have grounds to not fully comply with your request to exercise
        them
        (for example, where we are (a) required or permitted by applicable law to process your personal data in a way
        that
        is
        incompatible with your request, or (b) able to rely on exemptions under applicable data protection law which
        entitle
        us to process your personal data in a way that is incompatible with your request). Where such circumstances
        apply,
        we
        will inform you when we respond to your request to exercise your rights.
4.1 Right to Request Access
You have the right to obtain specific information about the
        processing of your personal data, as well as copies of such personal data, free of charge. You can log in to
        your
        Tracker account at any time to view your personal data.

        data is inaccurate.
4.3 Request to Erasure
You may contact the Company to request the deletion of your
        personal
        data (also known as the "right to be forgotten") without undue delay on various grounds, such as where the
        personal
        data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected or processed.
4.4 Right to Withdraw Consent
Where we process your personal data based on consent, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time.
        However,
        this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted based on consent before any such withdrawal.
        Furthermore, even in case of a withdrawal we may continue to use your personal data as permitted or required by
        law.
4.5 What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and to ensure your right
        to
        access your personal data or access someone else's personal data on their behalf (or to exercise any of the
        other
        rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right
        to
        receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up
        our
        response.
4.6 How to Exercise Your Rights, and Responding to Your Requests

        under
        this section you can contact the Company using the contact methods provided at Section 7 in this Policy. We try
        to
        respond to all legitimate requests within one month although occasionally it could take us longer than a month;
        for
        example, if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests, this may be extended
        to
        an
        additional two months. To ensure security, the Company may first verify your identity before processing your
        request.
5. How Do We Protect Personal Data?
The Company takes the security of your personal data very seriously. We have implemented industry-standard
        security
        technologies, organizational frameworks, and management systems to provide multi-level protection measures to
        prevent

5.1 Data Security Technology Measures

        prevent malicious attacks. The Company uses encryption storage and access control mechanisms for personal data
        to

        outside
        of
        Singapore. Nonetheless, we will ensure that your personal information is adequately protected as it is in the
        country
        or region where you are located and will use encryption in cross border data transfer.
5.3 Personnel Organizational and Management Measures
The Company has established internal
        control management processes for personal data based on the principle of minimum necessity, setting information
        access
        permissions for employees who may come into contact with your personal data, and controlling the scope of
        knowledge
        regarding personal data.
We have internal rules for data security usage and apply strict management to employees or outsourced personnel
        who
        may handle personal data, including, but not limited to: setting different access levels based on job roles,
        signing
        confidentiality agreements with employees and/or outsourced personnel, and conducting regular audits of employee
        and/or outsourced personnel operations.

        to
        raise awareness of the importance of protecting personal data.

3. How you exercise rights over your personal information
You have the right to, at any time:
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables
          you to
          receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any
          incomplete
          or
          inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
          provide
          to us.
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal
          information
          where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
          remove
          your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
          below),
          where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal
          information
          to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure
          for
          specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a Legitimate Interest (or those of
          a
          third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
          processing
          on
          this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
          where
          we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate
          that we
          have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
          processing of your personal information in the following scenarios:
- If you want us to establish the dataâ€™s accuracy;
- Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
- Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need
            it to establish, exercise
            or
            defend
            legal claims; and
- You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we
            have overriding legitimate
            grounds
            to
            use it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a
          third
          party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
          that
          this right only applies to information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the
          information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However,
          this
          will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw
          your
          consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
          case
          at the time you withdraw your consent.
Make a complaint to the supervisory authority. if you are unhappy about how we process your personal
          information,
          you can always file a complaint with the supervisory authority. We would however appreciate the opportunity to
          resolve your concerns in the first instance before you contact the supervisory authority.
