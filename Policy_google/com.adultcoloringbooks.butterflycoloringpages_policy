What We Know About You
We don’t ask for your name or email. Just your age to make sure our games are right for you.
We notice what games you like, how you play them, and what ads you see, but nothing that tells us exactly who you are.

To show you ads about things you might like

. But nothing scary or not meant for kids.
Keeping Your Info Safe
Your info is like a secret treasure. We keep it safe and only share it with people who help make our games better.
Even in this case, they can use your info only to help us make our games more fun and interesting to you, and not for any other purposes.
Special Care for Kids
If you’re under 13, we’re extra careful! We don’t collect any personal info from you without saying “OK”
from your parents
