Privacy and Safety Tips
Please consider how much information and the accuracy of such information that you share with us and other members.
Date of Birth:
You may select a random day and month to enhance your privacy. While we do not disclose your birthdate, your displayed age might allow others to deduce it over time.
Photos:
Avoid sharing images that could reveal sensitive details like your home, car license plate, or personal contact numbers.
Personal Information:
Do not share personal details (e.g., phone numbers, home addresses, financial data) with other users. If you need to exchange contact details, consider using a temporary social media account instead of your primary one.
Profile Security:
Refrain from posting contact details or social media handles on your profile, as these could be exploited by data harvesters.
Username:
Choose a pseudonym instead of your real name for your username to maintain anonymity.
Email Registration:
Use a private email address rather than a disposable one to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Consider using an email alias from providers like Gmail for registration to provide us with a unique email and to give you confidence we do not sell your email address.
Information We Collect and How we use it
Without any information from you it is impossible to participate in online dating. Some information is mandatory such as your date of birth while other information is optional such as profile bio information. As well as information provided by you we also collect information automatically such as your IP address and access times. This information helps improve the quality of our matching, develop our products, and provide a more safe dating environment.
Providing accurate information is not always necessary especially to help protect your privacy such as sharing your date of birth. Please remember anything that you share on your profile is publicly available and even after we delete your information it may still exist if other users have taken a screenshot or stored it. Please keep this in mind when sharing your information and never share information like your home address, phone number or financial information on your profile or in messages with other users.

Data Shared with Third Parties
We collaborate with third parties to enhance our service delivery. This includes error reporting services for service improvement, security services for fraud prevention and safety, analytics services to optimize user experience, advertising services to expand our user base, and moderation services for compliance and complaint resolution. We also share data with customer support to assist with account issues and law enforcement when required for legal investigations.
Age Policy
Our services are strictly for users aged 18 and over. If you encounter a user who may be under 18, or if you see a photo featuring a child, please report it immediately. We actively remove such content to ensure compliance with our age policy. Additionally, we prohibit users from indicating whether they have children in their profiles to safeguard against potential online predators.
Face Verification
Face verification is optional and we will ask for your consent before beginning the process. The process can be completed using any device with a webcam but on a phone is easiest. To verify you can initiate it from your edit profile page. By verifying, you assure others that the photos in your profile are truly yours. Verified users can also search for other verified users. Your facial geometry data and reference images are stored as long as your account is active to enable future photo verifications.
What data is collected?
A short selfie video is taken with your consent to create geometric data to confirm the authenticity of your profile photos. This video is immediately deleted after processing, although screenshots may be kept privately for moderation purposes in case of complaints against your profile.
Will the data be shared with third parties?
The video is temporarily shared with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for processing and is then deleted. AWS retains the geometric data. In the event of complaints, reference images may be shared with our moderation team.
Where will this data be stored?
While the selfie video is deleted after processing, reference images and geometric data are stored on our private servers and with AWS, respectively.
How long will the data be stored?
The reference images and geometric data are retained for the lifetime of your account. Upon deletion, this data is removed within 30 days. If your account is banned, your data may be held for up to one year to assist in investigating potential unlawful activity and protecting members, preventing abusive users from repeatedly rejoining.
