Inventory quantities are updated frequently throughout the business day. Traxxas does not guarantee that items listed as 'in-stock' or 'available' on this site will be available at the time of order fulfillment.

Some of these third party sites are necessary to add functionality to this site, i.e. tracking numbers, etc.. By using this site, you agree that Traxxas is not responsible for the operation of or content located on or through any such sites.
Order Acceptance
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not guarantee our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell.
Traxxas reserves the right at any time after the receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. Traxxas reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. In order to minimize fraud, some orders placed over $750.00 (U.S.) must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and fraud avoidance department. For orders over $750.00 (U.S.), please call 1-888-TRAXXAS (1-888-872-9927) (U.S. residents only; outside the U.S., call +1-972-549-3000). We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Traxxas.com is intended solely for Traxxas' end user customers and currently does not accept large orders from dealers, exporters, wholesalers, or other customers who intend to resell the products offered by Traxxas.com.
Internet orders generate an automatic confirmation and response e-mail. These automatic confirmations and response e-mails are subject to correction prior to delivery due to errors, changing market conditions, product discontinuation or unavailability, typographical errors, or any other reason. Our internet pages are an invitation for you to make us an offer to buy the items described; our actual delivery constitutes our acceptance of your offer.

System Abuse
Without limitation, you agree not to send, create or reply to so called e-mail bombs [denial of service concept] (i.e., e-mailing copies of a single message to many users, or sending large or multiple files or messages to a single user with malicious intent), engage in spamming (i.e., unsolicited e-mailing for business or other purposes), or undertake any other activity that may adversely affect the operation or enjoyment of this site by any other person.

Security
Traxxas uses industry standard physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information collected online.

Traxxas reserves the right to monitor your password and, at its discretion, require you to change it. If you use a password that Traxxas considers insecure, we reserve the right to require it to be changed and/or terminate your account.
Although Traxxas takes appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, Traxxas cannot guarantee you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may happen as a result of unauthorized access (hack attempts) to the site. For more details, please see the Privacy Policy listed above.
Credit Card Authorization Charges
We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.  We do not add any credit card surcharges. Traxxas reserves the right to place temporary authorization charges on your credit card in order to process your order. The charges are used to test that a credit card account is active and has credit available to accommodate the transactions. This test creates a temporary authorization transaction that appears on the account. The temporary authorization transaction is not necessarily equal to the actual amount charged, but rather an anticipated amount that is used until the actual charge is processed. The actual transaction amount will appear on the account once the transaction is finished processing. The temporary authorization charge is removed from the account within 30 days after it first appears. Temporary authorization charges will temporarily reduce the account's available line of credit or available cash by the anticipated amount. If for some reason the actual charge is canceled and not processed, the temporary authorization will automatically be removed from your account 30 days after it first appears. This is standard practice for credit card transactions that has been established by the card issuers, not Traxxas.

You agree not to send, create, or reply to so-called e-mail bombs (i.e., e-mailing copies of a single message to many users, or sending large or multiple files or messages to a single user with malicious intent), engage in spamming (i.e., unsolicited e-mailing for business or other purposes), or undertake any other activity which may adversely affect the operation or enjoyment of this site by any other person.
Security
Any passwords used for this site are for individual use only. You are responsible for the security of your password. Traxxas shall be entitled to monitor your password and, at its discretion, require you to change it. If you use a password that Traxxas considers insecure, Traxxas will be entitled to require this to be changed and/or terminate your account.
Traxxas reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of this site with or without notice, and/or to modify or establish new guidelines and limitations on their use.
The Most Important Rule of All
The most important rule to remember is to not say anything to another member via the Traxxas forum that you wouldn't say to that person if he/she were standing right in front of you. If it helps, then imagine that person is much larger and meaner than you. If you can't say anything nice, or offer criticism in a useful, constructive manner, then simply move on and don't reply to the post. Traxxas moderators/marshals will remove pointless inflammatory posts and you could quickly find yourself banned if you persist. Do your part to make the moderator's jobs easy.
General Guidelines for the Good Poster
People who frequent message boards have developed their own set of etiquette and manners for good posting within the forums. If you are new to message forums, then please adhere to the following guidelines. Following these few simple rules will help you post like a pro right from the start.
Try to keep your remarks positive. If you don't have anything good to say about one topic, then simply pass it and move onto the next. If you must criticize, do it in a constructive manner, not in a harsh, condescending one. If you have had a bad day, please don't try take it out on the forum members. Pointless criticism and bashing only makes you look bad and will certainly get the attention of the moderator.
DHelp out the new guys. Remember that everyone was a beginner once. The faster you feed new people with good information, the faster they will become good contributing members of the forum. Posts that put down and ridicule "newbies" or attempt to run them out of the forum are not allowed. Other forum members will look up to you for being helpful to novices and ignore you for being arrogant and insulting. What type of person do you want other forum members to see?
Do not attempt to artificially increase your post count with one line posts. Some members try to attach prestige to themselves by the number of posts they have made. They will use many pointless, one line posts to inflate their post count. Examples might be posting just to say, "I agree" or "My thoughts exactly". These kinds of posts do not offer much to the discussion and take up valuable space in the forum. Try to advance the discussion with relevant input each time you post a comment; other forum members will appreciate you for it.
Do not post anything in a topic where it doesn't belong. For example, don't ask a question about your electric Rustler in the T-Maxx forum. Other members won't take you seriously, and moderators will just move or delete the post.
Stick with topics that are related to R/C models only. We want to keep our forum all about R/C-related interests. If you wish to change the subject, please use another forum.
Be specific when posting topic and subject headings. Don't use topic headings such as "LOOOOOK!!!!" or "HELP!!!!!!!!!" The whole point of posting is to get your post read. Vague topic headings may cause other members to ignore your post. If you need help with an engine, give the topic this title: I need engine help. You will get much better response, and the forum will be much easier to read. Moderators may rename topics if the heading has nothing to do with the subject.
Do not type in ALL CAPS. Typing in all caps will offend forum veterans because they will think that you are YELLING at them.
Practice good grammar and typing skills. Posts that have misspelled words, poor grammar, and SlOppY tYpInG are very difficult to read. Again, the reason you are posting is so that your thought will be read. Moderators may delete the worst examples at their discretion. If English is your second language, then let forum members know so that they can exercise patience when reading your posts.
Keep your signatures to three lines (carriage returns) or less, including your name, a quote, and a URL. Signatures cannot be more than three lines total, including wraparounds. Long signatures become annoying and cause other users to need to scroll further down the page.
Do not attempt to bypass the language filters by using $ymbols, *stars, e x t r a s p a c e s, etc. Moderators will delete your entire post. There are kids as well as adults participating in the forum. Keep the Traxxas forum rated "G" for all ages. Be the one to set a good example for others.
Use the Forum Search. Before starting a new topic, use the search function to see if it has already been discussed. Be a good guy and don't make regular forum members have to repeat themselves time and time again.
Discourage the "which is better" type of threads. These topics appear amateurish and often lead to flame wars. Solicit opinions about the products in question, and then decide for yourself which one is better for you. If the thread becomes an extended flame war, the moderators may lock the topic at their discretion her forum members will look up to you for being helpful to novices and ignore you for being arrogant and insulting. What type of person do you want other forum members (and the moderators) to see you as?
Don't abuse the Marketplace Forum. We have set up a forum that will allow you to post "for sale" ads. The marketplace forum is for individuals only and is not to be used for commercial advertising purposes. Use this forum to sell your used Traxxas products. Do not use this forum to sell the new T-Maxx parts you are making in your garage. Be sure to read our cautions about purchasing from the marketplace forum.
Do not use the forum to contact Traxxas Customer Support. Posts that deal with warranty and service issues will be removed and forwarded to Customer Support, increasing the amount of time it takes for you to get a response. If you have support-related issues, please contact
Customer Support
directly.
Don't believe everything you read. The Traxxas message forum is truly a global community able to accept posts from all over the world. Other than the clearly marked Traxxas moderators, you don't really know who is behind the alias making the post. Many posts contain opinions that may or may not be based on facts or real experience. Use the search function to view the poster's other threads. This may help you determine the credibility of the poster's information. Check everything out before you act.
Marketplace Forum
The Marketplace Forum is a free service provided to allow you to post "for sale" ads. The Marketplace Forum is for individuals only and is not to be used for commercial advertising purposes. Only Traxxas products are allowed. Do not use this forum to sell the parts you are making in your garage that fit Traxxas products.
Buyer Beware! Purchase items in the Marketplace Forum at your own risk!
Traxxas does not officially know, promote, certify, or endorse any of the sellers or seller's merchandise. There is always risk involved with purchasing from unknown individuals online. You alone assume all risk and responsibility for those transactions. You alone are responsible for taking necessary precautions to protect yourself from potential internet fraud. Traxxas will play no role whatsoever in transactions initiated by individuals acting on their own behalf in the Marketplace Forum. You agree Traxxas is not liable for any claims arising from your use of the Marketplace Forum.

Policies, pricing, and item availability are subject to change without notice, and we reserve the right to limit quantities. Prices, quantities, and availability displayed on our site are subject to final approval at the time of order fulfillment. The inventory images are shown for representational purposes only.

The actual product may vary from the similar image.
Web, e-mail offers, and other advertisements are subject to correction.

The online inventory is virtual and does not show real time inventory. Traxxas strives in good faith to provide the most accurate availability information possible on this site and maintain the security and integrity of our order processing system. Inventory quantities are updated frequently throughout the business day. Traxxas does not guarantee that items listed as 'in-stock' or 'available' on this site will be available at the time of order fulfillment. All inventory listed on the site is subject to prior sale by Traxxas.
During the order process, placing an item in your shopping cart does not reserve the item (remove it from available inventory) until final checkout and credit card processing.

This site may contain links to other sites on the internet that are owned and operated by third parties. Some of these third party sites are necessary to add functionality to this site, i.e. tracking numbers, etc.. By using this site, you agree that Traxxas is not responsible for the operation of or content located on or through any such sites.
Order Acceptance
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not guarantee our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell.
Traxxas reserves the right at any time after the receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. Traxxas reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. In order to minimize fraud, some orders placed over $750.00 (U.S.) must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and fraud avoidance department. For orders over $750.00 (U.S.), please call 1-888-TRAXXAS (1-888-872-9927) (U.S. residents only; outside the U.S., call +1-972-549-3000). We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Traxxas.com is intended solely for Traxxas' end user customers and currently does not accept large orders from dealers, exporters, wholesalers, or other customers who intend to resell the products offered by Traxxas.com.
Internet orders generate an automatic confirmation and response e-mail. These automatic confirmations and response e-mails are subject to correction prior to delivery due to errors, changing market conditions, product discontinuation or unavailability, typographical errors, or any other reason. Our internet pages are an invitation for you to make us an offer to buy the items described; our actual delivery constitutes our acceptance of your offer.
Sales Tax
Traxxas charges applicable sales tax for items subject to tax.
For tax exempt institutions, please contact Traxxas support at 972-549-3000 prior to placing any order. Traxxas.com orders are not tax-exempt.
System Abuse
Without limitation, you agree not to send, create or reply to so called e-mail bombs [denial of service concept] (i.e., e-mailing copies of a single message to many users, or sending large or multiple files or messages to a single user with malicious intent), engage in spamming (i.e., unsolicited e-mailing for business or other purposes), or undertake any other activity that may adversely affect the operation or enjoyment of this site by any other person.

Inadvertent disclosures may happen as a result of unauthorized access (hack attempts) to the site. For more details, please see the Privacy Policy listed above.
Credit Card Authorization Charges
We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.  We do not add any credit card surcharges. Traxxas reserves the right to place temporary authorization charges on your credit card in order to process your order. The charges are used to test that a credit card account is active and has credit available to accommodate the transactions. This test creates a temporary authorization transaction that appears on the account. The temporary authorization transaction is not necessarily equal to the actual amount charged, but rather an anticipated amount that is used until the actual charge is processed. The actual transaction amount will appear on the account once the transaction is finished processing. The temporary authorization charge is removed from the account within 30 days after it first appears. Temporary authorization charges will temporarily reduce the account's available line of credit or available cash by the anticipated amount. If for some reason the actual charge is canceled and not processed, the temporary authorization will automatically be removed from your account 30 days after it first appears. This is standard practice for credit card transactions that has been established by the card issuers, not Traxxas.

Traxxas shall be entitled to monitor your password and, at its discretion, require you to change it. If you use a password that Traxxas considers insecure, Traxxas will be entitled to require this to be changed and/or terminate your account.
Traxxas reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of this site with or without notice, and/or to modify or establish new guidelines and limitations on their use.
The Most Important Rule of All
The most important rule to remember is to not say anything to another member via the Traxxas forum that you wouldn't say to that person if he/she were standing right in front of you. If it helps, then imagine that person is much larger and meaner than you. If you can't say anything nice, or offer criticism in a useful, constructive manner, then simply move on and don't reply to the post. Traxxas moderators/marshals will remove pointless inflammatory posts and you could quickly find yourself banned if you persist. Do your part to make the moderator's jobs easy.
General Guidelines for the Good Poster
People who frequent message boards have developed their own set of etiquette and manners for good posting within the forums. If you are new to message forums, then please adhere to the following guidelines. Following these few simple rules will help you post like a pro right from the start.
Try to keep your remarks positive. If you don't have anything good to say about one topic, then simply pass it and move onto the next. If you must criticize, do it in a constructive manner, not in a harsh, condescending one. If you have had a bad day, please don't try take it out on the forum members. Pointless criticism and bashing only makes you look bad and will certainly get the attention of the moderator.
DHelp out the new guys. Remember that everyone was a beginner once. The faster you feed new people with good information, the faster they will become good contributing members of the forum. Posts that put down and ridicule "newbies" or attempt to run them out of the forum are not allowed. Other forum members will look up to you for being helpful to novices and ignore you for being arrogant and insulting. What type of person do you want other forum members to see?
Do not attempt to artificially increase your post count with one line posts. Some members try to attach prestige to themselves by the number of posts they have made. They will use many pointless, one line posts to inflate their post count. Examples might be posting just to say, "I agree" or "My thoughts exactly". These kinds of posts do not offer much to the discussion and take up valuable space in the forum. Try to advance the discussion with relevant input each time you post a comment; other forum members will appreciate you for it.
Do not post anything in a topic where it doesn't belong. For example, don't ask a question about your electric Rustler in the T-Maxx forum. Other members won't take you seriously, and moderators will just move or delete the post.
Stick with topics that are related to R/C models only. We want to keep our forum all about R/C-related interests. If you wish to change the subject, please use another forum.
Be specific when posting topic and subject headings. Don't use topic headings such as "LOOOOOK!!!!" or "HELP!!!!!!!!!" The whole point of posting is to get your post read. Vague topic headings may cause other members to ignore your post. If you need help with an engine, give the topic this title: I need engine help. You will get much better response, and the forum will be much easier to read. Moderators may rename topics if the heading has nothing to do with the subject.
Do not type in ALL CAPS. Typing in all caps will offend forum veterans because they will think that you are YELLING at them.
Practice good grammar and typing skills. Posts that have misspelled words, poor grammar, and SlOppY tYpInG are very difficult to read. Again, the reason you are posting is so that your thought will be read. Moderators may delete the worst examples at their discretion. If English is your second language, then let forum members know so that they can exercise patience when reading your posts.
Keep your signatures to three lines (carriage returns) or less, including your name, a quote, and a URL. Signatures cannot be more than three lines total, including wraparounds. Long signatures become annoying and cause other users to need to scroll further down the page.
Do not attempt to bypass the language filters by using $ymbols, *stars, e x t r a s p a c e s, etc. Moderators will delete your entire post. There are kids as well as adults participating in the forum. Keep the Traxxas forum rated "G" for all ages. Be the one to set a good example for others.
Use the Forum Search. Before starting a new topic, use the search function to see if it has already been discussed. Be a good guy and don't make regular forum members have to repeat themselves time and time again.
Discourage the "which is better" type of threads. These topics appear amateurish and often lead to flame wars. Solicit opinions about the products in question, and then decide for yourself which one is better for you. If the thread becomes an extended flame war, the moderators may lock the topic at their discretion her forum members will look up to you for being helpful to novices and ignore you for being arrogant and insulting. What type of person do you want other forum members (and the moderators) to see you as?
Don't abuse the Marketplace Forum. We have set up a forum that will allow you to post "for sale" ads. The marketplace forum is for individuals only and is not to be used for commercial advertising purposes. Use this forum to sell your used Traxxas products. Do not use this forum to sell the new T-Maxx parts you are making in your garage. Be sure to read our cautions about purchasing from the marketplace forum.
Do not use the forum to contact Traxxas Customer Support. Posts that deal with warranty and service issues will be removed and forwarded to Customer Support, increasing the amount of time it takes for you to get a response. If you have support-related issues, please contact
Customer Support
directly.
Don't believe everything you read. The Traxxas message forum is truly a global community able to accept posts from all over the world. Other than the clearly marked Traxxas moderators, you don't really know who is behind the alias making the post. Many posts contain opinions that may or may not be based on facts or real experience. Use the search function to view the poster's other threads. This may help you determine the credibility of the poster's information. Check everything out before you act.
Marketplace Forum
The Marketplace Forum is a free service provided to allow you to post "for sale" ads. The Marketplace Forum is for individuals only and is not to be used for commercial advertising purposes. Only Traxxas products are allowed. Do not use this forum to sell the parts you are making in your garage that fit Traxxas products.
Buyer Beware! Purchase items in the Marketplace Forum at your own risk!
Traxxas does not officially know, promote, certify, or endorse any of the sellers or seller's merchandise. There is always risk involved with purchasing from unknown individuals online. You alone assume all risk and responsibility for those transactions. You alone are responsible for taking necessary precautions to protect yourself from potential internet fraud. Traxxas will play no role whatsoever in transactions initiated by individuals acting on their own behalf in the Marketplace Forum. You agree Traxxas is not liable for any claims arising from your use of the Marketplace Forum.
