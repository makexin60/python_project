8.6.

Further, the information provided herein should not be taken as financial planning, investment solicitation or trading advice. No fiduciary relationship has been created between your and Blockpit. The reports and information prepared within the framework of Cryptotax do not constitute tax advisory services within the meaning of the Austrian Act on the Profession of Chartered Accountants and Tax Consultants (Wirtschaftstreuhandberufsgesetz).

The determined information is merely based on pre-programmed mathematical algorithms which process the transaction data provided by the Blockpit Customer. You agree that Blockpit does not check individual transaction data for its correctness and/or accuracy.
8.9.
Blockpit's right of use
. You hereby grant Blockpit a free, non-exclusive and unrestricted right of use to the content published, transmitted and/or generated by you in the course of using or via the Blockpit Applications. Blockpit is entitled to use, modify and/or edit this content both within the scope of its own business activities and within the scope of the business activities of its affiliated companies, provided that this does not impair the legitimate interests of the Blockpit Customer. In the event that the content is used outside of the Blockpit Applications, Blockpit will - to the extent feasible - indicate that the content was published, transmitted and/or generated by the Blockpit Customer. Except otherwise provided herein, Blockpit will not sell to or share any of your data with third parties.
9. Right of Withdrawal
9.1.
Withdrawal before fulfilment by Blockpit
. In the case of contracts for download software and apps - such as the Blockpit Applications - Consumer Customers are always entitled to a right of withdrawal
if no service has yet been provided by the company (Blockpit)
. In this case, the Consumer Customer has the right to withdraw from the concluded contract within 14 (fourteen) days after the conclusion of the contract without giving reasons. This 14-day period begins on the day the contract is concluded. In order to exercise this right of withdrawal, the Consumer Customer must inform Blockpit of his decision to withdraw from the concluded contract by means of a clear declaration. The Consumer Customer may use the model cancellation form (
Annex II
) for this purpose, but is not obliged to do so. The exercise of the right of cancellation by the Consumer Customer shall be deemed to have been made in good time if the Consumer Customer sends the corresponding declaration before the expiry of the cancellation period and can provide proof of a confirmation of transmission and, furthermore, no service has yet been provided by Blockpit. If the Consumer Customer withdraws from the concluded contract, Blockpit must refund all payments received without delay, but no later than 14 (fourteen) days after the day on which Blockpit received notification of the cancellation. For this repayment, Blockpit will use the same means of payment that the Consumer Customer used in the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with the Consumer Customer. When purchasing via an affiliate link, the affiliate receives a certain percentage of the purchase price paid. In the event of cancellation, the Consumer Customer will be paid the purchase price minus this affiliate payment. If the Consumer Customer does not agree to this, they must delete the affiliate cookie before making the purchase or open the incognito mode in the browser before placing the order in order to place an order without an affiliate.
9.2.
Loss of the Right of Withdrawal.
By purchasing a Blockpit licence, the Customer agrees to these Terms and Conditions and expressly requests the immediate execution of the contract. They thereby acknowledge that they lose their right to withdraw from this contract as soon as Blockpit has started to provide any digital content (e.g., by downloading a tax report). This does not affect the right of a Customer to withdraw from the contract if a technical problem on the part of Blockpit, e.g. an error or bug, cannot be resolved by Blockpit within a reasonable period of time.
9.3.
Contract confirmation
. Blockpit will send a confirmation of the concluded contract including these Terms and Conditions to the Customer immediately after the purchase of a license.
10. Obligations of the Blockpit Customer to act and cooperate

10.1.8. refrain from disruptive interventions with technical or electronic aids in the Blockpit Applications, in particular hacking attempts, brute force attacks, infiltration of viruses, worms or Trojans or other attempts to disrupt the Blockpit Applications; and
10.1.9. not to copy, distribute and transmit accessible data without the express consent of the respective rights holder or to read such data with technical aids (e.g. crawlers or bots).

In this case, the Blockpit Customer can also switch at any time within the notice period to a paid Customer Account in accordance with Section 6.3.
11.2.
Paid Customer Account
Both Blockpit and the Blockpit Customer can terminate the business relationship at any time. The right of the Consumer Customer to terminate free of charge due to a change in the Blockpit T&C remains unaffected. In addition, Blockpit may, at its own discretion, accept an ordinary termination without observing any notice period.
12. Extraordinary termination rights
12.1. Blockpit or a Blockpit Customer may terminate the entire business relationship at any time without observing a notice period and with immediate effect for good cause.

No warranty towards Business Customers

Blockpit is not liable in the event that data is tracked, recorded or falsified by third parties.
15. Limitations of liability
15.1.
Liability towards Consumer Customers
. Blockpit is liable for damages incurred by a Consumer Customer for itself and its vicarious agents - for whatever legal reason including tort - only if Blockpit or its vicarious agents have culpably violated an essential contractual obligation (cardinal obligation) in a way that endangers the purpose of the contract or if the damage is based on gross negligence or intent of Blockpit or its vicarious agents. If the culpable breach of an essential contractual obligation (cardinal obligation) is only slightly negligent, Blockpit's liability is limited to such typical damages that were reasonably foreseeable for Blockpit upon conclusion of the contract. This limitation of liability also applies to the extent of the damage. In the aforementioned cases, the liability for a financial loss is limited to the sum of the payments made to Blockpit by the concretely affected Blockpit Customer. The aforementioned limitations of liability do not apply in the absence of warranted characteristics, a liability of Blockpit according to the Austrian Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz) or in the case of personal injury.
15.2.
Liability towards Business Customers
. Blockpit is not liable for damages incurred by a Business Customer in connection with the Blockpit Applications and/or the products and services offered thereon, unless such damage was caused by Blockpit intentionally or through gross negligence or in the case of personal injury.
15.3.
Third Party Services
. When using websites or services that are not provided by Blockpit ("
third-party services
"), Blockpit expressly assumes no liability for the content, availability or performance of such third parties and is not liable for any damage or loss incurred by a Blockpit Customer or any third party in the use of such third-party services (e.g. due to errors, problems, viruses or loss of data). The Blockpit Customer uses such third-party services solely at their own risk. Blockpit cannot and do not verify the reliability of such third parties or their services.
15.4.
External content
. Blockpit assumes no liability for external links, banners or other information and advertising offers placed by third parties on the Blockpit Applications. In the event that the Blockpit Customer concludes a legal transaction with a third-party provider via a linked page, a banner or in connection with information and advertising offers, Blockpit assumes no liability for the services of the third-party provider.
16. Other provisions
16.1
No Waiver of Rights
. Blockpit's failure at any time or for any period to enforce or exercise any provision of these Blockpit T&C or any right or remedy arising under these Blockpit T&C shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such right or remedy and shall not in any way affect Blockpit's right to enforce or exercise the same at any subsequent time, provided that such right is not time-barred, expired or otherwise precluded.
16.2
Period of validity
. These Blockpit T&C shall continue to apply after termination of the business relationship until complete settlement or mutatis mutandis.

For Consumer Customers, this only applies insofar as the law of their country of residence does not grant them a more favourable legal position vis-à-vis Blockpit in the individual case.
17.2.
Severability
. If any provision of these T&C is or becomes invalid, void, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions of these T&C shall not be affected. In place of the invalid, void, illegal or otherwise unenforceable provision(s), that provision shall apply which, to the extent legally possible, best corresponds in its economic effect to the invalid, void, illegal or otherwise unenforceable provision(s). This shall also apply mutatis mutandis in the event of an unplanned loophole in these T&C.
17.3.

Privacy Policy
Privacy & Data Protection at Blockpit
The privacy of our users, and therefore the protection of your personal data, is our top priority. For this reason, we not only encrypt all data and data transfers in accordance with current industry standards, but we have also restricted the processing of personal data to absolutely necessary areas only. We will never pass your data on to third parties.
With this Data Protection Declaration within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Blockpit AG, FN 477383i, Peter-Behrens-Platz 4/6. OG, 4020 Linz, as the responsible body for data processing (for contact details see our imprint), explains Who, What, When, How, Why and Where personal customer data is processed. The collection, administration and use of personal data by Blockpit complies with the highest security and data protection regulations applicable in the European Union and its member states.
What?
First of all, we would like to point out that the entire software solution provided by Blockpit is basically completely independent of the disclosure of personal data, i.e. data that can be clearly assigned to a specific person, and can therefore also be operated fully functional on an anonymised or pseudonymised basis
.
A valid e-mail address must be provided when registering to use the Blockpit applications. Other information, however, is optional and voluntary during registration and can be added or deleted by the user afterwards (e.g. first and last name; date of birth; address). Blockpit does not currently offer the option of encryption of individual user accounts.
We process the personal data that we receive from you as part of our business relationship (mandatory and voluntary). We may also process personal data that we legitimately receive from publicly accessible sources. This may include the following personal data:
Personal details (e.g. name, address, contact details, date of birth, gender, place of birth, nationality)
Legitimisation data (e.g. ID card data) and authentication data
Order data (e.g. payment orders and wallet or account number)
Data from the fulfilment of our contractual obligations (e.g. purchase amount, exchange amount, virtual payment data)
Information in accordance with the KYC principle resulting from the legal obligations in the Financial Market Money Laundering Act (e.g. customer profile, documentation on the purpose and nature of the business relationship, proof of origin of funds, PEP check)
Advertising and sales data
Documentation data (e.g. counselling protocols, meeting notes)
Processing results that we generate ourselves and data in fulfilment of legal and regulatory requirements
Why?
The purpose of data collection is the automated data processing and provision of services in the context of transaction analyses and applications in the field of blockchain technology. Blockpit has a business licence for services in automatic data processing and information technology. If the aforementioned personal data has been disclosed to us, we may process it in the following ways:
for the fulfilment of contractual obligations (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) for the provision of our services and in particular for the performance of our contracts with you or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request, as well as for the performance of all activities necessary for the operation and administration of our company and for legal and claims prosecution. The purposes of data processing may also include needs analyses, quality assurance, consulting and the execution of transactions; or
to fulfil legal obligations (Art. 6 para. 1 lit c GDPR; e.g., Financial Market Money Laundering Act, tax laws, possible future regulatory requirements) for identity and age verification, fraud and money laundering prevention, the fulfilment of tax and regulatory control and reporting obligations; or
within the scope of your consent (Art 6 para 1 lit a GDPR), insofar as you have given us your consent to the processing of personal data for specific purposes; or
to safeguard legitimate interests (Art 6 para 1 lit f GDPR) in the context of balancing interests in favour of Blockpit or a third party, such as in cases of consultation of and data exchange with credit agencies, advertising or market research (unless you have objected to the use of your data), measures to protect customers and employees as well as Blockpit's property, measures to prevent and combat fraud (transaction monitoring) and measures for business management and further development of products and services.
For technical reasons, the following data that your browser transmits to us or to our web space provider is also recorded (so-called server log files):
Browser type and version
Operating system used
Website from which you visit us (referrer URL)
Website you visit
Date and time of your access
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal data you may have provided and therefore does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about a specific person. It is evaluated for statistical purposes in order to optimise our website and our offers.
All data that the user has processed on the blockpit.io platform will be (i) anonymised or (ii) deleted within 30 days of termination or exclusion, provided that there are no legal storage obligations or legitimate interests to the contrary. At the user's request, all personal data relating to the user will be deleted, provided there are no legal retention obligations or legitimate interests to the contrary. This requires an email with the email address provided during registration and the request for final deletion to legal@blockpit.io. Blockpit will comply with such requests within the statutory period.
Who and Where?
Blockpit treats all user data confidentially and only publishes such data if required by law or with the express consent of the user. At Blockpit, only those departments or employees receive access to your data who need it to fulfil contractual, legal and potential regulatory obligations and to protect legitimate interests. The service providers we use (processors) also only receive data from us if they need this data to fulfil the respective service or if a corresponding authorisation is given. All processors and vicarious agents are contractually obliged (order processing contracts) to maintain data secrecy and to treat your data confidentially and only process it in the context of providing the service.
Blockpit has implemented appropriate security regulations and procedures to protect the stored user data. Sensitive data is not collected. Non-individualisable information is stored and used for the purposes of newsletter advertising or on blockpit.io by Blockpit or its contractual partners. Registered users can also unsubscribe from this advertising using a function on the blockpit.io website.
When?
We process and store your personal data for as long as is necessary for the fulfilment of our contractual and legal obligations, but in any case for the duration of the entire business relationship and beyond in accordance with the statutory retention periods (e.g. 7 years according to the Austrian BAO or UGB; 30 years according to the Austrian ABGB due to warranty and compensation). It is possible to anonymise the data instead of deleting it. In this case, any personal reference is irretrievably removed, which is why the deletion obligations under data protection law no longer apply.
Data Security
Data security is very important to us and we therefore have comprehensive administrative, technical and physical measures in place to protect your personal data from accidental, unlawful or unauthorised destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. These measures comply with the highest international security standards and are regularly reviewed for their effectiveness and suitability to achieve the intended security objectives.
We have implemented the following technical and organisational measures, among others:
SSL encryption of our websites from which we send personal data;
Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of our systems and services;
Use of encrypted systems;
Pseudonymisation and anonymisation of personal data;
Access, entry and transmission control for our offices and systems;
Measures to quickly restore the availability of personal data in the event of a physical or technical incident;
Introduction of procedures for the regular review, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of data processing
Internal IT security guidelines and IT security training;
Incident-response management.
Payment and Subscription Information
You have the option of initiating booking transactions in FIAT or crypto via our services. If this is necessary for the fulfilment of the contract, data will also be transferred to our payment service providers (e.g. Stripe, PayPal, Apple Store, Google Store etc) or the credit institution commissioned to process the payment. The scope of the data is limited to the minimum required for the purpose of processing the contract. Please note, however: Personal data may also be passed on by these third parties to service providers, subcontractors or other affiliated companies if this is necessary to fulfil the contractual obligations arising from your order or if the personal data is to be processed on our behalf.

PayPal assumes the function of an online payment service provider as well as a trustee and offers buyer protection services.

https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full

We need to do this in order to activate the correct licence for you.
Service providers and other third-party services
We use third parties to help us provide and improve our products (e.g. maintenance, analytics, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). These service providers may have access to your browsing data, unless you have disabled this (see cookie statement) and this is necessary to fulfil these tasks on our behalf, and are obliged not to pass it on or use it for other purposes. We use processors such as Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon Web Services, Firstpromoter, Miro, Notion Labs, Zoom, Semrush, Atlassian, Zendesk, Stripe, AdRoll, Zapier, Hotjar & Hubspot .
Data protection rights
Every data subject has the right to information, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, objection and data portability.

Automated decision-making including profiling?
We do not use automated decision-making to establish and conduct the business relationship. Personal aspects are also not evaluated (profiling).
Plugins and widgets for social media
Blockpit uses third-party content on its platform:
https://www.Meta.com/blockpit.io
https://twitter.com/blockpit_io
https://www.instagram.com/blockpit.io/
https://www.linkedin.com/company/18177045/
https://t.me/blockpit
https://reddit.com/r/Blockpit
https://steemit.com/@blockpit
https://medium.com/@blockpit
The social media plugins may collect the user's IP address and the page the user has visited on the blockpit.io platform and they may set up a cookie for the function to work properly. Social media plugins and widgets are either hosted by third parties or directly on our websites and the IP address is transmitted to a third country or within the EU. The user's interaction with these features is subject to the privacy policy of the respective company providing the feature. Blockpit is not responsible for the policies and practices regarding collection, use, disclosure, including data security practices of third parties. Please contact these companies directly to learn about their legal bases and retention periods.
Google Analytics and App Analytics
The Blockpit applications use Google Analytics, a network analysis service from Google Inc ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies" (see this and all cancellation options at https://www.blockpit.io/terms#cookie). The information relating to the visit to a website, including the IP address, is collected by the cookie and usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If a website has activated IP anonymisation, Google first shortens IP addresses from member states of the European Union and EEA states. The full IP address is then, only in exceptional cases, transmitted to the Google server in the USA or Asia and only shortened there. Google uses the information collected on behalf of the website provider to analyse the use of the Blockpit applications, to compile reports on website activity and to provide additional services relating to the Blockpit applications. Under no circumstances will Google link the IP address transmitted by the browser as part of Google Analytics with other Google data.
Your consent allows us to transfer certain data to our partners for processing in countries outside the EU, in particular the USA (e.g. Google Analytics). There is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for the USA and, despite extensive measures, the high EU level of data protection cannot be guaranteed in the USA. There is a risk that transmitted data may not be deleted or further processed for any purpose, that US authorities may have disproportionate access to your data or that you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in the USA. You can also revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. However, rejecting some of these cookies may affect your user experience.
Users can prevent the recording by Google and Google's processing of information regarding the use of the Blockpit platform, including the IP address, by downloading and installing the following browser plugin:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
The Blockpit applications use Google DoubleClick for Publishers ("DFP"). DFP uses cookies to display relevant adverts to the user - the user can find more information about DFP at
https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/2839090?hl=en
. The user can deactivate the setting of cookies by DFP on the following page and thus prevent the display of adverts relevant to the user on the Blockpit platform:
http://www.google.com/ads/preferences
.
Use of Google Recaptcha
Blockpit uses the reCAPTCHA service from Google Inc (Google) to protect your orders via Internet forms. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of reCaptcha and the data required for this purpose are transmitted to Google in the USA. The deviating data protection provisions of Google apply to this data.
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
.
Use of Google Adwords
We also use the Google advertising tool "Google Adwords" to advertise our website. As part of this, we use the "Conversion Tracking" analysis service of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter "Google", on our website. If you have reached our website via a Google advert, a cookie will be stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser places and stores on your computer. These so-called "conversion cookies" lose their validity after 30 days and are not used to identify you personally. If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can recognise that you as a user have clicked on one of our ads placed on Google and have been redirected to our site. The information collected with the help of "conversion cookies" is used by Google to compile visit statistics for our website. These statistics tell us the total number of users who have clicked on our advert and also which pages of our website were subsequently accessed by the respective user. However, we or other Google AdWords advertisers do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users. You can prevent the installation of "conversion cookies" by adjusting your browser settings accordingly, for example by using a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies or specifically blocks only cookies from the domain "googleadservices.com".

Use of Meta
We may use components of the provider facebook.com on our website. Facebook is a service of Meta Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. Each time you access our website, which is equipped with such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component from Meta. This process informs Meta which specific page of our website you are currently visiting. If you visit our site while you are logged in to Meta, Meta recognises which specific page you are visiting through the information collected by the component and assigns this information to your personal account on Meta. For example, if you click on the "Like" button or make comments, this information is transmitted to your personal user account on Meta and stored there. In addition, the information that you have visited our site is passed on to Meta. This happens regardless of whether you click on the component or not. If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data about you and your behaviour on our website by Meta, you must log out of Meta before you visit our site. Meta's privacy policy provides more detailed information on this, in particular on the collection and use of data by Meta, your rights in this regard and the setting options for protecting your privacy:

You can find an overview of the meta plugins at
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/
Use of Twitter
We may use components of the provider Twitter on our website. Twitter is a service of Twitter Inc, 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. Each time you access our website, which is equipped with such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component from Twitter. This process informs Twitter which specific page of our website is currently being visited. We have no influence over the data that Twitter collects in this way, nor over the scope of this data collected by Twitter. To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of the respective website accessed and the IP address of the user, but does not use it for purposes other than displaying the Twitter component. Further information on this can be found in Twitter's privacy policy at
http://twitter.com/privacy
.
You can change your privacy settings in the account settings at

Use of YouTube components with extended data protection mode
We may use components (videos) from YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave, 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, a company of Google Inc, Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, on our website. We use the " - extended data protection mode - " option provided by YouTube. When you access a page that has an embedded video, a connection to the YouTube servers is established and the content is displayed on the website by notifying your browser. According to YouTube, in " - extended data protection mode -" only data is transmitted to the YouTube server, in particular which of our Internet pages you have visited when you watch the video. If you are logged in to YouTube at the same time, this information will be assigned to your YouTube member account. You can prevent this by logging out of your member account before visiting our website. Further information on YouTube's data protection is provided under the following link:

Access data / server log files
Blockpit (or its web space provider) collects data about every access to the website (so-called server log files). The access data includes: Name of the website accessed, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider. The provider uses the log data only for statistical evaluations for the purpose of operation, security and optimisation of the website. However, the provider reserves the right to check the log data retrospectively if there is a justified suspicion of unlawful use based on concrete evidence.
Deletion of user data
If a registered user's account is terminated, all personal data provided by the respective user upon registration will be deactivated. All data collected from the user will be (i) anonymised, i.e. it will be visible that this information originates from a deleted account, or (ii) in the event of the deletion of an account, deleted within 30 days, provided that there are no legal storage obligations or legitimate interests of Blockpit to the contrary and, at the request of this Registered User, all user data which is no longer required for the fulfilment of the contract by Blockpit or which must be stored due to legal requirements will be irrevocably deleted. Such a request for deletion must be made by e-mail to support@blockpit.io, stating the e-mail address provided during registration. Blockpit will fulfil this request immediately.

This allows websites to be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the Cookie was stored, whereby the identification of a certain person is usually only possible with certain third-party tools.
You have the option, at any time, to reject the activation of specific Cookies by selecting the corresponding option in the browser settings or in the Cookie Settings.
Consent to the use of Cookies and to the transfer to third countries (e.g., USA)
Cookies that are not absolutely necessary to provide you with the services on our website (so-called "Necessary Cookies") are only used upon your consent. In some cases, such "Optional Cookies" are also operated by entities that process data in third countries, in particular in the USA (e.g., Google Ireland Ltd. through its data processor Google LLC).
By agreeing to the use of Cookies from such providers, you also expressly consent to the transfer of your data to third countries, such as the USA (pursuant to Art 49 (1) lit a GDPR).
Your consent also allows us to transfer certain data to our partners for processing in countries outside the EU, such as the USA (e.g., Google Analytics). There is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for the USA and despite extensive measures, the high level of EU data protection in the USA cannot be guaranteed. There are risks that transmitted data may not be deleted or further processed for any purpose, that there may be disproportionate access to your data by US authorities or that you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in the US. However, you are welcome to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. However, rejecting some of these cookies may affect your user experience.

What types of Cookies are there?
In order to better understand why Cookies are so important, we will give you a brief overview of what types of Cookies there are:
Necessary Cookies

Therefore, no consent is required for such Necessary Cookies (Art 6 para 1 lit f GDPR). For this reason, Necessary Cookies cannot be individually deactivated or activated. However, you have the option to generally deactivate cookies in your browser at any time (see Section 5.).
Necessary Cookies are provided by us or by third parties whose services are implemented by us on our website. Necessary Cookies are used, for example, to ensure that you remain logged in as a registered user when accessing different subpages of our website and therefore do not have to re-enter your login details each time you access a new subpage.
Advertisement Cookies
are used to provide website visitors with relevant advertising and marketing campaigns. These Cookies record the pages a user visits on different websites and collect information to deliver tailored advertising. They help us to use information collected on the website for the best possible user experience and also for additional marketing purposes. Most Advertisement Cookies come from external advertising companies (Third Party Cookies) and are Persistent Cookies. As a result, this type of Cookie is also called a "Targeting Cookie". The second type of Cookies that fall into this category are used for performance purposes, as they generally make the website more pleasant to use and improve marketing messages. There are also ways to share content with a community, such as blog posts or interact between a website and a social media channel. These cookies are known as "Interaction Cookies".
If we process personal data in the context of Advertisement Cookies, we may only do so on the basis of your consent (Art 6 (1) (a) GDPR) and only as long as you have not deactivated the respective performance cookie; you can do this at any time with effect for the future (see point 5.).
Functional Cookies
enable our website to store information you have already provided (e.g., language selection) and to offer you improved and more personalized functions based on such information. These Cookies collect and store mostly anonymous information so that they cannot track your behavior on other websites. If we should process personal data, we may do so either because of our legitimate interest in operating a functional website (Art 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or because of your consent (Art 6 (1) (a) GDPR), but only as long as you have not deactivated the respective Functional Cookie; you can do this at any time with effect for the future (see point 5.).
Performance Cookies
are used to understand and analyze key website metrics, which helps to provide a better user experience for visitors. Amongst others, we record the number of hits, the time spent on our website, the number of sub-pages accessed, the order of pages visited, which search terms led you to us, the location from which access is made, and the proportion of mobile devices accessing our websites. We also record movements, mouse clicks and scrolling behavior in order to understand which areas of our website are of particular interest to you. If we process personal data within the scope of these Cookies, we may only do so on the basis of your consent (Art 6 (1) (a) GDPR) and only as long as you have not deactivated the respective Performance Cookie; you can do this at any time with effect for the future (see point 5.).

Some Cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of the website, others are optional and are, for example, sent to our partners for marketing purposes. These partners may combine your information with data that you have provided to them or that they have collected as part of other services.

Who we are
Who is providing this notice?
Stripe, Inc., Stripe Payments Company, and their affiliates that provide consumers services in the U.S.
What we do
How does Stripe protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse we use security measures to comply with federal law.  These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.  We impose access controls along with ongoing monitoring to prevent data misuse, and we require our service providers to take similar steps to protect your information.
How does Stripe collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
• open a Link account;
• ask Stripe to process a payment for goods or services;
• provide bank account information to Stripe using Financial Connections
We also collect your personal information from others, such as affiliates or other companies.
Why can’t I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
• sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
• affiliates from using your information to market to you
• sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you.
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See the Other Important Information section below for more information on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.

Privacy Policy

Privacy Center

App privacy details on the App Store
The App Store helps people better understand an app’s privacy practices before they download the app on any Apple platform. On each app’s product page, users can learn about some of the data types the app may collect, and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them. You’ll need to provide information about your app’s privacy practices, including the practices of third-party partners whose code you integrate into your app, in App Store Connect. This information is required to submit new apps and app updates to the App Store.

What’s new
An important part of submitting your app to the App Store is explaining how your app handles user data. Two new updates make it easier to accurately provide Privacy Nutrition Labels and improve the integrity of the software supply chain: signatures for third-party SDKs and privacy manifests. In addition, we’re adding more data type options to use in your Privacy Nutrition Label when describing what types of data your app collects.

Answering app privacy questions
As you get ready to select your answers from the options presented in App Store Connect, keep in mind:
You need to identify all of the data you or your third-party partners collect, unless the data meets all of the criteria for optional disclosure listed below.
Your app’s privacy practices should follow the App Review Guidelines and all applicable laws.
You’re responsible for keeping your responses accurate and up to date. If your practices change, update your responses in App Store Connect. You may update your answers at any time, and you do not need to submit an app update in order to change your answers.
Account Holders, Admins, and App Managers can
learn how to enter their responses
in App Store Connect.
Data collection
The purpose of the label is to help your customers understand what data is collected from your app and how it is used. To complete that, you’ll need to know the types of data that you and/or your third-party partners collect from your app before answering the questions in App Store Connect. Keep in mind that even if you collect the data for reasons other than analytics or advertising, it still needs to be declared. For example, if you collect data solely for the purpose of app functionality, declare the data on your label and indicate that it is only being used for that purpose.
“Collect” refers to transmitting data off the device in a way that allows you and/or your third-party partners to access it for a period longer than what is necessary to service the transmitted request in real time.
“Third-party partners” refers to analytics tools, advertising networks, third-party SDKs, or other external vendors whose code you’ve added to your app.
Optional disclosure
Data types that meet all of the following criteria are optional to disclose:
The data is not used for tracking purposes, meaning the data is not linked with Third-Party Data for advertising or advertising measurement purposes, or shared with a data broker. For details, see the
Tracking
section.
The data is not used for Third-Party Advertising, your Advertising or Marketing purposes, or for Other Purposes, as those terms are defined in the
Tracking
section.
Collection of the data occurs only in infrequent cases that are not part of your app’s primary functionality, and which are optional for the user.
The data is provided by the user in your app’s interface, it is clear to the user what data is collected, the user’s name or account name is prominently displayed in the submission form alongside the other data elements being submitted, and the user affirmatively chooses to provide the data for collection each time.
Data types must meet all criteria in order to be considered optional for disclosure. If a data type collected by your app meets some, but not all, of the above criteria, it must be disclosed in App Store Connect.
Examples of data that may not need to be disclosed include data collected in optional feedback forms or customer service requests that are unrelated to the primary purpose of the app and meet the other criteria above.
For the purpose of clarity, data collected on an ongoing basis after an initial request for permission must be disclosed.
Regulated Financial Services Disclosure
Data types that are collected by an app that facilitates regulated financial services and where the data collected meets all of the following criteria are optional to disclose:
Collection of the regulated data is in accordance with a legally required privacy notice under applicable financial services or data protection laws or regulations (e.g., GDPR or GLBA).
Collection by the app of that data occurs only in cases that are not part of your app’s primary functionality, and which are optional for the user.
Such notice provides that data is not shared with unaffiliated third parties to market other products and services.
Such data is not linked with third-party data for advertising purposes or shared with a data broker except for purposes of fraud detection or prevention or security purposes, or with a consumer reporting agency for credit reporting.
Data types must meet all criteria in order to be considered optional for disclosure. If a data type collected by your app meets some, but not all, of the above criteria, it must be disclosed in your privacy section.
Health Research Disclosure
Data types that are collected as part of a health research study and where the data collected meets all of the following criteria are optional to disclose:
The data is collected by an entity whose collection of the data is subject to an informed consent form (ICF) as part of a health research study that has been reviewed and approved by an institutional review board or ethics review board.
All such data collection must follow the relevant App Review Guidelines and the data may not be used for tracking purposes.
If the data type collected by your app meets some, but not all, of the above criteria, it must be disclosed in your privacy section.

Any other purposes not listed
Data linked to the user
You’ll need to identify whether each data type is linked to the user’s identity (via their account, device, or other details) by you and/or your third-party partners. Data collected from an app is often linked to the user’s identity, unless specific privacy protections are put in place before collection to de-identify or anonymize it, such as:
Stripping data of any direct identifiers, such as user ID or name, before collection.
Manipulating data to break the linkage and prevent re-linkage to real-world identities.
Additionally, in order for data not to be linked to a particular user’s identity, you must avoid certain activities after collection:
You must not attempt to link the data back to the user’s identity.
You must not tie the data to other datasets that enable it to be linked to a particular user’s identity.
Note: “Personal Information” and “Personal Data”, as defined under relevant privacy laws, are considered linked to the user.
Tracking
You’ll need to understand whether you and/or your third-party partners use data from your app to track users and, if so, which data is used for this purpose.
“Tracking” refers to linking data collected from your app about a particular end-user or device, such as a user ID, device ID, or profile, with Third-Party Data for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, or sharing data collected from your app about a particular end-user or device with a data broker.
“Third-Party Data” refers to any data about a particular end-user or device collected from apps, websites, or offline properties not owned by you.
Examples of tracking include:
Displaying targeted advertisements in your app based on user data collected from apps and websites owned by other companies.
Sharing device location data or email lists with a data broker.
Sharing a list of emails, advertising IDs, or other IDs with a third-party advertising network that uses that information to retarget those users in other developers’ apps or to find similar users.
Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency, even if you don’t use the SDK for these purposes. For example, using a login SDK that repurposes the data it collects from your app to enable targeted advertising in other developers’ apps.
The following situations are not considered tracking:
When the data is linked solely on the end-user’s device and is not sent off the device in a way that can identify the end-user or device.
When the data broker uses the data shared with them solely for fraud detection or prevention or security purposes.
When the data broker is a consumer reporting agency and the data is shared with them for purposes of (1) reporting on a consumer’s creditworthiness or (2) obtaining information on a consumer’s creditworthiness for the specific purpose of making a credit determination.

.
Privacy links
By adding the following links on your product page, you can help users easily access your app’s privacy policy and manage their data in your app.
Privacy Policy (Required):
The URL to your publicly accessible privacy policy.
Privacy Choices (Optional):
A publicly accessible URL where users can learn more about their privacy choices for your app and how to manage them. For example, a webpage where users can access their data, request deletion, or make changes.
Additional guidance
Your app has web views.
Data collected via web traffic must be declared, unless you are enabling the user to navigate the open web.
You collect and store IP address from your users.
Declare the relevant data types based on how you use IP address, such as precise location, coarse location, device ID, or diagnostics.
You offer in-app private messaging between users that are not SMS text messages.
Declare emails or text messages on your label. Text messages refer to both SMS and non-SMS messages.
Your app includes game saves, multiplayer matching, or gameplay logic.
Declare Gameplay Content on your label.
You collect different types of data from users depending on whether the user is a child, whether they are a free or paid user, whether they opt in, where they live, or for some other reason.
Please disclose all data collected from your app, unless it meets all of the criteria outlined in the Optional Disclosure section. You may use the Privacy Choices or Privacy Policy links to provide additional detail about how your data collection practices may vary.
You use Apple frameworks or services, such as MapKit, CloudKit, or App Analytics.
If you collect data about your app from Apple frameworks or services, you should indicate what data you collect and how you use it. You are not responsible for disclosing data collected by Apple.
You use location, device identifiers, and other sensitive data, but only on device, and the data is never sent to a server.
Data that is processed only on device is not “collected” and does not need to be disclosed in your answers. If you derive anything from that data and send it off device, the resulting data should be considered separately.
You collect precise location, but immediately de-identify and coarsen it before storing.
Disclose that you collect Coarse Location, since the precise location data is immediately coarsened and precise location is not stored.
Your app includes free-form text fields or voice recordings, and users can save any type of information they want through those mediums, including names and health data.
Mark "Other User Content" to represent generic free form text fields and "Audio Data" for voice recordings. You’re not responsible for disclosing all possible data that users may manually enter in the app through free-form fields or voice recordings. However, if you ask a user to input a specific data type into a text field, such as their name or email, or if you have a feature that enables users to upload a particular media type, such as photos or videos, then you’ll need to disclose the specific type of data.
You collect data to service a request but do not retain it after servicing the request.
"Collect" refers to transmitting data off the device and storing it in a readable form for longer than the time it takes you and/or your third-party partners to service the request. For example, if an authentication token or IP address is sent on a server call and not retained, or if data is sent to your servers then immediately discarded after servicing the request, you do not need to disclose this in your answers in App Store Connect.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.

from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

PayPal Privacy Statement
Last updated on February 13, 2025
Overview
PayPal, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “PayPal”) provides this Privacy Statement to describe our use of your Personal Information when you use your PayPal account, Xoom account, visit our websites, or apply for, or use our Services, like Braintree and Zettle. This Privacy Statement does not apply to Excluded Services, such as Venmo and Hyperwallet.
We encourage you to read this Privacy Statement and to use it to help you make informed decisions.
Certain capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in the Statement are explained in the
Definitions
section below.
We revise this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes to our business, Services, or applicable laws. If the revised version requires notice in accordance with applicable law, we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the change on the "
Policy Updates
" or "
Privacy Statement
" page of our website, otherwise the revised Privacy Statement will be effective as of the published effective date. If you are a new User or are receiving this Privacy Statement for the first time and there is an upcoming change described on the
Policy Updates
or Privacy Statement page at the time you receive this Privacy Statement, such upcoming change will apply to you on the indicated effective date.
For most of our Services, we act as a “data controller” or “business”, however there are some products and features where PayPal may also act as a “data processor” or “service provider” when providing services to our Partners and Merchants.  The “data controller” or “business” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that has the control over the purposes and means by which the data processing is performed.  The “data processor” or “service provider” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that processes the Personal Information for the data controller, for the data controller’s specific purposes, and as otherwise permitted under applicable data protection laws.
Non-Account Holders and Fastlane Profile Users
Our Services may be accessed by individuals without a PayPal or Xoom account. We will collect Personal Information from you even if you are a non-account holder when you use our Services, such as when you use our Pay Without a PayPal account, use Unbranded Payment Services (e.g., Braintree and Zettle), use a Fastlane profile, or when a non-accountholder receives a payment through the Visa+ service from a PayPal account holder (“Recipient”). If you Pay Without a PayPal account, we may link your transaction information with your PayPal account, if you have one at the time you use the Service without logging in, or if you create a PayPal account later.
With a Fastlane profile, individuals can store their payment methods and other Personal Information with PayPal so that they can complete the checkout process faster,  create a store or loyalty account, or facilitate other transactions at participating Partners and Merchants with payment card, contact information, shipping data or other data they save in their Fastlane profile as relevant to the specific interaction, participating Partner or Merchant, all without having to manually input payment method details and other Personal Information each time they checkout ("Fastlane").
When you create a Fastlane profile, you are agreeing to let PayPal store your Personal Information, including your name, email, phone number, address information, billing information and payment method details, and other data that may be relevant to specific Partner or Merchant interactions, and pre-populate that information in the checkout flows or other interactive features of participating Partners and Merchants so that you can  enjoy a faster Partner and Merchant experience by not having to manually input  your payment or other information. We will also collect transaction and other Partner or Merchant data related to your purchases and other Partner or Merchant interactions when you use Fastlane. If you have a Fastlane profile, we may recognize you as a Fastlane user when you shop on the participating Partners’ and Merchants’ sites, and we may prompt you to engage in participating Partner or Merchant interactions, such as registering for a store or loyalty account using your Fastlane profile information. If you choose to interact with participating Partners or Merchants through Fastlane, you agree to let PayPal disclose your Fastlane profile information to the Participating Partners and Merchants and their service providers, and to facilitate your transaction and shopping experience on the participating Partners and Merchants sites.
The Visa+ Service enables eligible customers with a PayPal account to send and receive money to and from Venmo and third-party Visa+-enabled digital wallets (“Visa+”).
When you shop on Partner and Merchant sites, the Partner or Merchant may disclose Personal Information with PayPal that we will use in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the relevant PayPal user agreement.

Your Data Protection Rights

We recognize the importance of your ability to control the use of your Personal Information and provide several ways for you to exercise your rights to access (right to know your information), right to know third-parties to which we have disclosed Personal Information, correction, deletion (erasure), and to restrict certain information (right to opt-out of sharing and right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information).
Certain state laws also provide residents of those states with the right to opt out of the “sale” (disclosing Personal Information in exchange for money or other consideration) or “sharing” (disclosing Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising) of your Personal Information or use of your Personal Information for certain types of targeted advertising.  Global Privacy Control settings is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. PayPal does not respond to the Global Privacy Control signal because we do not sell or share your data.
We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights; although, certain personalized services for PayPal customers may not provide the same level of personalization with limited data sharing. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we handle your
Privacy Rights
.
How do you exercise your rights?
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information,
contact us
or submit your request from your account settings. If you have a PayPal account, you can exercise your privacy rights by accessing “Data and Privacy” from account settings in the PayPal app.

Even if you do not have a PayPal account (for example, where you use Pay without a PayPal account), you can submit a request for access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at the number provided in our
Contact Information
section.
We’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.

Understanding your choices
You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.
Choose how we collect Personal Information
You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function.
For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.
Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information
If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.
You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.
Choose what we disclose with other Users
Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.

If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.

CCPA California Notice at Collection
Most of the Personal Information we collect is subject to federal and state privacy laws that apply to financial institutions. To the extent the Personal Information is not subject to these federal and state financial privacy laws and to the extent it is collected in California about California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may apply. The following section pertains only to Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA (“CCPA personal information”) and makes statements that reference unique definitions and requirements of law.
This CCPA California Notice at Collection describes: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “CCPA personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose CCPA personal information for a business purpose, and/or (b) “share” CCPA personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or (c) “sell” such CCPA personal information, as applicable.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the sharing or disclosure of CCPA personal information by a business to a third party, for the targeting of advertising to a consumer, based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s CCPA activity across businesses, websites, applications, or services, other than those with which a consumer uses or directs a business to internally disclose CCPA personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties. “Selling” is defined as the disclosure of CCPA personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, but does not apply to such disclosures when a consumer uses or directs a business to intentionally disclose CCPA personal information or interact with one or more third parties.
We do not sell or share your CCPA personal information, including any Sensitive CCPA personal information, outside the exceptions.
We also do not sell or share, and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any CCPA personal information of anyone under 16 years of age.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose CCPA personal information, please see the “Categories of Personal Information We Collect”, “How is Personal Information used,” and “Do We Disclose Personal Information” sections.

How to stop Facebook from tracking you across the web
Writer
:
Paul Bischoff
Tech Writer, Privacy Advocate and VPN Expert
Updated:
March 25, 2022
Whether or not you have a Facebook account, Facebook knows a lot about you. Even if you don’t frequent the world’s largest social network,
chances are you do visit websites that contain Facebook widgets
. These widgets–Like and Share buttons, Recommended lists, and comment sections–aren’t just simple hyperlinks. They contain code that transmits data back to Facebook and
plants a tracking cookie into your browser.
That cookie stays with you even after you leave the page where you picked it up. Whenever you go to another web page with a Facebook widget–and a lot of sites have those widgets these days–the widget sees the cookie and takes notes. Those notes include
the web page you visited, what browser you use, your approximate location, and what language you read in
, among other data. The notes are transmitted back to Facebook via the widget.
Tracking cookies can stick around in your browser indefinitely
if not deleted
, slowly amassing
a detailed record of articles you’ve read, items you’ve shopped for, and what forums you frequent,
among other info. To reiterate, you do not need to be a member of Facebook for such tracking to take place.
With that information in hand,
Facebook can now target you with ads
. Again, this does not require you to have a Facebook account. In May 2016, the company announced the
launch of Audience Network
, an online advertising network that places ads both on and off Facebook. In particular, these ads show up in mobile apps.
If all this sounds a bit too much like corporate Big Brother snooping on your every move, you’re not far off the mark. Many websites need Facebook in order to reach a larger audience, so these social widgets are now so common that it can seem futile to try and avoid them. And it’s not just Facebook; Twitter, Google, Disqus, and other social networks use many of the same tactics.
Instead of avoiding pages that contain Facebook widgets altogether, why not just block the page elements that contain those widgets? Great idea! In this tutorial, we’ll show you a few ways to minimize social widget tracking and opt out of Facebook’s most invasive data collection.
Facebook Blocker is discontinued. Try Ad Block Plus instead
Until recently, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and Chrome users could use the Facebook Blocker browser extension to prevent Facebook widgets from loading. Unfortunately, this tool has been discontinued. But don’t worry, there are plenty of easy ways to accomplish the same result.
Preventing widgets from loading not only protects your privacy, it improves page load times. You can still use the actual Facebook app and websites as usual. This only affects external sites.
Plenty of Chrome extensions and Firefox plugins claim to do the same thing as Facebook Blocker did, but we’re going to use something a bit more general-purpose: Adblock Plus. Why? Because it’s very popular and has thus undergone enough scrutiny to know that it’s trustworthy, and because it’s regularly maintained. It works the same across all supported browsers, and it shows no signs of being discontinued in the foreseeable future. Finally, many of our readers already use it, so this will save you adding clutter to your browser (and potentially an additional attack vector).
Here’s how to use Ad Block Plus to block Facebook widgets:
Download and install
Adblock Plus
on your browser (
Chrome
,
Firefox
) for free. Make sure you get ABP and not “Adblock” or “Adblocker”, which are separate extensions from different publishers.
In Chrome, Click the ABP icon to open its menu and click
Options
. In FF, go to
Tools > AdBlock Plus Preferences
In the next page, on the
Filter Lists
tabs, click the button that says
Add filter subscription
Click the dropdown menu and choose the last option to
Add a different subscription
In the
Subscription title
field, enter
Fanboy’s Social Blocking List
In the
Filter list location
field, enter the following URL:
https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/fanboy-social.txt
Click the
+ Add
button and wait for the filter list to download
Click the
Add your own filters
tab
Copy and paste the following lines exactly as they appear one at a time, hitting the
Add filter
button after each.
To block Facebook widgets:
||facebook.com/plugins/*
||connect.facebook.com
||connect.facebook.net
To block Twitter widgets:
||platform.twitter.com
That’s it! You can close out the ABP settings and the changes should take effect immediately. Note that the filter list we’re using, Fanboy’s Social Blocking List, blocks almost all social media widgets across the board. If you would like to allow some of those through, you can edit the list and remove them as you please, or try a different list. If you like Fanboy’s list, you can
donate to the project on their home page
.
If there are sites where you’d like to keep the widgets turned on, you can add them to the
Whitelisted domains
list in the next tab over.
Opt out
The widget-blocking method above should work pretty much everywhere across the web, but it’s always good to opt out of interest-based advertising and tracking when possible.
Facebook users
can opt out of Audience Network by going to
this link
. Log in if necessary. Click
Edit
next to the item that says
Ads on apps and websites off of the Facebook Companies
. A bunch of text will appear explaining how these ads work. Click the drop down menu at the bottom of this text and select
No
. Then hit the
Close
button where previously it read Edit.
While you’re on this page, you can go ahead and opt out of the rest of Facebook’s optional advertising schemes as well.
Non-Facebook users
don’t have the option to opt out on Facebook, so you’ll have to use other means. You can enable Do Not Track in your browser and
opt out
of interest-based advertising from all companies, including Facebook, that are part of the Digital Advertising Alliance.
You can learn more about how to opt out of ad tracking from the largest ad networks in next week’s tutorial.

How to improve your privacy and security on Facebook
Use a VPN
Up to this point, we’ve mainly demonstrated how to prevent Facebook planting tracking cookies in your browser and opt out where possible. But you can still be tracked across the web using your IP address.
An IP address is a string of numbers and decimals unique to your device, and indeed every device connected to the internet. It looks something like this:
123.213.132.32
Or, if you’re using the new IPv6 protocol:
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Because it’s unique, it can be used to identify your device and approximate your location. That makes
hiding your IP address
an imperative for anyone who doesn’t want to be tracked online.
The best way to mask your IP address is with a VPN. Short for Virtual Private Network, a VPN encrypts all of a device’s internet traffic and routes it through an intermediary server in a location of your choosing. Once connected to the VPN, your real IP address will be masked by that of the VPN server.
Our top recommendation is
ExpressVPN
. With rock-solid security, an easy-to-use app, and fast speeds, it’s a great all-around VPN provider that will work well for
Windows
,
Mac
,
Linux
,
Android
and
iPhone
users.
The extra encryption also prevents your ISP and any attackers on your local network from monitoring your online activity. As an added bonus, VPNs can be used to bypass web censorship in countries such as
China
and the
UAE
and unblock geographically restricted content online.

X Privacy Policy
Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:
X is a public platform
Learn what’s viewable & searchable
We collect some data
about you
Learn what we collect & how
Affiliate services may have their own policies
Learn about affiliates
We use your data to make X better
Learn how we make your info work
You can control your experience
Learn how to update your settings
If you have questions about how we use data, just ask

10. How To Contact X
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us.
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
Personal Accounts.
If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
Professional Accounts.
If you create a
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.
Payment Information.
In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
Preferences.
When you set your preferences using your
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
Biometric Information.
Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.
Job Applications / Recommendations.
We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your activity on X, including:
Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.
We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).
Purchase and payments.
To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
Device Information.
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:
Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.
Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.
Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information.
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.
Inferred Identity.
We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:
When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.
When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.
Log Information.
We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:
IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identiﬁers; and identiﬁers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.
Advertisements.
When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).
Cookies and similar technologies.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.
3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether
videos you upload
are downloadable by others.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates
and third-party partners and
service providers
located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.
X is a
participant
in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us
here
. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body
JAMS
, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in
Annex 1
to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF
