Collecting and using personal information
Welcome to Aetna International. We appreciate your interest in us. As you navigate our secure mobile app and communicate with us via this app, we may ask you to disclose certain personal information so that we can provide you with the highest quality information and services. In order for you to make an informed decision about whether to disclose your personal information to us via this app, we are providing you with the following information about how we collect and use personal information. By "personal information," we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number.
We may use personal information for the following purposes:
a) verifying your identity so that we can be sure that all of our communications with you are secure and confidential,
b) responding to inquiries or requests from you.
We will not collect personal information about you unless you provide us that information voluntarily.
Your e-mail
We welcome your comments or questions about our mobile app and have provided e-mail boxes for that purpose.We will share your comments and questions with our customer service representatives and those employees most capable of addressing your questions and concerns.
Please note that your e-mail, like most, if not all, non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications, may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use e-mail to communicate information to us that you consider confidential. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the numbers provided at various locations on our app or, in the case of our health plan members, at the Member Services toll-free number that appears on your ID card.

We may also provide links to other websites that are controlled by an Aetna-owned company, but that operate independently of Aetna.com. Privacy policies applicable to those sites will appear on those sites and may differ from this Privacy Statement.
