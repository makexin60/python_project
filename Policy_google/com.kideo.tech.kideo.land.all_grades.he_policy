The application is available for use by users at the site

Registration Time:
In order to let the pupil use the app, the school must provide the company with the pupil's personal details (first name, last name, father's name, gender, and date of birth) ("Personal Details"). The company creates a user account for each pupil (with a username and a password) which will give the pupil a permission to log into the app. The school will then provide the pupil with a username and a password which were created for him/ her to use when s/he logs into his personal account of the app.
The user, through a parent or a guardian, hereby agrees that the company will collect the personal details of the pupil from the school to use them as previously stated in this policy.

Communication and uploading content
The app allows pupils to manage a direct communication channel between them and their respective school teachers, as need arises.
The app allows the pupil, upon request from the teacher, to upload content, including photos and short videos ("Content") which will be transmitted to the teacher through the app as part of the tasks/ quizzes/ assignments that the pupils will be required to do.
Parents must ensure that pupils don't upload any personal content or any other sensitive content, and that the uploaded contents are appropriate for their target audience, and that they don't harm any pupil or any other user.Â  It is a greed and clarified that the Company has no control over the content uploaded by the pupils, and thus users, schools, parents and guardians, exempt the Company from any responsibility over content uploaded by the users, including any damage, expense, loss, or any other result of uploaded content by users.
In addition, the Company is not responsible for any details of the rights of the intellectual property, including details of third-party privacy rights.Â  This is also true for content uploaded to the app by users who violate such rights.
Users are not legally obliged to provide us with the content. The Company, however, Â reserves the right to itself to Â remove or delete, or even report to the relevant parties, Â a content that is not consistent with this privacy policy or terms of use of the app, and this is to the sole decision of the Company. However, the Company has no obligation to monitor the content and/ or the content and /or not approve its upload; and if it does so, there is no obligation to be set upon it to do so.
Cookies
When the student uses the app, we may use industry-standard technologies such as "Cookies" (or similar technologies), which store certain information on the device from which the app is used and make the pupil's browsing more convenient. A "cookie" is a small text file that is transferred to a device from which the pupil will use the application. The purpose of using a cookie is that Kideo servers can quickly and efficiently identify the user when he or she uses the application again. One can change the browser settings that the pupil will be asked for 'cookies' approval each time individually, or alternatively refuse them all together. Most browsers allow the user to delete cookies from their computer's hard drive, block cookies or receive a warning before saving a cookie. However, if users block or delete cookies, their online experience in the app may be limited and they may not be able to use certain parts of the features in the app. We may use a "persistent" cookie to store users settings and personalized settings.
Google Data Analysis
We use Google Analytics to collect analytical information about the user's use of the application. This tool collects the user's IP address, device type, language of use, duration of activation, content the user have visited in the application, user interface clicks, frequency and extent of use of the application. We process Analytics' aggregate information to understand how users interact with the app so we can develop and improve it. We will share the Analytics data with service providers, who assist us in the internal operation of the application. These companies are only allowed to use the personal information of the users as needed to provide us with these services and not for their purposes. The Analytics information we collect using a third-party tool is only used to support the internal operation of the application, i.e. to maintain and develop the application. The Analytics information we process is aggregate information that we ourselves cannot attribute to a specific user. We do not combine information collected using Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.
