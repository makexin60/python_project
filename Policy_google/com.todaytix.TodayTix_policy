10.9.  Opt-Out Preference Signals.
In addition to the advertising opt-out options above, we capture opt out preference signals, and to the extent users have rights under applicable law, treat them as valid requests to opt out of sale/sharing at the browser level. An opt-out preference signal is a setting or extension in a browser or device that a web user sets to prevent the selling or sharing of personal information on sites the browser or device visits. We will process your signal as a request to opt information associated with your device, browser, and/or consumer profile out of selling and sharing with third parties.

Adyen

We also require you to enter a password to access your account. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, we cannot and do not guarantee its absolute security.
12. Non-Discrimination.
Providing your Personal Data may be a requirement necessary to enter into or to perform a contract, including for the performance of the Services, and replying to and managing requests for information, questions, communication, or feedback. In such circumstances, refusal to provide your Personal Data would make it impossible for us to perform the contract or to provide the requested Services. However, providing your Personal Data for marketing purposes alone is optional; refusal to provide your Personal Data for marketing purposes will not have any impact on the performance of our Services.
13. Changes to This Privacy Policy.
