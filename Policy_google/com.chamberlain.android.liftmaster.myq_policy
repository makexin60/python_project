Cookies Used on the Services
We and certain third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags,

 or mobile advertisements, and may use such information to allow CG to keep
 track of analytics and certain statistical information that enables us to
 improve our Sites and Apps and provide you with more relevant content and
 advertising on our Sites, Apps, or other websites or mobile applications.
 Our Services use single-session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent)
 cookies. Temporary cookies last only as long as your web browser is open
 and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation on
 our Services. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.
 Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods and are
 used for purposes, which include tracking the number of unique visitors to
 our Services and information such as the number of views a page gets, how
 much time a user spends on a page, and other pertinent web statistics. If

 browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to delete cookies); however, you must
 enable cookies to access certain information on our Sites and/or Apps.
Various browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari,
 currently offer a "Do Not Track" or "DNT" option that relies on a
 technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited
 by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Our system may
 not respond to Do Not Track requests or headers from some or all browsers.
 Certain parts of our Sites and/or Apps may also include advertisements from
 third parties. You can opt out of being targeted by certain third-party
 ad-servers and CG served ads online using the National Advertising
 Initiative’s opt-out tool, the About Ads opt-out tool. To learn more about
 the use of cookies or other technologies to deliver more relevant
 advertising and to know your choices about not having this information used
 by third-party advertisers, please visit

We use the function 'anonymizeIP' (so-called IP-Masking). If IP
 anonymization is activated on the Sites and Apps, your IP address will be
 truncated within the EEA. Only in exceptional cases will the whole IP
 address first be transferred to a server in the United States and truncated
 there. The IP anonymization is active on the Sites and Apps. The IP address

Your approximate location (region);
Your IP address (in abbreviated form);
Technical information about your browser and the end devices you use
 (e.g., language settings, screen resolution);
Your internet provider; and
The referrer URL (the website/advertising medium from which you came to
 this website).
On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your
 (pseudonymous) use of our Sites and Apps to compile reports on the
 activities. The reports provided by Google Analytics are used to analyze
 the performance of our Sites and Apps.
The recipient of the data is Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,

 out.

 States or other countries outside the EEA. For more information about the
 safeguards implemented with Google for international data transfers, please

As from the Terms Effective Date, Google will implement and maintain the Security Measures set out in this Appendix 2. Google may update or modify such Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Processor Services.
1.
Data Centre & Network Security
(a)
Data Centres
.
Infrastructure
. Google maintains geographically distributed data centres. Google stores all production data in physically secure data centres.
Redundancy
. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimise the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Dual circuits, switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. The Processor Services are designed to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and corrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer's or internal specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data centre equipment is scheduled through a standard process according to documented procedures.
Power
. The data centre electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. In most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, each with equal capacity, is provided for critical infrastructure components in the data centre. Backup power is provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide transitory power to the data centre, at full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the backup generator systems take over. The backup generators are capable of automatically starting up within seconds to provide enough emergency electrical power to run the data centre at full capacity typically for a period of days.
Server Operating Systems
. Google servers use hardened operating systems which are customised for the unique server needs of the business. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms to augment data security and redundancy. Google employs a code review process to increase the security of the code used to provide the Processor Services and enhance the security products in production environments.
Business Continuity
. Google replicates data over multiple systems to help to protect against accidental destruction or loss. Google has designed and regularly plans and tests its business continuity planning/disaster recovery programs.
Encryption Technologies
. Google’s security policies mandate encryption at rest for all user data, including personal data. Data is often encrypted at multiple levels in Google’s production storage stack in data centres, including at the hardware level, without requiring any action by customers. Using multiple layers of encryption adds redundant data protection and allows Google to select the optimal approach based on application requirements. All personal data is encrypted at the storage level, generally using AES256. Google uses common cryptographic libraries which incorporate Google’s FIPS 140-2 validated module, to implement encryption consistently across the Processor Services.
(b)
Networks & Transmission
.
Data Transmission
. Data centres are typically connected via high-speed private links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data centres. Further, Google encrypts data transmitted between data centres. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during electronic transport. Google transfers data via Internet standard protocols.
External Attack Surface
. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external facing systems.
Intrusion Detection
. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google’s intrusion detection involves:
1.
Tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through preventative measures;
2.
Employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and
3.
Employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.
Incident Response
. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.
Encryption Technologies
. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as TLS connection) available. Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA and ECDSA. These perfect forward secrecy (PFS) methods help protect traffic and minimise the impact of a compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough.
2.
Access and Site Controls
(a)
Site Controls
.
On-site Data Centre Security Operation
. Google’s data centres maintain an on-site security operation responsible for all physical data centre security functions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The on-site security operations personnel monitor Closed Circuit TV (“
CCTV
”) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform internal and external patrols of the data centre regularly.
Data Centre Access Procedures
. Google maintains formal access procedures for allowing physical access to the data centres. The data centres are housed in facilities that require electronic card key access, with alarms that are linked to the on-site security operation. All entrants to the data centre are required to identify themselves as well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorised employees, contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centres. Only authorised employees and contractors are permitted to request electronic card key access to these facilities. Data centre electronic card key access requests must be made in advance and in writing, and require the approval of authorised data centre personnel. All other entrants requiring temporary data centre access must: (i) obtain approval in advance from authorised data centre personnel for the specific data centre and internal areas they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an approved data centre access record identifying the individual as approved.
On-site Data Centre Security Devices
. Google’s data centres employ an electronic card key and biometric access control system that is linked to a system alarm. The access control system monitors and records each individual’s electronic card key and when they access perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas. Unauthorised activity and failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and investigated, as appropriate. Authorised access throughout the business operations and data centres is restricted based on zones and the individual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centres are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the data centres. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the data centre building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security operations personnel manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables throughout the data centres connect the CCTV equipment. Cameras record on-site via digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are retained for at least 7 days based on activity.
(b)
Access Control
.
Infrastructure Security Personnel
. Google has, and maintains, a security policy for its personnel, and requires security training as part of the training package for its personnel. Google’s infrastructure security personnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the Processor Services, and responding to security incidents.
Access Control and Privilege Management
. Customer's administrators and users must authenticate themselves via a central authentication system or via a single sign on system in order to use the Processor Services.
Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy
. Google’s internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorised persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google aims to design its systems to: (i) only allow authorised persons to access data they are authorised to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or removed without authorisation during processing, use and after recording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralised access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary system utilising digital certificates are designed to provide Google with secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimise the potential for unauthorised account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g. login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.
3.
Data
(a)
Data Storage, Isolation & Authentication
.
Google stores data in a multi-tenant environment on Google-owned servers. Data, the Processor Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple geographically dispersed data centres. Google logically isolates each customer's data. A central authentication system is used across all Processor Services to increase uniform security of data.
(b)
Decommissioned Disks and Disk Destruction Guidelines
.
Certain disks containing data may experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that lead them to be decommissioned (“
Decommissioned Disk
”). Every Decommissioned Disk is subject to a series of data destruction processes (the “
Data Destruction Guidelines
”) before leaving Google’s premises either for reuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multi-step process and verified complete by at least two independent validators. The erase results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally, the erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory for reuse and redeployment. If, due to hardware failure, the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely stored until it can be destroyed. Each facility is audited regularly to monitor compliance with the Data Destruction Guidelines.
(c)
Pseudonymous Data
.
Online advertising data are commonly associated with online identifiers which on their own are considered ’pseudonymous’ (i.e. they cannot be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional information). Google has a robust set of policies and technical and organisational controls in place to ensure the separation between pseudonymous data and personally identifiable user information (i.e. information that could be used on its own to directly identify, contact, or precisely locate an individual), such as a user’s Google account data. Google policies only allow for information flows between pseudonymous and personally identifiable data in strictly limited circumstances.
(d)
Launch reviews
.
Google conducts launch reviews for new products and features prior to launch. This includes a privacy review conducted by specially trained privacy engineers. In privacy reviews, privacy engineers ensure that all applicable Google policies and guidelines are followed, including but not limited to policies relating to pseudonymisation and data retention and deletion.
4.
Personnel Security
Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate background checks to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and statutory regulations.
Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel are provided with security training. Personnel handling Customer Personal Data are required to complete additional requirements appropriate to their role. Google’s personnel will not process Customer Personal Data without authorisation.
5.
Subprocessor Security
Before onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the security and privacy practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. Once Google has assessed the risks presented by the Subprocessor, the Subprocessor is required to enter into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms, subject to the requirements set out in Section 11.3 (Requirements for Subprocessor Engagement).

                      fee, and the basis of its calculation, in advance of any such audit. Customer will be responsible for any
                      fees charged by any third party auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such audit.
(d)
Google may object to any third party auditor appointed by Customer to conduct any audit
                      under paragraph 6.1(a) or 6.1(b) of this Appendix 3A if the auditor is, in Google’s reasonable opinion, not
                      suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of Google or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such
                      objection by Google will require Customer to appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself.
(e)
Nothing in these Data Processing Terms will require Google either to disclose to Customer
                      or its third party auditor, or to allow Customer or its third party auditor to access: (i) any data of any
                      other customer of a Google Entity; (ii) any Google Entity’s internal accounting or financial information;
                      (iii) any trade secret of a Google Entity; (iv) any information that, in Google's reasonable opinion, could:
                      (A) compromise the security of any Google Entity’s systems or premises; or (B) cause any Google Entity to
                      breach its obligations under the European Data Protection Legislation or its security and/or privacy
                      obligations to Customer or any third party; or (v) any information that Customer or its third party auditor
                      seeks to access for any reason other than the good faith fulfilment of Customer’s obligations under the
                      European Data Protection Legislation.
7.
Data Transfers
7.1
Restricted European Transfers
. The parties acknowledge that European Data
                    Protection Legislation does not require SCCs or an Alternative Transfer Solution in order to process
                    Customer Personal Data in or transfer it to an Adequate Country. If Customer Personal Data is transferred to
                    any other country, and European Data Protection Legislation applies to the transfers (“
Restricted
                      European Transfers
”), then:
(a)
if Google has adopted an Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted European
                      Transfers, then Google will inform Customer of the relevant solution and ensure that such Restricted
                      European Transfers are made in accordance with that solution; and/or
(b)
if Google has not adopted, or informs Customer that Google is no longer adopting an
                      Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted European Transfers, then:
(i)
if Google’s address is in an Adequate Country:
(A)
the SCCs (Processor-to-Processor, Google Exporter) will apply with respect to such
                          Restricted European Transfers from Google to Subprocessors; and
(B)
in addition, if Customer’s address is not in an Adequate Country, the SCCs
                          (Processor-to-Controller) will apply with respect to Restricted European Transfers between Google
                          and Customer (regardless of whether Customer is a controller and/or a processor); or
(ii)
if Google’s address is not in an Adequate Country, the SCCs (Controller-to-Processor)
                        and/or SCCs (Processor-to-Processor) will apply (according to whether Customer is a controller and/or
                        processor) with respect to such Restricted European Transfers between Customer and Google.
7.2
Supplementary Measures and Information
. Google will provide Customer with
                    information relevant to Restricted European Transfers, including information about supplementary measures to
                    protect Customer Personal Data, as described in Section 7.5 (Verifying Compliance), Appendix 2 (Security
                    Measures) and other materials concerning the nature of the Processor Services and the processing of Customer
                    Personal Data (for example, help centre articles).
7.3
Termination
. If Customer concludes, based on its current or intended use of
                    the Processor Services, that the Alternative Transfer Solution and/or SCCs, as applicable, do not provide
                    appropriate safeguards for Customer Personal Data, then Customer may immediately terminate the Agreement for
                    convenience by notifying Google in writing.
7.4
Alternative Transfer Solution Adoption and Certification
. Information about
                    Google and/or its Affiliates’ adoption of, or certification under, any Alternative Transfer Solutions can be
                    found at
https://business.safety.google/adsdatatransfers
.
8.
Subprocessors
. When engaging any Subprocessor, Google will ensure via a written contract that if
                  the processing of Customer Personal Data is subject to European Data Protection Legislation, the data protection
                  obligations in these Data Processing Terms (as referred to in Article 28(3) of the GDPR, if applicable) are
                  imposed on the Subprocessor.
9.
Google’s Processing Records.
Customer acknowledges that Google is required under the GDPR to:
(a)
collect and maintain records of certain information, including: (i) the name and contact
                    details of each processor and/or controller on behalf of which Google is acting and (if applicable) of such
                    processor’s or controller's local representative and data protection officer, and (ii) if applicable under
                    the Customer SCCs, Customer’s Supervisory Authority; and
(b)
make such information available to any Supervisory Authority. Accordingly, Customer will,
                    where requested and as applicable to Customer, provide such information to Google via the user interface of
                    the Processor Services or via such other means as may be provided by Google, and will use such user
                    interface or other means to ensure that all information provided is kept accurate and up-to-date.
10.
SCCs
10.1
Order of Precedence
. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the
                    Customer SCCs and this Appendix 3A, the remainder of these Data Processing Terms or the remainder of the
                    Agreement, then the Customer SCCs will prevail.
10.2
No Modification of SCCs
. Nothing in the Agreement (including these Data
                    Processing Terms) is intended to modify or contradict any SCCs or prejudice the fundamental rights or
                    freedoms of data subjects under the European Data Protection Legislation.
11.
Changes to SCCs
. Google may only change the SCCs in accordance with Sections 15.2(b) - 15.2(d)
                  (Changes to Data Processing Terms) or to incorporate any new version of the SCCs that may be adopted under the
                  European Data Protection Legislation, in each case in a manner that does not affect the validity of the SCCs
                  under the European Data Protection Legislation.

3.1.1
Roles and Regulatory Compliance; Authorization.
(a)
Processor and Controller Responsibilities.
The parties acknowledge
                        and agree that:

Additional Product
”), the RDP Services may allow that Additional Product to access Customer Personal Data as required for the interoperation of the Additional Product with the RDP Services. For clarity, this Appendix 3B does not apply to the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of any Additional Product used by Customer, including personal data transmitted to or from that Additional Product.
3.2
Data Security
3.2.1
Customer’s Security Responsibilities and Assessment.
(a)
Customer’s Security Responsibilities.
In addition to Customer’s security
                        responsibilities under Section 7.3.1 of these Data Processing Terms, Customer agrees that, without prejudice
                        to Google’s obligations under Sections 7.1 (Google’s Security Measures and Assistance) and 7.2 (Data
                        Incidents) of these Data Processing Terms, Customer is responsible for its use of the RDP Services,
                        including: (1) making appropriate use of the RDP Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the
                        risk in respect of Customer Personal Data; and (2) securing the account authentication credentials, systems
                        and devices Customer uses to access the RDP Services.
(b)
Customer’s Audit Rights.
(i)
Customer may conduct an audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under
                          this Appendix 3B by requesting and reviewing (1) a certificate issued for security verification
                          reflecting the outcome of an audit conducted by a third party auditor (e.g., SOC 2 Type II or ISO/IEC
                          27001 certification or a comparable certification or other security certification of an audit conducted
                          by a third-party auditor agreed by Customer and Google) within 12 months as of the date of Customer’s
                          request and (2) any other information Google determines is reasonably necessary for Customer to verify
                          such compliance.
(ii)
Alternatively, Google may, at its sole discretion and in response to a request by
                          Customer, initiate a third-party audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations under this
                          Appendix 3B. During such an audit, Google will make available to the third-party auditor all information
                          necessary to demonstrate such compliance. Where Customer requests such an audit, Google may charge a fee
                          (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any audit. Google will provide Customer with further details of
                          any applicable fee, and the basis of its calculation, in advance of any such audit. Customer will be
                          responsible for any fees charged by any third-party auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such
                          audit.
(iii)
Nothing in this Appendix 3B will require Google either to disclose to Customer or its
                          third-party auditor, or to allow Customer or its third-party auditor to access:
(1)
any data of any other customer of a Google Entity;
(2)
any Google Entity’s internal accounting or financial information;
(3)
any trade secret of a Google Entity;
(4)
any information that, in Google's reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise the
                            security of any Google Entity’s systems or premises; or (B) cause any Google Entity to breach its
                            obligations under the US State Privacy Laws or its security and/or privacy obligations to Customer
                            or any third party; or
(5)
any information that Customer or its third party auditor seeks to access for any
                            reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer’s obligations under the US State Privacy
                            Laws.
3.3
Data Subject Rights.
For the purposes of this Appendix 3B, Google will adhere to
                    the procedures set forth under Section 9 (Data Subject Requests) to the extent such requests, requests for
                    assistance, or rectification is applicable to the RDP Services.
3.4
Subcontractors.
(a)
Customer generally authorizes Google to engage other entities as subcontractors in
                      connection with the provision of the RDP Services. When engaging any subcontractor, Google will:
(i)
ensure via a written contract that: (A) the subcontractor only accesses and uses
                        Customer Personal Data to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it, and does
                        so in accordance with the Agreement (including this Appendix 3B); and (B) if the processing of Customer
                        Personal Data is subject to the US State Privacy Laws, ensure that the data protection obligations in
                        this Appendix 3B are imposed on the subcontractor;
(ii)
when engaging any new subcontractors, provide notice of such new subcontractors where
                        required by US State Privacy Laws, and, where required by US State Privacy Laws, further provide an
                        opportunity for Customer to object to such subcontractors; and
(iii)
remain fully liable for all obligations subcontracted to, and all acts and omissions of,
                        the subcontractor.
(b)
Customer may object to any new subcontractor by terminating the Agreement for convenience
                      immediately upon written notice to Google, on condition that Customer provides such notice within 90 days of
                      being informed of the engagement of the new subcontractor as described in paragraph 3.4(a)(ii) herein.
4.

, and the parties will

Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Customer.
To the extent
                    that:
(a)
Google transfers European Controller Personal Data to Customer; and
(b)
the transfer is a Restricted European Transfer, Customer as data importer will be deemed
                      to have entered into the Controller SCCs with Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End
                      Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs.

Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Customer
. To the extent that:
(a)
Google transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Customer; and
(b)
the transfer is a Restricted European Transfer,

                    acknowledge that to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to Google, the
                    Controller SCCs are not required because the address of Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End
                    Controller) is in an Adequate Country and such transfers are Permitted European Transfers. This does not
                    affect Google’s obligations under paragraph 4.1 (Restricted European Transfers) of this Appendix 1A.
5.4
Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google.
To the extent that

                    the transfers will be subject to the Controller SCCs, because Google LLC’s address is not in an Adequate
                    Country.

                      Controller SCCs at

or through
                      such other means as may be provided by Google from time to time.
(b)
Customer acknowledges that Google is required under the Controller SCCs to record
                      certain information, including (i) the identity and contact details of the data importer (including any
                      contact person with responsibility for data protection); and (ii) the technical and organisational
                      measures implemented by the data importer. Accordingly, Customer will, where requested and as applicable
                      to Customer, provide such information to Google via such means as may be provided by Google, and will
                      ensure that all information provided is kept accurate and up-to-date.
5.6
Responding to Data Subject Enquiries
. The applicable data importer will be
                    responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the supervisory authority concerning the

(b)
Customer terminates the Agreement in accordance with Clause 16(c) of the Controller
                      SCCs, then for the purposes of Clause 16(d) of the Controller SCCs, Customer directs Google to delete
                      Controller Personal Data, and, unless European Laws require storage, Google will facilitate such
                      deletion as soon as is reasonably practicable, to the extent such deletion is reasonably possible
                      (taking into account that Google is an independent Controller of such data, as well as the nature and
                      functionality of the Controller Services).
6.
Liability if Controller SCCs Apply.
If Controller SCCs apply under paragraph 5 (Controller SCCs) of this Appendix 1A, then the total combined
                  liability of:
(a)
Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited towards Customer; and
(b)
Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited,
                    under or in connection with the Agreement and the Controller SCCs combined will be subject to Section 5
                    (Liability). Clause 12 of the Controller SCCs will not affect the previous sentence.
7.
Third-Party Beneficiaries
Where Google LLC and/or Google Ireland Limited are not a party to the Agreement but are a party to the
                  applicable Controller SCCs in accordance with paragraph 5 (Controller SCCs) of this Appendix 1A, Google LLC

                  and paragraphs 3 (Google End Controllers), 5 (Controller SCCs) and 6 (Liability if Controller SCCs Apply) of
                  this Appendix 1A. To the extent this paragraph 7 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) conflicts or is inconsistent with
                  any other clause in the Agreement, this paragraph 7 (Third-Party Beneficiaries) will apply.
8.

8.1
If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Controller SCCs, this Appendix 1A, the
                    remainder of these Controller Terms and/or the remainder of the Agreement, then the Controller SCCs will
                    prevail.
8.2
Additional Commercial Clauses
. Subject to the amendments in these
                    Controller Terms, the Agreement remains in full force and effect. Paragraphs 5.5 (Contacting Google) to 5.7

Google’s Security Measures.
Google will implement and maintain
                        technical and organizational measures to protect Customer Personal Data against accidental or
                        unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access (“
Security
                          Measures
”). The Security Measures include measures: (i) to encrypt personal data; (ii)
                        to help ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Google’s
                        systems and services; (iii) to help restore timely access to personal data following an incident;
                        and (iv) for regular testing of effectiveness. Google may update or modify the Security Measures
                        from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of
                        the overall security of the Customer Personal Data.
(b)
Access and Compliance.
Google will ensure that all persons
                        authorized to process Customer Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are
                        under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
(c)
Google’s Security Assistance.
Google will (taking into account the
                        nature of the processing of Customer Personal Data and the information available to Google) assist
                        Customer in meeting Customer’s (or, where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s)
                        obligations in respect of security of personal data and personal data breaches, including Customer’s
                        (or, where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s) obligations relating to security of
                        personal data and personal data breaches under the US State Privacy Laws, by:
(i)
implementing and maintaining the Security Measures in accordance with paragraph
                          3.3.1(a) (Google’s Security Measures);

Incident Notification.
If Google becomes aware of a Data Incident
                        (as defined below), Google will: (i) notify Customer of the Data Incident without undue delay; and
                        (ii) promptly take reasonable steps to minimize harm and secure Customer Personal Data. In this
                        Appendix 1B, “
Data Incident
” means a breach of Google’s security leading to the
                        accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to,
                        Customer Personal Data on systems managed by or otherwise controlled by Google. “Data Incidents”
                        will not include unsuccessful attempts or activities that do not compromise the security of Customer
                        Personal Data, including unsuccessful log-in attempts, pings, port scans, denial of service attacks,
                        and other network attacks on firewalls or networked systems.
(b)
Delivery of Notification.
Google will deliver its notification of
                        any Data Incident to the email address designated by Customer, via the user interface of the RDP
                        Services or such other means provided by Google, to receive certain notifications from Google
                        relating to this Appendix 1B (“
Notification Email Address
”) or, at Google’s
                        discretion (including if Customer has not provided a Notification Email Address), by other direct
                        communication (for example, phone call, email, or an in-person meeting). Customer is solely
                        responsible for providing the Notification Email Address and ensuring that the Notification Email
                        Address is current and valid.
(c)
Third Party Notifications.
Customer is solely responsible for complying with incident notification laws
                        applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Data
                        Incident.
(d)
No Acknowledgement of Fault by Google.
Google’s notification of or response to a Data Incident under this paragraph 3.3.2
                        (Data Incidents) will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Google of any fault or liability
                        with respect to the Data Incident.
3.3.3
Customer’s Security Responsibilities and Assessment.
(a)
Customer’s Security Responsibilities.
Customer agrees that, without
                        prejudice to Google’s obligations under paragraphs 3.3.1 (Google’s Security Measures and Assistance)
                        and 3.3.2 (Data Incidents):
(i)
Customer is responsible for its use of the RDP Services, including: (1) making
                          appropriate use of the RDP Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in
                          respect of Customer Personal Data; and (2) securing the account authentication credentials,
                          systems and devices Customer uses to access the RDP Services; and
(ii)
Google has no obligation to protect Customer Personal Data that Customer elects
                          to store or transfer outside of Google’s and its subcontractors’ systems.
(b)
Customer’s Security Assessment.
Customer acknowledges and agrees
                        that the Security Measures implemented and maintained by Google as set out in paragraph 3.3.1(a)
                        (Google’s Security Measures) provide a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of
                        Customer Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and
                        the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of Customer Personal Data as well as the
                        risks to individuals.
(c)
Customer’s Audit Rights.
(i)
Customer may conduct an audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations
                          under this Appendix 1B by requesting and reviewing (1) a certificate issued for security
                          verification reflecting the outcome of an audit conducted by a third party auditor (e.g., SOC 2
                          Type II or ISO/IEC 27001 certification or a comparable certification or other security
                          certification of an audit conducted by a third-party auditor agreed by Customer and Google)
                          within 12 months as of the date of Customer’s request and (2) any other information Google
                          determines is reasonably necessary for Customer to verify such compliance.
(ii)
Alternatively, Google may, at its sole discretion and in response to a request
                          by Customer, initiate a third-party audit to verify Google’s compliance with its obligations
                          under this Appendix 1B. During such an audit, Google will make available to the third-party
                          auditor all information necessary to demonstrate such compliance. Where Customer requests such
                          an audit, Google may charge a fee (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any audit. Google
                          will provide Customer with further details of any applicable fee, and the basis of its
                          calculation, in advance of any such audit. Customer will be responsible for any fees charged by
                          any third-party auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such audit.
(iii)
Nothing in this Appendix 1B will require Google either to disclose to Customer
                          or its third-party auditor, or to allow Customer or its third-party auditor to access:
(1)
any data of any other customer of a Google Entity;
(2)
any Google Entity’s internal accounting or financial information;
(3)
any trade secret of a Google Entity;
(4)
any information that, in Google's reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise
                            the security of any Google Entity’s systems or premises; or (B) cause any Google Entity to
                            breach its obligations under the US State Privacy Laws or its security and/or privacy
                            obligations to Customer or any third party; or
(5)
any information that Customer or its third party auditor seeks to access for
                            any reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer’s obligations under the US
                            State Privacy Laws.
3.4
Assistance with Impact Assessments.
Google will (taking into account the
                    nature of the processing and the information available to Google) assist Customer in meeting Customer’s (or,
                    where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s) obligations relating to data protection impact
                    assessments and prior regulatory consultations to the extent required under the US State Privacy Laws by:
(a)
providing the Security Documentation;
(b)
providing the information contained in the Agreement (including this Appendix 1B); and

(a)
respond directly to the data subject’s request in accordance with the standard
                        functionality of a tool (if any) made available by a Google Entity to data subjects that enables
                        Google to respond directly and in a standardized manner to certain requests from data subjects in
                        relation to Customer Personal Data (for example, online advertising settings or an opt-out browser
                        plugin) (“
Data Subject Tool
”) (if the request is made via a Data Subject Tool); or
(b)
advise the data subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be
                        responsible for responding to such request (if the request is not made via a Data Subject Tool).

                      connection with the provision of the RDP Services. When engaging any subcontractor, Google will:
(i)
ensure via a written contract that: (1) the subcontractor only accesses and uses
                        Customer Personal Data to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it, and
                        does so in accordance with the Agreement (including this Appendix 1B); and (2) if the processing of
                        Customer Personal Data is subject to the US State Privacy Laws, ensure that the data protection

(ii)
when engaging any new subcontractors, provide notice of such new subcontractors
                        where required by US State Privacy Laws, and, where required by US State Privacy Laws, further
                        provide an opportunity for Customer to object to such subcontractors; and
(iii)
remain fully liable for all obligations subcontracted to, and all acts and
                        omissions of, the subcontractor.
(b)
Customer may object to any new subcontractor by terminating the Agreement for
                      convenience immediately upon written notice to Google, on condition that Customer provides such notice
                      within 90 days of being informed of the engagement of the new subcontractor as described in paragraph
