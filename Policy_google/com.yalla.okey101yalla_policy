Handing over your account to others for operation, conducting private transactions with others, prohibited proxy recharge ( any purchase of Virtual Currencies through unofficial channels, or entrusting accounts to others to recharge on their behalf are strictly forbidden. The common types of prohibited proxy recharges (including but not limited to, purchase and recharge from nonofficial third-party recharge platforms, private transactions with third parties, and provision of user accounts to log in and recharge from third-party devices) or malicious refunds after recharging are all violations of the platform rules.

Moreover, these types of recharge and/or refunds are mostly scams, which can easily cause property damage. 101 Okey Yalla will always crack down on the aforementioned behaviors and maintain the right to pursue legal liabilities according to applicable law.
In response to the aforesaid violations, the platform has rights to take measures including but not limited to the following:
Take back all the virtual currency and purchased items in the account suspected of proxy charging or malicious refund.
Freeze all remaining virtual items in the account suspected of the malicious refund until the refund is canceled or the amount of refund is reimbursed in full.
Time-limited or permanent ban on the account.
We are not liable for any losses or damages caused by recharging on unofficial proxy recharge, malicious refunds, or account transactions.
You may cancel your account at any time, and 101 Okey Yalla may terminate your account in accordance with the Terms.
