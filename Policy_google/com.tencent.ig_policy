your connected social media account (WeChat, Facebook, QQ, VKontakte, Twitter,
Google Play, Game
Center
or LINE) in order to set up
your profile, including your name as it appears on your social media profile,
your user ID and your profile picture). For certain regions, you may also be
asked to provide us with your date of birth (stored device-side only) to verify
your age and for administration of the gameplay management system. If you are
located in certain regions, we may ask you to provide an email address for the
purpose of verifying parental or guardian consent to use the Game services if
you are under the relevant minimum age. You also provide us with information

information you voluntarily elect to provide in order to customise gameplay or
Game Services, such as gender or photos you upload to your in-Game photo wall)
or your nickname when you log-in as a ‘guest’ in order to use the Game.
Once a Game account is set up, you may
also choose to provide us with your mobile phone number or email address and a
password, which you may select yourself for these purposes. These will be bound
to your account (once verified by way of a verification code we will send to
you) for the purposes of enabling login by email or mobile phone number. If you
choose to bind your phone number or email address with your account, you will
have the option to login via your mobile phone number or email address and we will
access your phone number or email address to verify you as a user without you
having to enter a validation code or password every time you login. If you
choose to bind your phone number, you can also enable two-factor
authentication. Once enabled, we will verify additional data for authentication
if you log in from a new device. If you choose to bind your email address, we
will send an account security alert to your email address if we detect any
suspicious activity. If you need to recover your account, we will ask

PRIVACY FAQ
IN-GAME CHAT SAFETY
FUNCTION
1.
Introduction
We take
your data privacy and security very seriously. We take steps to ensure that
your content is stored and processed by us in a transparent way and using
secure and reliable technology.
We
understand that your trust is something we earn. As part of that process, we
work to keep you informed of our data privacy policy and measures, as they may
change over time.
This
FAQ explains some common questions on a feature for certain regions concerning
chat of
PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE
(“
Game
”), particularly for those users
and prospective users who have questions about how we meet our requirements
under data protection laws and other applicable regulations concerning data
privacy.
For
further information regarding our data privacy practices and this FAQ:
(a)
Please review the PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE
Privacy Policy
– which sets out how we collect, store and process your personal data to
provide you with the Game, and the
End User
License Agreement
for
PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE.
(b)
Please contact our privacy team via email at
dpo@proximabeta.com
should
you have any further questions.
2.
What is the in-game chat safety function?
To
ensure the Game provides a safe platform for users of the Game, we have
introduced an in-Game chat safety function (“
Safety Feature
”) in certain regions. The Safety Feature helps us to
improve your experience of the Game by flagging users who use chat function in
violation of our
End User
License Agreement
. For
countries where the law requires
that
we have a legal basis for
processing certain data, we operate the Safety Feature in our legitimate
interests to ensure the safety and integrity of our Game. The Safety Feature
works to identify, for example, unsolicited commercial communications, including
plug-in sales and advertising, spam, harmful communication, exploits, bullying,
harassment, threats of violence or conduct which is hateful, harassing,
abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, humiliating,
threatening, profane or similarly objectionable (“
Prohibited Conduct
”).
3.
What are the consequences for users who engage in
Prohibited Conduct?
All
users are required to comply with our
End User
License Agreement
, and
you should familiarize yourself with your obligations as part of our gaming
community. In order to ensure a safe gaming environment for our users we may
take action against users who violate the
End User
License Agreement
or otherwise engage in
Prohibited Conduct, which may include limiting use of those features that have
been abused.
4.
How can I use the Safety Feature and how does it work?
When
you observe a user engaging in Prohibited Conduct, you can press the “Report”
button on the screen if this feature is available in your region. This will
record a short snippet of the chat, and for voice chat, convert it into text at
the same time or store the last 30 seconds of the voice chat on our servers.
The chat data may be automatically translated if needed. The chat data will be
reviewed for Prohibited Conduct and, in certain regions, for improvement of the
tools we use to identify violations.
5.
What if I think I have been implicated by mistake?
We have
implemented safeguards to ensure any consequences are appropriate and
proportionate to the relevant Prohibited Conduct and the frequency with which
such Prohibited Conduct has occurred.
We will
notify you if you have been muted or restricted from sending chats as a result
of your breach of the
End User
License Agreement
. If
you think your use of the chat functions was restricted by mistake, please
contact us at
service@pubgmobile.com
to request a review.
6.
Do you warn users before taking action?
We may
not issue a warning before restricting your use of the chat functions but we
will notify you if restrictions are made.
7.
Do you store chats and where do you store them?
The
Safety Feature is designed to protect your privacy. Documented chat and the
clip (for voice chat) is not stored, except where the information provides
evidence of Prohibited Conduct by a user. In these cases we store the
documented chat as evidence
, and in certain regions we
also store the documented chat and voice file in anonymized form for
improvement of the tools we use to identify violations,
on our servers in
Singapore and subsequently automatically delete it in accordance with our
Privacy Policy
.
8.
Do you disclose chats to any third parties?
We do
not disclose any chats of any user to any third party, except where necessary
for the review and translation process and to assist us in improving our
anti-cheating tools, or in exceptional circumstances, such as where we believe
we are legally required to (for example, if we are subject to a court order for
disclosure), or where we need to do so in order to enforce or protect your
rights, our rights or the rights of other users. Please consult our
Privacy Policy
for further details.
9.
Can I object to your processing of my chats?
Yes. If
you are a resident of a relevant country as noted in our
Privacy Policy
,
you may have the right to object to, and seek restriction of, our processing of
your chats for this purpose. To exercise your right, please contact us at
dpo@proximabeta.com
and please consult the
Privacy Policy
for further information.
We will
consider several factors when assessing an objection, including: our users'
reasonable expectations; the benefits and risks to you, us, or other users as a
result of our implementation of the Safety Feature; and other available means
to achieve the same purpose the Safety Feature achieves that may be less
invasive and do not require disproportional effort. Unless the processing is
based on our compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons, your
objection will be upheld and we will cease processing your information.
10.
Is the Safety Feature secure and how do you comply
with data protection laws?
We have
a comprehensive global privacy program directed at protecting your personal
data. You can read about how we process and protect personal data in our
Privacy Policy
.
We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures for the purpose
of preventing loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure of your
information.
11.
How do you respond to law enforcement requests for
chat information?
We may,
from time to time, receive law enforcement requests to disclose your chat
information (and its translation) to regulators, courts or law enforcement
bodies. When we receive these requests, we take reasonable steps to query them
and establish whether or not we are legally required to respond to them. When
we are legally required to respond to such a request, we will take measures to
safeguard your legal rights and your personal data.

PRIVACY FAQ
IN-GAME CHAT SAFETY
FUNCTION
1.
Introduction
We take
your data privacy and security very seriously. We take steps to ensure that
your content is stored and processed by us in a transparent way and using
secure and reliable technology.
We
understand that your trust is something we earn. As part of that process, we
work to keep you informed of our data privacy policy and measures, as they may
change over time.
This
FAQ explains some common questions on a feature for certain regions concerning
chat of
PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE
(“
Game
”), particularly for those users
and prospective users who have questions about how we meet our requirements
under data protection laws and other applicable regulations concerning data
privacy.
For
further information regarding our data privacy practices and this FAQ:
(a)
Please review the PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE
Privacy Policy
– which sets out how we collect, store and process your personal data to
provide you with the Game, and the
End User
License Agreement
for
PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE.
(b)
Please contact our privacy team via email at
dpo@proximabeta.com
should
you have any further questions.
2.
What is the in-game chat safety function?
To
ensure the Game provides a safe platform for users of the Game, we have
introduced an in-Game chat safety function (“
Safety Feature
”) in certain regions. The Safety Feature helps us to
improve your experience of the Game by flagging users who use chat function in
violation of our
End User
License Agreement
. For
countries where the law requires
that
we have a legal basis for
processing certain data, we operate the Safety Feature in our legitimate
interests to ensure the safety and integrity of our Game. The Safety Feature
works to identify, for example, unsolicited commercial communications, including
plug-in sales and advertising, spam, harmful communication, exploits, bullying,
harassment, threats of violence or conduct which is hateful, harassing,
abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, humiliating,
threatening, profane or similarly objectionable (“
Prohibited Conduct
”).
3.
What are the consequences for users who engage in
Prohibited Conduct?
All
users are required to comply with our
End User
License Agreement
, and
you should familiarize yourself with your obligations as part of our gaming
community. In order to ensure a safe gaming environment for our users we may
take action against users who violate the
End User
License Agreement
or otherwise engage in
Prohibited Conduct, which may include limiting use of those features that have
been abused.
4.
How can I use the Safety Feature and how does it work?
When
you observe a user engaging in Prohibited Conduct, you can press the “Report”
button on the screen if this feature is available in your region. This will
record a short snippet of the chat, and for voice chat, convert it into text at
the same time or store the last 30 seconds of the voice chat on our servers.
The chat data may be automatically translated if needed. The chat data will be
reviewed for Prohibited Conduct and, in certain regions, for improvement of the
tools we use to identify violations.
5.
What if I think I have been implicated by mistake?
We have
implemented safeguards to ensure any consequences are appropriate and
proportionate to the relevant Prohibited Conduct and the frequency with which
such Prohibited Conduct has occurred.
We will
notify you if you have been muted or restricted from sending chats as a result
of your breach of the
End User
License Agreement
. If
you think your use of the chat functions was restricted by mistake, please
contact us at
service@pubgmobile.com
to request a review.
6.
Do you warn users before taking action?
We may
not issue a warning before restricting your use of the chat functions but we
will notify you if restrictions are made.
7.
Do you store chats and where do you store them?
The
Safety Feature is designed to protect your privacy. Documented chat and the
clip (for voice chat) is not stored, except where the information provides
evidence of Prohibited Conduct by a user. In these cases we store the
documented chat as evidence
, and in certain regions we
also store the documented chat and voice file in anonymized form for
improvement of the tools we use to identify violations,
on our servers in
Singapore and subsequently automatically delete it in accordance with our
Privacy Policy
.
8.
Do you disclose chats to any third parties?
We do
not disclose any chats of any user to any third party, except where necessary
for the review and translation process and to assist us in improving our
anti-cheating tools, or in exceptional circumstances, such as where we believe
we are legally required to (for example, if we are subject to a court order for
disclosure), or where we need to do so in order to enforce or protect your
rights, our rights or the rights of other users. Please consult our
Privacy Policy
for further details.
9.
Can I object to your processing of my chats?
Yes. If
you are a resident of a relevant country as noted in our
Privacy Policy
,
you may have the right to object to, and seek restriction of, our processing of
your chats for this purpose. To exercise your right, please contact us at
dpo@proximabeta.com
and please consult the
Privacy Policy
for further information.
We will
consider several factors when assessing an objection, including: our users'
reasonable expectations; the benefits and risks to you, us, or other users as a
result of our implementation of the Safety Feature; and other available means
to achieve the same purpose the Safety Feature achieves that may be less
invasive and do not require disproportional effort. Unless the processing is
based on our compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons, your
objection will be upheld and we will cease processing your information.
10.
Is the Safety Feature secure and how do you comply
with data protection laws?
We have
a comprehensive global privacy program directed at protecting your personal
data. You can read about how we process and protect personal data in our
Privacy Policy
.
We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures for the purpose
of preventing loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure of your
information.
11.
How do you respond to law enforcement requests for
chat information?
We may,
from time to time, receive law enforcement requests to disclose your chat
information (and its translation) to regulators, courts or law enforcement
bodies. When we receive these requests, we take reasonable steps to query them
and establish whether or not we are legally required to respond to them. When
we are legally required to respond to such a request, we will take measures to
safeguard your legal rights and your personal data.
