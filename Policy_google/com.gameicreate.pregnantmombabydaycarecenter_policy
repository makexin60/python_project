You are solely responsible, throughout the duration of this Agreement and you or Your Child’s access to and use of the Software and/or access to or use of the Associated Services, for obtaining, providing, establishing and maintaining, at your sole cost, all services, software, hardware, and other prerequisites that are or may be necessary for downloading, installing, accessing, and/or use of the Software and/or access to or use of the Associated Services, including, without limitation, any wireless services and wireless data services (collectively, "Prerequisites"), and Gamesticky is not, and shall not be, liable for any Prerequisite, or the provision thereof, or any costs, charges, fees, taxes, rates, or other payments incurred or made in connection therewith. You agree to comply with all terms and agreement of any provider of any Prerequisites used by you or Your Child (e.g., a wireless data service agreement).
Gamesticky has and shall have no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services of any kind with respect to the Software and/or the Associated Services. If Gamesticky, in its sole discretion, directly or indirectly makes available any maintenance or support, Gamesticky is not obligated at any time to continue or provide again any maintenance or support and Gamesticky may at any time discontinue, reduce and limit access to, or charge any fee for any maintenance or support if and as it decides in its sole discretion, with or without notice to you or Your Child. Gamesticky does not offer, and does not agree to, any service level agreement, service levels, credit, uptime, minimum uptime, or other similar features to you or Your Child.
TERM.
This Agreement is effective upon Your Acceptance and continues, including, without limitation, the License, until the end of the expiration of the License Term (as defined below in this Section IV) or the termination or cancellation of this Agreement, whichever occurs earlier (the "Term"). The "License Term" means the applicable one of the periods of time identified in the following paragraphs a – c of this Section IV, depending on how you received the Access Right:
Activation Code License: If the License is an Activation Code License, the "License Term" means the period of time that begins with the Activation (as defined below in this Section IV.a) and continues for such period of time that corresponds to the duration for which you purchased the Access Right. For example, if you purchased the Access Right for thirty days, the License Term is thirty days from such Activation, and to access and use the Software and/or the Associated Services after the end of such thirty days, you have to purchase another Access Right. Solely in the event that this Section IV.a applies, the term "Activation" means the earliest date and time when you received the Activation Code from Gamesticky or an Authorized Reseller, regardless of the time of Your Acceptance or activation of the License. Thus, in the event that you purchased the Access Right and the Activation Code in an Authorized Reseller’s store, the Activation will have occurred at the time that you received the Activation Code in such store regardless of when Your Acceptance occurs or whether or not, or when, you actually insert the Activation Code or take any steps to activating the License. An Activation Code License or receipt of the Access Right for an Activation Code License does not entitle You or Your Child automatically (without additional purchase) to any additional Activation Code License or an extension thereof. Upon the end of the License Term, if you or Your Child wish to further access or use the Software and/or the Associated Services, you must purchase a new Activation Code License or a Paid Open Market License. Otherwise, this Agreement, the Access Right, and the license and all rights of you or Your Child, including, without limitation, the right to access and use the Services and receive Associated Services, terminates and ends. The Activation Code License does not convert into or continue as a No-Charge Open Market License or any other License.
Paid Open Market License: If the License is a Paid Open Market License, the "License Term" means the period of time that begins with the Activation (as defined below in this Section IV.b) and continues for such period of time that corresponds to the duration for which you purchased the Access Right. For example, if you purchased the Access Right for thirty days, the License Term is thirty days from such Activation, and to access and use the Software and/or the Associated Services after the end of such thirty days, you have to purchase another Access Right. Solely in the event that this Section IV.b applies, the term "Activation" means the date and time of Your Acceptance or of your payment of all or part of the License Fee for the Access Right, whichever occurs earlier. Thus, in the event that you purchased the Access Right online from Gamesticky or an Authorized Reseller, the Activation will have occurred at the time that you paid all or part of the License Fee or Your Acceptance regardless of whether or not, or when, you actually download, install or activate the License. A Paid Open Market License or receipt of the Access Right for a Paid Open Market License does not entitle You or Your Child automatically (without additional purchase) to any additional Paid Open Market License or an extension thereof. Upon the end of the License Term of the Paid Open Market License, if the Paid Open Market License ends solely as a result of the expiration of the License Term (and not as a result of any other termination, expiration, or cancellation, in which case the License and this Agreement terminates and ends without any conversion), the Paid Open Market License may automatically, without need for any notice or action of any kind, terminate and end and convert to a No-Charge Open Market License. No such conversion is or shall be required. In the event of such conversion, as of such conversion, the License will be a No-Charge Open Market License under this Agreement and be governed by the terms of this Agreement applying to a No-Charge Open Market License in effect at that time subject to any modification of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement.
Trial Period License: If the License is a Trial Period License, the "License Term" means the Trial Period. The Trial Period begins with the Activation (as defined below in this Section IV.c). Solely in the event that this Section IV.c applies, the term "Activation" means the date and time of Your Acceptance. Depending on the Software, upon the end of the License Term of the Trial Period License, if the Trial Period License ends solely as a result of the expiration of the License Term (and not as a result of any other termination, expiration, or cancellation, in which case the License and this Agreement terminates and ends without any conversion), the Trial Period License may automatically, without need for any notice or action of any kind, terminate and end and convert to a No-Charge Open Market License. No such conversion is or shall be required. In the event of any such conversion, as of such conversion, the License will be a No-Charge Open Market License under this Agreement and be governed by the terms of this Agreement applying to a No-Charge Open Market License in effect at that time subject to any modification of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement. A Trial Period License or receipt of the Access Right for a Trial Period License does not entitle You or Your Child to any additional Trial Period License or an extension thereof. To be able and have the right to access and use the Software and/or the Associated Services other than under a No-Charge Market License after the Trial Period, you must purchase a new Access Right from Gamesticky or an Authorized Reseller. Except as otherwise authorized by Gamesticky in advance in writing to you, you and Your Child are limited to receiving one Access Right for a Trial Period for the same type of Software.
No-Charge Open Market License: If the License is a No-Charge Open Market License, the "License Term" begins with Your Acceptance and continues for such period of time that corresponds to the duration for which you received such Access Right, or if there is no such period of time, indefinitely until Gamesticky terminate this Agreement, which Gamesticky may do so at any time with or without cause.
LICENSE FEES.
Unless you received from Gamesticky the Access Right without the obligation to pay any License Fee, i.e., the License under this Agreement is granted for, and the License Term is, a Trial Period, the License is granted to you in consideration for your payment of the fee, price, or charge that you agreed to pay Gamesticky or an Authorized Reseller for the Access Right (such fee, price, or charge, the "License Fee"). You agree to pay any License Fee or part thereof not yet paid, and any other amount due to Gamesticky, and you represent and warrant that any License Fee by you before Your Acceptance has been paid, in immediately available indefeasible unconditional funds without any set-off or deduction. Any amount of any License Fee or amount due to Gamesticky that is unpaid when it is due shall accrue interest from the date it is due until Gamesticky’s receipt of the payment of such amount at the rate of the lower of (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per full or partial calendar month or (ii) the highest enforceable rate of interest under applicable law. All such interest shall be paid simultaneously with the payment of the unpaid amount on which such interest accrued.
Gamesticky is not responsible, and you are solely responsible, for any access, data, transmission, and other fees and any expenses you may incur or may be charged by any third party, including, without limitation, your wireless service provider, may charge in connection with your access or use of the Software and/or the Associated Services, including, without limitation, data traffic costs.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OWNERSHIP, AND RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
The Software and the Access Services are proprietary to Gamesticky. You acknowledge and agree that the Software is being licensed, not sold, to you by Gamesticky. No rights are granted or extended, implicitly, expressly, or otherwise, to any third party, and your access and use of the Software and/or the Associated Services does not, and shall not be deemed, to exhaust any Intellectual Property Right in or to or related to the Software and/ or the Associated Services with regard to you outside the express license in this Agreement or to any third party. All Intellectual Property Rights to the Software, the Access Services, all Modifications, and all content and code are owned by Gamesticky and are protected by law. You further acknowledge and agree that you do, and shall not be deemed to, acquire any ownership, co-ownership, right, title, interest, license (except solely the express license to access and use the Software and the right to access and use the Associated Services expressly granted to you as set forth in this Agreement during the term of this Agreement), or encumbrance in or to, and that Gamesticky shall retain its entire sole ownership, right, title, interest in and to, the Software, the Associated Services, all Modifications, all derivations and derivative works therefrom and all improvements, modifications, upgrades, updates, error corrections, patches, enhancements, versions, and alterations thereto, all content, works, inventions, technology, data, information, and code therein or thereof, and all other proprietary products and services of Gamesticky (including without limitation products and services released solely or jointly with its partners), and all Intellectual Property Rights (as defined herein) in or to or arising out of or relating to any of the foregoing (collectively, "Gamesticky Property").
The term "Intellectual Property Rights" means, individually and collectively, any and all of the following, anywhere in the world and under any law: (a) patents, patent applications, patent disclosures, invention disclosures, and inventions (whether patentable or not), (b) trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names, logos, corporate names and domain names, and all goodwill in or arising from any of the foregoing, (c) copyrights and rights in and to or arising from or related to copyrightable works (including computer programs), mask works and rights in data and databases, (d) rights in and to or arising from or related to trade secrets, know-how, show-how, and other confidential or proprietary information, and (e) all other intellectual and industrial property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights, and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection provided by applicable law, regulations or rules in any jurisdiction throughout the world. You shall promptly notify Gamesticky if you become aware of any possible third-party infringement of Gamesticky's Intellectual Property Rights arising out of or relating to the Software and/or the Associated Services and fully cooperate with Gamesticky in any legal action taken by Gamesticky against third parties to enforce its Intellectual Property Rights. You shall safeguard the Software (including all copies thereof) from infringement, misappropriation, theft, misuse or unauthorized access.
Without Gamesticky's written permission, no entity or individual shall use, duplicate, change, copy, distribute or use or sell with other products any part of the Software and/or the Associated Services, any other product, information or materials owned by Gamesticky, or any other Gamesticky Property in any manner for any reason whatsoever.
Without Gamesticky's written permission, no entity or individual shall carry out, duplicate, modify, distribute, copy or infringe in other ways Gamesticky’s products and technology in any manner for any reason whatsoever.
If and to the extent you acquire or obtain any ownership, co-ownership, right, title, interest, license (except solely the express license to access and use the Software and the right to access and use the Associated Services expressly granted to you as set forth in this Agreement during the term of this Agreement), or encumbrance, you agree to assign, transfer, and convey, and you hereby assign, transfer, and convey, to Gamesticky – free of any royalty, fee, or other payment obligation of Gamesticky or any of its affiliates – all such ownership, co-ownership, right, title, interest, license, and encumbrance. You agree to execute any document and take any other action or forego to take any other action as requested by Gamesticky to you to give effect..
RIGHT OF REPUTATION.
As a legal person, Gamesticky's rights of reputation are protected by the law. Where the company's goodwill is slandered or the rights of reputation are infringed by illegal means of forging and disseminating false information and materials, or similar actions, Gamesticky has the right to pursue legal responsibilities according to law. Where the above Intellectual Property Rights of Gamesticky are infringed or the exercise of the Intellectual Property Rights are hindered, legal responsibilities will be investigated according to law and you may be held liable for such infringement and/or hindering.
TERMINATION.
This Agreement expires, terminates, and ends immediately and automatically, without need for any notice or other act: (i) upon the end of the License Term, or (ii) any fee or price due for the License, or any other payment due under this Agreement, is not paid to or received by Gamesticky, whether or not resulting from any fault by you.
This Agreement also terminates immediately and automatically, without need for any notice or other act, if and when you (i) breach or violate or default under any provision of this Agreement or obligation of you or Your Child, or (ii) you or Your Child engages in any act or omission that constitutes or results in any breach or violation of, or default under, any provision of this Agreement, or (iii) engage, or encourage others to engage, in any misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful, illegal, or dishonest act or omission in connection with the Software and/or the Associated Services or relating to this Agreement or the Software and/or the Associated Services; or (iv) you fail to agree to any change, modification, amendment, or alteration of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement; or (v) you or Your Child fails to permit any installation or inclusion of any Modification provided by Gamesticky to you or Your Child, or to the Software installed on the Device.
Gamesticky may also terminate this Agreement with immediate effect: (i) as set forth in Section XVI.(d) of this Agreement, or (ii) if or to the extent Gamesticky ceases to make the Software, or removes the Software from being, available for licensing, and/or ceases to make the Associated Services available for access or use, by members of the public in anywhere or in your country, region, or area, or (iii) if Gamesticky fails to conduct business operations or takes steps to dissolve or cease to exist; or (iv) if Gamesticky or you files or is or becomes subject to a petition in bankruptcy; or (v) if Gamesticky admits the inability to pay the debts as they become due, makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or becomes subject to the appointment of a receiver; or (vi) upon your death or legal incapacity.
Gamesticky may terminate this Agreement by disconnecting your or Your Child’s access to and use of the Software and/or the Associated Services, without need or requirement for any notice. Gamesticky may give you notice of any termination, expiration, or cancellation if Gamesticky decides to do so in its sole discretion, provided, however, that, giving any notice of termination shall not obligate or require Gamesticky to give such notice in any other instance of a termination.
You may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving Gamesticky written notice of termination addressed to Gamesticky at the address of its headquarters and to the attention of the "Legal Department" at such address.
Any access to or use of the Software and/or the Associated Services following any event of termination of this Agreement (e.g., if Gamesticky and/or you are unaware of such termination) shall not negate such termination or the fact that such termination occurred.
EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

The provisions of Section V (regarding any License Fee and other amount due to Gamesticky and unpaid), VI, VII, and X through XXIV of this Agreement, and this Section IX shall survive any termination, expiration, or cancellation of this Agreement.
Any termination, expiration, or cancellation of this Agreement does not waive, terminate, cancel, or avoid any duty or obligation to pay any License Fee or other fee, price, or other charge due by you to Gamesticky or its Authorized Resellers for the License Term during which such termination occurs, if and to the extent not yet paid, which shall be due immediately upon termination if not yet due, and does not entitle or give you any right or expectation to a refund, reimbursement, repayment, compensation for, or other receipt of the amount of any License Fee or any other fee, price, or other charge paid in connection with the Software and/or the Associated Services or this Agreement. Any and all payments made to Gamesticky in connection with the License or under this Agreement are non-refundable.

You accept full responsibility and agree to be fully liable for all results, consequences, injuries, death, damages, emotional distress, and harm of any kind caused by your or Your Child’s use, application, or implementation of the Software, the Associated Services, or the Device, or any violation of the provisions of this Agreement by you.
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.
Gamesticky MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS HEREUNDER OR REGARDING THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES. Gamesticky DISCLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES. THE SOFTWARE AND THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". Gamesticky EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, WORKMANSHIP, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SECURITY, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES. YOU DOWNLOAD AND USE THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR HARDWARE DEVICE(S) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES.
IN THE EVENT OF ANY BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY, OR ANY FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES TO CONFORM TO ANY WARRANTY, THAT APPLIES AND IS NOT OR CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY DISCLAIMED HEREUNDER UNDER APPLICABLE LAW: (I) YOU MAY NOTIFY Gamesticky DURING THE LICENSE TERM THEREOF AND Gamesticky MAY CORRECT SUCH FAILURE OR BREACH, AND (II) IF YOU PAID TO Gamesticky A LICENSE FEE FOR THE LICENSE DURING SUCH LICENSE TERM AND SUCH CORRECTION DOES NOT OCCUR OR Gamesticky DECIDES TO REPAY SUCH LICENSE FEE, Gamesticky WILL REFUND SUCH LICENSE FEE FOR SUCH LICENSE TERM, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Gamesticky WILL HAVE NO OTHER WARRANTY OBLIGATION OR OTHER LIABILITY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY OTHER CLAIMS, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY FAILURE TO CONFORM TO ANY WARRANTY WILL BE YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. THE FOREGOING REFUND OF THE LICENSE FEE, IF ANY, CONSTITUTES THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY THAT Gamesticky SHALL HAVE UNDER AND RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES. IF NO LICENSE FEE HAS BEEN PAID TO Gamesticky, SUCH AS IF THE LICENSE IS FOR A TRIAL PERIOD, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY PAYMENT BY Gamesticky.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
NEITHER Gamesticky NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS OR AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY USER FOR ANY USE OR MISUSE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES. SUCH EXCLUSION INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO: (A) DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE (EVEN IF Gamesticky HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES); (B) APPLIES WHETHER DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES, FROM INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES, OR FROM THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES INCURRED BY THIRD PARTIES); AND (C) APPLIES NOTWITHSTANDING A FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

INDEMNIFICATION.
You will indemnify and hold harmless Gamesticky and its parents, subsidiaries, officers, directors, shareholders, agents and employees, from any and all losses to the extent resulting from any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand, investigation or assessment due to or arising directly or indirectly out of (i) your or Your Child’s access and/or use of the Software and/or the Associated Services, (ii) any violation of any applicable law arising from you or Your Child's conduct or in connection with your or Your Child's use or misuse of the Software and/or the Associated Services, (iii) any alleged violation of this Agreement or other applicable agreements between you and Gamesticky, (iv) any negligence (whether sole, contributory, or comparative) and willful misconduct of you or Your Child, and (v) any alleged violation of any applicable law or regulation (EXPRESSLY INCLUDING, IN EACH CASE, ANY SUCH LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ORDINARY, SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF Gamesticky). Gamesticky reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, but doing so will not excuse your indemnity obligations.
LEGAL RESTRICTIONS.
Some countries and jurisdictions do not allow the conditions, limitations, disclaimer, or exclusion of implied warranties, representations, or conditions, so some of the disclaimers, exclusions, limitations, and/or obligations in Sections X, XI, XII, and/or XIII of this Agreement may not apply to you. In such case: (i) the conditions, limitations, disclaimer, or exclusion of implied warranties, representations, or conditions shall not be invalidated or nullified but be revised and remain valid and enforceable such that they are effective to the greatest extent as permitted under applicable law, and (ii) if any implied warranties or conditions would then otherwise arise, such implied warranties and conditions will be limited in duration to ninety (90) days, or if applicable law requires a longer time period, the shortest legally required time period, from the date of the delivery of the Software and/or the Associated Services.
BASIS OF BARGAIN.
You agrees and acknowledges that Gamesticky has set its fees and the parties have entered into this Agreement in reliance on the limited warranties, warranty disclaimers, limitations and exclusions of liability, and indemnity set forth herein, that the same reflect an agreed-to allocation of risk between the parties (including the risk that a remedy may fail of its essential purpose and cause consequential loss), and that the same forms an essential basis of the bargain between the parties. You agree and acknowledge that Gamesticky would not have been able to license the Software and/or make available any Associated Service at the amount charged on an economic basis without such limitations.
INFRINGEMENT.
If use of the Software and/or any of the Associated Services may be enjoined due to a claim of infringement by a third party then, at its sole discretion and expense, Gamesticky may do one of the following: (a) negotiate a license or other agreement so that the Software and/ or the any of the Associated Services is no longer subject to such a potential claim, (b) modify the Software and/or any of the Associated Services so that it becomes non-infringing, provided such modification can be accomplished without materially affecting the performance and functionality of the Software and/or the Associated Services, (c) replace the Software and/or the Associated Services with non-infringing software, or (d) terminate this Agreement by written notice of termination to you, in which case you shall stop using the Software and/or the Associated Services. The foregoing sets out the entire liability of Gamesticky and the sole obligations of Gamesticky to you and Your Child in respect of any claim that the Software and/ or any of the Associated Services or its use infringes any third party rights.
PRIVACY POLICY.
As a mobile security, privacy and parental control service provider, Gamesticky may collect certain personal information about you ("Parental Information") and Your Child or children ("Children’s Information") (collectively, Parental Information and Children’s Information are "Personal Information") in connection with the Software and/or the Associated Services. You consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and other handling of such Personal Information as specified in the Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.
You acknowledge that the Software, or any part thereof, may be subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (Title 15 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 730 et seq.), U.S. trade embargo regulations (Title 31 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 500 et seq.), other regulations of the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State, and Treasury (collectively, "Export Control Law''). Accordingly, you agree that you will comply with all Export Control Law and that the Software, or any part or information thereof, or any access or use thereof, will not be: (i) re exported, sold, or otherwise transferred outside the United States of America or to other countries or to any person in violation of Export Control Law or any other U.S. law; or (ii) made available to any person that you know or have reason to suspect will cause the Software, or any part or information thereof, or any access or use thereof, to be made available outside the United States of America or to other countries or to any person in violation of Export Control Law or any other U.S. law. You are solely responsible for determining its obligations under Export Control Law.
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
You agree that damages alone may be an insufficient remedy for violations of the terms of Sections III, VI, VII, IX, and XVIII of this Agreement, and that Gamesticky may suffer irreparable damage as a result of such a violation. Accordingly, Gamesticky shall be entitled, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of Sections III, VI, VII, IX, and XVIII of this Agreement, to seek injunctive relief (or equivalent relief available under the law of the jurisdiction where Gamesticky seeks such relief) to enforce the provisions of Sections III, VI, VII, IX, and XVIII of this Agreement without posting a bond. Injunctive (or such equivalent) relief shall be in addition to any and all other rights or remedies available to Gamesticky, including, but not limited to, damages or other relief or remedies for such violation. Assertion or the failure to assert injunctive (or such equivalent) relief shall not constitute a waiver of any such other rights or remedies. In the event it is necessary for Gamesticky to institute legal proceedings to enforce Sections III, VI, VII, IX, and XVIII of this Agreement, Gamesticky will be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Gamesticky in such proceedings if it prevails in such proceedings.
ASSIGNMENT/CHANGE OF CONTROL.
This Agreement may not be assigned, nor may any of your obligations under this Agreement be delegated, in whole or in part, by you by operation of law, merger, or any other means without Gamesticky’s express prior written consent and any attempted assignment without such consent will be null and void. Gamesticky may, without notice to you, assign this Agreement. Further, Gamesticky may perform all obligations, if any, to be performed by Gamesticky under this Agreement directly or may have some or all obligations performed by its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors.
SEVERABILITY.
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any clause of this Agreement to be unenforceable for any reason, that clause of this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.
The internal laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. (without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York, U.S.A. or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction) shall govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the matters or transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement and any disputes or controversies arising therefrom. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement or any transaction hereunder. You consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of competent state and federal courts in the State of New York, U.S.A., for any litigation or proceeding and to the venue of such litigation or proceeding in New York, New York, U.S.A.
