If you choose to make an in-app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with the mobile platform you are using (e.g., Apple, Android, etc.) ("your IAP Account"), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in-app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in-app purchases that apply to your IAP Account. The prices of Virtual Currencies will be displayed at the point of purchase. All charges and payments for Virtual Currencies will be made in the currency specified at the point of purchase through the relevant payment mechanism. Currency exchange settlements, foreign transaction fees, and payment channel fees, if any, are based on your agreement with the applicable payment provider.
Yalla Pay Center: the only third-party payment method we may, from time to time, approve to offer Virtual Currencies for purchase. Yalla Pay Center (https://www.yallapay.live/home), is an aggregation platform set up to support third-party payment for various Yalla products, providing users with convenient and safe third-party recharge services. If you choose to use Yalla Pay Center to recharge, you will need to create an account with Yalla Pay Center (“Yalla Pay Account”) according to Yalla Pay Center Terms of Service and Privacy and Cookie Policy.

All charges and payments for Virtual Currencies will be made in the currency specified at the point of purchase through the relevant payment mechanism.

3.Special description
Virtual Items and subscription services require users to purchase from officially approved channels such as App Store/Google Play or Yalla Pay Center,.
Handing over your account to others for operation, conducting private transactions with others, prohibited proxy recharge ( any purchase of Virtual Currencies through unofficial channels, or entrusting accounts to others to recharge on their behalf are strictly forbidden. The common types of prohibited proxy recharges (including but not limited to, purchase and recharge from nonofficial third-party recharge platforms, private transactions with third parties, and provision of user accounts to log in and recharge from third-party devices) or malicious refunds after recharging are all violations of the platform rules. These actions will disrupt the normal management of the platform, and will also put users’ accounts and personal information at risk including but not limited to the leakage of users’ information, fraudulent use of credit cards, failure of recharge, and the malicious theft of accounts. Moreover, these types of recharge and/or refunds are mostly scams, which can easily cause property damage. Yalla Parchis will always crack down on the aforementioned behaviors and maintain the right to pursue legal liabilities according to applicable law.
In response to the aforesaid violations, the platform has rights to take measures including but not limited to the following:
Take back all the virtual currency and purchased items in the account suspected of proxy charging or malicious refund.
Freeze all remaining virtual items in the account suspected of the malicious refund until the refund is canceled or the amount of refund is reimbursed in full.
Time-limited or permanent ban on the account.
We are not liable for any losses or damages caused by recharging on unofficial proxy recharge, malicious refunds, or account transactions.
You may cancel your account at any time, and Yalla Parchis may terminate your account in accordance with the Terms. All Virtual Currencies in your account will be forfeited immediately upon the cancellation or termination of your account. There will be no refunds for any unused or unredeemed Virtual Currencies.
