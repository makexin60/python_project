Privacy Policy
Effective Date:
April 1, 2024
We at Premise Data Corporation (“Premise”) know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn about personal information that is collected, used and shared by us. Any capitalized terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use:
https://tos.premise.com/terms-of-use/
.
By using or accessing the Service, including using our website, portals or platforms in any manner or downloading our mobile apps, reviewing or completing Tasks (as described in the Terms of Use) and signing up for the Premise Wallet, you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you consent to our collection, use and sharing of your personal information, including images, videos, recordings, photos and screen captures, in the ways listed below.
Understand Your Role With Us
Premise uses the terms “Customer,” “Contributor,” and “Visitor” in this policy to describe the different roles in relation to Premise and its services and environment. These roles are defined as follows:
Customer
: If you are someone who executes a Master Services Agreement or other client agreement with us (a “Customer Agreement”) (or an employee/consultant of a company that has executed such a Customer Agreement with us and you are accessing the Service in your employment/consultant capacity), or who is expressly authorized by Premise to access one of our online client-specific portals or platforms, you are referred to in this Privacy Policy as a Customer.
Contributor
: If you download our mobile applications, you are referred to in this Privacy Policy as a Contributor.
Visitor
: Everyone else is referred to as a Visitor.
The terms in Part I of this Privacy Policy apply to Customers, Contributors and Visitors. The terms in Part II apply if you are a Customer.  The terms in Part III apply if you are a Contributor.  The terms in Part IV apply to Contributors, Customers and Visitors who are California residents or other states that provide comparable rights.
PART I – TERMS FOR EVERYONE – CUSTOMERS, CONTRIBUTORS AND VISITORS
This Privacy Policy applies to the Premise apps, websites, platforms, and products and services available on or at the apps, websites or other online portals. Premise collects information about you when you install our mobile applications and through other interactions and communications you have with us through our online services (including our website, portals and platforms) or otherwise. Remember that your use of the Service is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. The Service is owned and operated by Premise, and this Privacy Policy applies to information collected, used and shared by Premise.
We may transfer the information described in this Privacy Policy to, and process and store it in, the United States, which may have a lower level of data protection laws than your country of residence. Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
We are constantly trying to improve the Service. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well. We will alert you to changes by sending you an in-app message, posting a notice on relevant social media platforms, posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website, platforms, portals and/or by some other means. Please note that if you have opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you have not provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Service, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy that is in effect at the time the information is collected.
SCOPE AND APPLICATION
This Privacy Policy applies to persons anywhere in the world who access or use any of the Services.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone who is under the age of 18 years, or the age of majority where that individual resides or is located when using the Service, whichever is lower (collectively, the “Age Minimum”). Please do not attempt to use the Service or send any personal information about yourself to us if you are younger than the Age Minimum, and please do not send any personal information about anyone else who is under the Age Minimum or under 13 years of age, whichever is lower. If we learn that we have collected personal information from someone under the Age Minimum or 13 years of age, whichever is lower, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a person under the Age Minimum or under 13 years of age, whichever is lower, may have provided us personal information, or if we have been provided personal information about someone who is under the Age Minimum or 13 years of age, whichever is lower, please contact us at privacy@premise.com.
COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION
Information We Collect Through Your Use of the Service
We collect information about how you interact with the Service, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases, we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may also collect information about your online activity after you leave the Service. This information allows us to improve the Service and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.
We also collect information you provide directly to us, as well as information you provide through use of third-party accounts.
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. The Service does not support browser “Do Not Track” requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave the Service. By using our Service, you expressly consent to this collection of information.
Google, Bing, and social media ads, and any other similar vendors with which Premise works, may collect or receive personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites from the Service and other apps, and use that information to provide measurement services and ads. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information for ad customization. You can opt out of Google Analytics by using the following add-on
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/
.
We use analytics to help analyze how our users use the Service. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often our users visit the Service, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Service. We may use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our Service or to send you promotional messages about our Service. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Service, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Where we are required to seek your consent to the use of non-essential cookies under applicable laws, we seek this consent through our cookie management tool.
Additional Information
Please review the sections below in this Privacy Policy that pertain to you for disclosures about additional information we collect.
RETENTION OF INFORMATION
We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
