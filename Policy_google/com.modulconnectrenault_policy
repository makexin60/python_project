Cookies
The Company uses so-called cookies on our websites. A cookie is a small text file sent from a website to your web browser. The cookie cannot identify you personally, but only the web browser that is installed on your computer and the web browser you use when visiting the webpage. Consequently, different cookies are saved on different computers, should you use different computers when visiting our websites. Cookies do not carry viruses and cannot destroy any other information stored on your computer.
Cookies are usually categorised based on their origin and based on whether they are stored in your web browser or not. Cookies can either be sent to you from the website you visit (i.e.
first-party cookie
) or from another organisation that delivers services to the current website, such as an analysts and statistical company (i.e.
third-party cookies
). Cookies can also be divided into
session cookies
and
permanent cookies
. A session cookie is sent to your computer so that the webpages can function properly during your visit and is not stored on your computer, but is erased when you close down your web browser. The function of a session cookie is for example that it is activated when you return to a previously visited part of the website and thus facilitates your navigation on the website. A permanent cookie, on the other hand, is stored in your web browser and thus allows a web page to recognise your computer’s IP address even if you turn off your computer or log out between visits. The cookie is stored for three days and is then deleted.
The Company uses both session cookies and permanent cookies on our website. Both types of cookies are needed primarily for the functionality of our services, to help us improve our delivery of products and services, to provide you with additional functionality or to help us provide you with relevant and customised advertisement/marketing. Furthermore, the Company could use third-party cookies from Google Analytics to investigate how to adapt and develop the information on the Company’s website in the best possible way.
Most web browsers have a default setting that accepts the use of cookies. You can easily refrain from allowing the Company’s websites to store cookies on your computer with a setting in your web browser, including blocking cookies or erasing any cookies stored on your computer. Please note that if you choose to not allow cookies, some functionality on our websites may cease to function securely and properly and some services may not be provided. For example you cannot log in to, or use the e-commerce. How you erase or change the settings for cookies is stated in the instructions to your web browser or in the utility function that usually is available in the web browser.
Changes to the privacy policy
Please note that the terms of the privacy policy may be changed or amended. Any new version will be published on the Company’s website. Consequently, you should review these terms on a regular basis to make sure that you are satisfied with the changes. In case of any material changes we will, however, e-mail you, if you have given us your e-mail address, to make you aware of any changes made.
If the changes concern processing of personal data that we carry out based on your consent, we will give you the opportunity to once again give your consent to the processing on the new terms presented.
