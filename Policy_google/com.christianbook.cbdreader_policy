â€œPersonal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code Â§ 1798.80(e))â€ including name, address, mobile telephone number, telephone number, fax number, bank account number, credit card number, and debit card number.
â€œProtected classification characteristics under California or federal lawâ€ including gender.
â€œInternet or other similar network activityâ€ including browsing history, search history, information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application, or advertisement, and referring website.
â€œGeolocation Dataâ€ including physical location or movements.
â€œInferences drawn from other personal informationâ€ including a person's preferences and affinities. While our focus is products, not people, the nature of our product line means that we also collect information which could suggest your interest in products that may be associated with a specific racial or ethnic category and/or set of religious or philosophical beliefs.
â€œPurchasing Historyâ€ â€“ we maintain a history of products you have purchased, rented, and/or returned.
We obtain Personal Information from the following categories of sources:
Directly from you including, without limitation, when you: (1) open an account; (2) complete and submit an order on our websites or from our catalogs; (3) request a catalog; (4) submit a customer review; (5) create a registry with a Gift Registry Service; (6) enter a contest; (7) communicate with customer service; (8) conduct a search; or (9) subscribe to a newsletter or customer alert. The information which we may receive and collect in connection with any of these activities includes contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address; credit card information; names and addresses of the parties to whom product is shipped; content of reviews and emails sent to us; and, your password.
Automatically from you and any devices, including mobile devices, each time you visit our websites through cookies, web beacons, unique identifiers, and other similar technologies, including Google Analytics.
Indirectly from you through observing your actions on our websites or from information your computer or mobile device transmits when interacting with our websites or mobile applications.
From the following categories of third party sources: Search Engines such as Google and Bing; Social Networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram; professional mailing list companies; mailing list exchanges and co-ops; postal and delivery services; fulfillment services; data analysis companies; and marketing, promotional, advertising, retargeting and remarketing service providers. Third parties may use cookies, pixels, unique identifiers and similar technologies for online behavioral advertising, remarketing and retargeting purposes. We receive and collect personal information from third parties which we add to your account, such as contact information.
We receive and collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, geolocation data, the browser and operating system you are utilizing, the date and time of your visit, the pages of the site which you visit, the Internet address of the website from which you linked to our site and any promotion identifiers contained in these links, and the Internet address of any website to which you link from our site. If you maintain an account with one of our websites and log onto the site using such account information, we also receive and collect your user identification number, user name, and password.
We also receive and collect certain information when you communicate to us by telephone, mail, fax, or email. We may request and receive a confirmation from you when you receive and open an email from us.
If you sign up for our text messaging program, cookies may be used to personalize your experience (e.g. send you personalized text messages such as shopping cart reminders).
Chat Technology:  Our site may offer a live customer service chat feature to respond to customer inquiries. These chat features collect personal information, including but not limited to email address and the content of chat communications. Conversations with live chat features are recorded.
Cookies and other identifiers
Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer. A cookie can be thought of as an Internet user's ID card. They let the website know when the user has returned. This lets the site bring up information relevant to that user, for example your name, past orders, etc.
Cookies make the interaction between users and websites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a website to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping cart or to remember the user's preferences or registration details for a future visit. We use cookies to allow customers to move from one part of the web site to another and to add items to the shopping cart without having to log in repeatedly.
We also use cookies to track visitors' interest in our products. We may use this to understand what most appeals to our customers so we can make our offers as appropriate as possible. Browsing behavior is also used to create relevant banner advertising with product recommendations that we believe best relate to the items you viewed on our website. These banners are then served across other websites that you may visit. This process is called behavioral advertising and although the ads are individually tailored to each visitor, all cookie data is anonymized and stored temporarily. We use the browsing behavior data to create personal product recommendations on our website, our marketing emails and in our printed catalog.
How we use Personal Information
We use the Personal Information which we collect for one or more of the following business purposes: process, track, and fulfill your order; communicate with you regarding your order; create a gift certificate; respond to a request for information; send you catalogs or promotional information and material, including information regarding products or services that may be of interest to you; send you newsletters, customer alerts, and email; communicate with you regarding products you have purchased; improve our websites; enhance our customer service; track customer preferences; improve and enhance our product selection; administer our loyalty programs; to protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our customers, and other third parties; to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us is among the assets transferred; and to respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
How we share Personal Information
We do not sell, disclose or otherwise provide Personal Information we collect to third parties except as described below.
We share, disclose and provide Personal Information with our subsidiary and affiliated companies which are owned or controlled by us or which are under common ownership and control with us.

Rewards Program
We share your name, order history, address, and payment details with our brand engagement partner when you sign up for our Rewards program for purposes of administering that program. You can read more about the terms of our Rewards program here:
https://www.christianbookrewards.com/program-terms
Christianbook offers a Rewards program for a set fee per month, following a trial period. Rewards participants receive benefits such as cash back from purchases and shipping rebates.
Please be advised that this program is available to you by Christianbook, LLC and is operated by Clarus Commerce LLC as a service provider of Christianbook on behalf of and for the benefit of Christianbook.

Please be advised that, once we comply with your request, the only personal information we will retain of yours is a record of your request itself. Your order history, name, and contact information will be deleted or anonymized along with the rest of your information, making it impossible to administer our program as we cannot tie you to any of your past orders.
If you visit a third party website that is operated and maintained by us on behalf of such third parties, your personal information may be shared with such third party.  These websites may be identified by the inclusion of the third partyâ€™s name in the URL such as www.thirdparty.christianbook.com where â€œthird partyâ€ would be replaced by the name or other identifier of the third party.
We may provide our mailing list (names, addresses, and/or email addresses) and information about individual shopping interests to other select companies whose products or services may be of interest to you including charitable and non-profit organizations.  We may also send you catalogs or other promotional materials on behalf of other companies.  See â€œWhat are my choices regarding my information?â€ below for your options regarding these other companies.
We may in the future sell some or all of our assets and/or business units, in which case, customer information may be one of the assets transferred.
We may disclose any information that we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority or to protect the health and safety of our employees or the general public.
How is Personal Information Secured?

How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights
When you contact us to exercise your rights to know, delete, or correct your personal information, we will verify your identity. We will then verify your request by asking you to confirm the action(s) to be taken by phone call or a response to an email. With a request to correct, we may require information from you to demonstrate that our data is incorrect. This information shall only be used and/or maintained by the business for the purpose of correcting your personal information and to comply with any record-keeping obligations we may have under the law.
You may use an authorized agent to exercise any of the rights above. In order to have an authorized agent exercise any of your rights on your behalf, you or your authorized agent must provide us with signed written permission from you to your authorized agent authorizing the agent to exercise these rights on your behalf or with a copy of a lawful power of attorney.

You may make a verifiable consumer request up to two times within a 12-month period, without charge. Unfortunately, we cannot respond to your request to delete or correct or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.

We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt, and an opt-out request/request to limit the use of sensitive information will be processed within 15 days. If we require more time to respond to a verifiable consumer request, we will inform you of the reason and extension time period (up to 90 days). If you have an account with us, we will deliver our response to the email associated with that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our response by mail or electronically, at your option. The response we provide will also explain any reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

You have a right to appeal any denial of a consumer right. If your request is denied in whole or in part, you have the right to appeal your decision within 30 days.
