How does Dynata use the information it collects?
Dynata's use of information:
In addition to the purposes described above, Dynata uses personal data collected through the Application/Services as follows: (i) to communicate with you regarding your membership with a survey panel(s) owned by Dynata; (ii) to communicate with you regarding your participation in a survey(s); (iii) to tailor survey opportunities to you and to arrange for advertisements to be displayed to you outside the Application/Services for the purposes of facilitating the completion of advertisement recall surveys; (iv) to send you notifications of survey opportunities; (v) to comply with any and all legal obligations, including, without limitation, tax obligations; (vi) to administer and manage Dynata's reward and incentive programs and fulfill your requests for rewards and incentives; (vii) to facilitate your entry into Dynata's sweepstakes and promotions and communicate with you regarding such entries; (viii) to update Dynata's records; (ix) to comply with any data suppression obligations or requirements; (x) for fraud detection and/or prevention purposes; (xi) to link your device and/or profile to additional information available about you and/or your device available from data management platforms ("DMP"); (xii) to market Dynata products/services to you; (xiii) to enable third parties to market their products/services to you; (xiv) to enable Dynata or third parties to develop marketing insights and/or audience/look alike models; (xv) to validate the profile information you provided to us; and/or (xvi) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Policy or as otherwise authorized by you.

With respect to the linking of Application/Services data to third party DMP data, Dynata uses such data itself and/or permits Dynata's clients and/or the DMP itself to use such data to provide you with survey opportunities, to measure advertising effectiveness (as described in more detail below), to segment audiences; to design advertising campaigns using "look alike" cohort groups based on survey and third party data; and/or to market such third party's products/services to you.
Retargeting
. Dynata may from time-to-time engage a third party or third parties to either display advertising on an Dynata website(s) or to manage Dynata's advertising on other websites (for example on social media sites). Dynata's third party partner(s) may use technologies such as cookies or identifying data elements. Including but not limited to your IDFA or Advertising ID to gather information about your activities on Dynata's website(s) and/or on other websites in order to: (i) provide you with advertising about Dynata and its services and/or (ii) assist Dynata in developing marketing and advertising campaigns designed to target individuals who have a social and demographic profile similar to your social and demographic profile. If Dynata is conducting a re-targeting program and you wish to not participate in this re-targeting program, please opt-out via the applicable cookie opt-out process set forth in this Privacy Policy or in Dynata's separate cookie notice, by modifying your IDFA or Advertising ID and/or by unsubscribing within the advertisement itself.
Audience Insights/Look-alikes
. Dynata and/or third parties may use Personal Data and/or may link Personal Data to a third-party cookie to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with marketing campaigns.
Online Advertising Effectiveness
. In connection with Dynata's online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding ads, promotions, content, campaigns, and/or websites that Dynata is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, Dynata's clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a "
Third Party Technology
" and collectively the "
Third Party Technologies
"). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, Dynata's servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and Dynata's client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, Dynata's client will send your UID and the specific survey to Dynata and Dynata will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey.
Audience Measurement Data
. In addition to the use and sharing of Audience Measurement Data (as defined below) in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, as such research is described above, Dynata may share your UID and data previously collected by Dynata, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, ("
Audience Measurement Data
"), to third parties, including, without limitation, Dynata's subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the content, advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, and to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).
How do advertisers/ad networks use my information?
Ad partners' use of information.
You can use the Application/Services to participate in surveys, including, without limitation, surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that Dynata is testing for its business clients. You may see these ads or promotions in several places, including, without limitation, in non-Dynata mobile apps (for example, in a gaming app), after which Dynata shall provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about the ad or promotion that you were exposed to. To facilitate the completion of surveys on ads or promotions, Dynata has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including, without limitation, in many other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides these ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and many or all of the other types of information described in the "
Information collected through automated means
" section above (including your ongoing geolocation, if your device permits the collection of geolocation). Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Dynata is testing for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Dynata that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Dynata to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. With your consent, the ad companies also use the information they collect about your device and your interactions with the Application/Services and other mobile apps to provide you with other in-app advertising that has been tailored to your interests and for other purposes.

(viii) In connection with a change of ownership or control, including, without limitation, a merger or an acquisition of any or all of Dynata's business assets, provided that the party receiving or acquiring the personal data agrees to use, protect, and maintain the security, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data in accordance with this Policy;
(ix) to a client or to such client's customer in the event Dynata or a third party believes that you have or may violate the intellectual property rights of a third party;

(xii) As otherwise permitted pursuant to this Policy.
In addition to the foregoing, if you enroll through a third party with whom Dynata has a contractual relationship and/or from an email sent from a third party company proposing you to join our Application/Services (collectively "Program Partner"), Dynata may share select enrollment information with the Program Partner who invited you into the program, which can include your full name, post or zip code, and your email address. You acknowledge that our Program Partner may collect, use, and disclose that information in accordance with their privacy policy. Please note that Dynata will not be responsible for and will not be liable for our Program Partner's actions concerning your information or for any Program Partner's privacy practices when you are dealing directly with them.
Please note, Dynata may allow a client to collect PII directly from respondents. The disclosure is voluntary and, prior to collection, the client is required to enter into a written agreement with Dynata, which, among other things, limits use of the PII.
Dynata may license certain PII to third parties (e.g., data brokers, data aggregators, etc.) for their own Non-Research Purposes, including, without limitation, the licensing of individual-level and/or aggregated-level data (e.g., product and/or service purchasing or usage activity, social media activity, website visitation data, internet search history, etc.) for the development of audience insights and/or look-alike models, for the purpose of sale of such data to the third party's clients/customers for the purpose of performing analytics and providing marketing intelligence and/or to enable such third party to market its products/services to you.
Additionally, UIDs and information collected by automated means are provided to third parties, including, without limitation, clients, partners, agents and/or vendor for the purposes of identifying respondents for re-contact surveys or communications, fraud detection and/or prevention, database matching, data validation, data append, coding, data segmentation, and reward, incentive, and/or sweepstakes or promotion related services.
In connection with your survey data, Dynata or the client may associate certain demographic attributes to you. Dynata may share with third parties, including but not limited to clients, the geographic and/or demographic data Dynata collects from you during enrolment or through certain profile questions Dynata may ask you. Such data may be shared with third parties on an individual respondent level or aggregate summary form (i.e. a group of respondents). If you voluntarily disclose personal data in connection with your survey data and responses, and Dynata collects the survey data and responses, Dynata will transfer the survey data and responses, UID and the voluntarily disclosed personal data to the relevant Dynata client.

Information from You
You may provide information manually while using our Services, for example, by typing your name and email address or by using a social profile to register for or update an account in one of the InMarket Applications
or by uploading purchase receipts through one of the InMarket Applications
. Some InMarket Applications allow you to link to your banking or payment card accounts via a third party provider; however, we do not collect your account number or payment card number. We also collect personal information when you communicate with us, including for support or when you register for a promotion.
Information from our Services
Our Services may collect personal and device information through the InMarket Applications, our Third Party Partners’ mobile applications, and our websites. Our Services and our Third Party Partners may also collect data using technology such as cookies, ad tags, and pixels. Pixels are invisibly embedded electronic images and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use cookies to store this type of information when we serve ads onto Internet browsers. Some of our partners send us information directly via a “server to server” file instead of using web technologies like cookies, ad tags, and pixels. We also collect mobile advertising identifiers (IDFA for Apple devices or AAID for Android devices), third party proprietary identifiers, ad exposure information such as URL, site name, creative, publisher, and channel, precise geolocation information, session information, operating system, internet protocol address (IP address), hashed email address, device model and settings, and related statistical identifiers. All of these technologies help us (and Third Party Partners) to deliver relevant ads, provide ad measurement and reporting, and to generate market insights.
Information from Third Party Sources
We may also collect information about you and your device from third party sources including public databases, social media platforms, data append services, third party marketing partners, data brokers, and others. The information we collect from third party sources may include categories such as demographic information, predicted interests or characteristics, and commercial information. We combine this third party data with the personal information that we have collected.

The information we collect from third party sources may include categories such as demographic information, predicted interests or characteristics, and commercial information. We combine this third party data with the personal information that we have collected.
Categories of Personal Information Collected
InMarket collects, and has collected in the past 12 months, the following categories of personal information:
(a) personal identifiers (for example, your name (either first, last or both), email address, postal address, phone number, mobile advertising identifier, persistent IP address, and persistent cookie ID);
(b) customer records information;
(c) protected class characteristics (for example, gender);
(d) commercial information (for example, shopping lists, purchase transaction receipts, purchase histories and tendencies). We collect your purchase transaction details when, for example, you connect your bank account or payment card with an InMarket Application or a participating partner application. The categories of data include vendor category, transaction date and time, amount, merchant name, merchant description, merchant location, financial institution name, last two to four digits of your account number, and personal finance category. However, we do not collect, store, or use consumer’s actual bank account numbers or credit/debit card numbers.
(e) internet activity information (for example, information regarding your interactions with a website, mobile application or advertisement, device operating system and settings, browser type‚ referring website, the pages viewed on the website or application, and the application name and version, social profile data);
(f) precise geolocation information, which is a category of “Sensitive Personal Information” or “Sensitive Data” under certain state privacy laws; and
(g) Inferences drawn from personal information (for example, to build audience attributes such as health food purchaser, discount shopper, fast food customer).
Notice of Financial Incentives
InMarket offers financial incentives to consumers in exchange for voluntarily sharing certain personal information with us through websites and mobile applications we own, such as CheckPoints.
In the CheckPoints mobile application, consumers can earn points redeemable in a rewards program in exchange for various activities such as sharing precise geolocation information (for example, by visiting a retail location), scanning product barcodes in a retail location, sharing purchase records, taking surveys, and sharing personal information such as name and email address. The specific instructions for how to participate and the rewards offered as incentives in each mobile application may vary and are set out within each mobile application.
We collect and use the information we obtain through the InMarket Applications to serve users and customers in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We offer an incentive to consumers who provide us with information through the InMarket Applications. InMarket receives a nominal fee for certain completed surveys in the CheckPoints mobile application, which is the basis upon which we value this CheckPoints survey information. Regarding the rest of the data for which we offer an incentive in the InMarket Applications, one consumer’s data has nominal value to us because in large data sets that also include data collected without incentive, the utility and value of the set is only nominally enhanced by the inclusion of one additional entry.
To participate in any of these incentive-based offers you can opt in by intentionally sharing the required information through the InMarket Applications.
You can opt out of participation in any of our incentive-based offers at any time. If you wish to opt out, stop submitting additional information and please submit a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” request or a “Delete My Personal Information” request as described below in this Privacy Policy. You may also delete the mobile application.

How do advertisers/ad networks use my information?
Ad partners' use of information.
You can use the Application/Services to participate in surveys, including, without limitation, surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that Dynata is testing for its business clients. You may see these ads or promotions in several places, including, without limitation, in non-Dynata mobile apps (for example, in a gaming app), after which Dynata shall provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about the ad or promotion that you were exposed to. To facilitate the completion of surveys on ads or promotions, Dynata has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including, without limitation, in many other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides these ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and many or all of the other types of information described in the "
Information collected through automated means
" section above (including your ongoing geolocation, if your device permits the collection of geolocation). Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Dynata is testing for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Dynata that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Dynata to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. With your consent, the ad companies also use the information they collect about your device and your interactions with the Application/Services and other mobile apps to provide you with other in-app advertising that has been tailored to your interests and for other purposes. To learn more about some of these ad companies, including how to opt out, please visit the following:

Additionally, UIDs and information collected by automated means are provided to third parties, including, without limitation, clients, partners, agents and/or vendor for the purposes of identifying respondents for re-contact surveys or communications, fraud detection and/or prevention, database matching, data validation, data append, coding, data segmentation, and reward, incentive, and/or sweepstakes or promotion related services.
