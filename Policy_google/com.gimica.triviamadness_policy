When contacting our Data Protection Officer, please specify the company to which your request relates. Please refrain from enclosing sensitive information such as a copy of an identification document with your request.
2. Data collection regarding the use of our apps
We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
When you download our apps, register, or log in to the apps and use the apps, certain personal data is processed.
Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.
2.1 Access to and storage of information in terminal equipment
By using our apps, access to information (e.g., IP address) or storage of information (e.g., cookies or similar technologies) in your terminal equipment may occur. This access or storage may involve further processing of personal data pursuant to the GDPR.
​
In cases where such access to information or such storage of information is strictly necessary for the technically error-free delivery of our services, this is done based on § 25 para. 1 s. 1, para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG.
In cases where such a process serves other purposes (e.g., the needs-based design of our apps), this will only be carried out based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG with your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
​
For more information on the processing of your personal data and the relevant legal basis in this context, please refer to the following sections on the specific processing activities in our apps.
2.2 Information collected during download of the apps.
When you download the apps, certain required information is transmitted to the app store you have selected (Google Play Store, Apple App Store). In particular, IP address, unique device ID, location, date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), content of the request (specific page), access status/HTTP status code, amount of data transmitted in each case, app usage data, operating system and its interface language. We have no influence on this data collection and are not responsible for it. The contract is concluded with the respective provider of the store and is handled in accordance with their terms and conditions as well as their privacy policy. Within the scope of your use of the stores, we only process the reviews and associated data published by you on our apps and receive anonymous statistics via the stores, e.g., on download figures, uninstalls and crashes.
2.3 Data processing when using the apps.
As part of your use of the apps, we collect certain data as outlined in detail as below that is required for the provision and use of the apps. The following data is processed for these purposes: internal device ID, version of your operating system, time of access, IP address, content of access, country of access.
​
This data is collected in order to provide you with the service and related functions and to prevent and resolve misuse and malfunctions. To do so we use our service provider IPQualityScore, LLC to estimate fraud risks and our service provider Ipregistry: PSI IPV Ltd, Oxford, UK to determine the country from which a user logs in based on the IP address.
​
If you use the JustPlay app, we collect information on your progress in the different game apps of Gimica as well as your advertising data (see below) and connect this data with you via identifiers (GAID / Google App Set ID/ IDFA / IDFV / JustPlay User ID). To do so we use our service provider AppLovin Corporation, 1100 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304.
​
This data processing is justified by the necessity of the processing for the performance of the contract between you as the data subject and us pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR for the use of the apps and by our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in ensuring the functionality and error-free operation of the apps.
​
Our apps are hosted by an external service provider. We use Google Cloud Services, offered by Google Cloud EMEA Ltd., as a hosting service provider that processes data on servers in several global locations. Personal data collected through the apps is stored on the hoster's servers. We have concluded a Data Processing Agreement with the provider in accordance with the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR, in which they commit to protect the data of our customers and not to pass them on to third parties.
​
For using more functions of the apps, you are asked to provide us with certain other data. Such data will only be sent and provided to us after you clicked the respective submit button within the apps.
​
If you are using additional payout options in our apps we may ask for your full name and address details and pass this information to the external payment service provider. The payment providers are either PayPal: 2211 N 1st St, San Jose, CA, USA, Tangocard: 4700 42nd Ave SW #430, United States or Tremendous: 592 Union St Ste 502, San Francisco, California, 94123, United States. However, please note that we do not process your payment data and bank account details but use external providers that handle the payments.
For the purpose of managing our customers, we may process user data in internally used systems. We base this data processing on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b. and f. GDPR. We use our service providers Google Cloud EMEA Ltd., 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, Ireland and Metabase, Inc 9740 Campo Rd. Suite 1029, Spring Valley, CA 91977 for this purpose.
​
You may request the deletion and change of entered data any time via message to
dataprotection@justplayapps.com
. Please note that this might not apply to data whose processing is needed for legitimate needs. This is in accordance with the “right to erasure” of GDPR.
​
If the data processed for providing the apps services are considered personal data, such data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) b. or f. GDPR for the purpose of providing our service and analysing those data based on our legitimate interests of improving our product and research purposes.
​
2.4 Technical functions of the apps
Only if further functions of the apps are to be used in addition to the basic functions, the following accesses can be requested:
Push Notifications: Push notifications are sent to keep you informed about various aspects of the app. Specifically, you will receive notifications regarding:
Status changes in your earnings.
Reminders related to your account or activities.
Updates to the app or its features.
Promotions and offers that may be of interest to you.
The permissions to access the above function are explicitly requested and can be confirmed or denied. Please be aware that with older OS versions explicit requests for push notifications might not occur, but are allowed by default.
​
If you have granted the individual permission, the associated processing of your data is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time for the future. A granted authorization can be cancelled in the settings of the device in most cases at any time (however, this depends on the device and the operating system, which we have no influence on). The lawfulness of the data processing already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation. Please note that permissions that have not been granted may restrict the use of the apps.
2.5 Contact via contact form, e-mail.
If you send us requests via our contact form or email, your details from the contact form or email, including the contact data you have provided there, will be stored for the purpose of processing your request and in the event of follow-up questions. Under no circumstances will we pass on this data without your consent. The legal basis for processing the data is our legitimate interest in responding to your request pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR and, if applicable, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, provided that your request is aimed at concluding a contract.
​
You can object to the processing of your personal data at any time in the case of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
We may also contact you via app/email for purposes related to the use of the Apps or similar services based on Art. 6 (1) b. or f. GDPR.

​
Please note that JustPlay GmbH is the sole controller for the data processing described below.
You can download our apps from the app store without registering with us. Personal data is not collected for us in the course of downloading the apps. Nor is any personal data passed on to us by the apps store provider. If you want to use pay out functionalities, further details are required to process the payment. The processing of the payment is handled by external payment service providers.
​
The user payment data is transferred to the payment provider.
​
The data entered during the payout is processed for the fulfilment of a contract with the user or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).  Additional voluntary information is processed on the basis of your voluntarily given consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent with effect for the future at any time. For this purpose, an informal e-mail to the contact details of the controller mentioned at the beginning of this privacy policy is sufficient. The lawfulness of the data processing already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.
​
If you register via Facebook (facebook.com) or Google (Google login) we process your email address and name from your user profile on Facebook after you have clicked the respective button. For further details on data processing on Facebook please refer to:
https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy
You have the right to change the email address via message to
dataprotection@justplayapps.com

2.7 Technical functions
Only if further functions of the JustPlay app are to be used in addition to the basic functions, the following accesses can be requested:
Camera Access:
The app requests access to your device’s camera for the purposes described in the Facial Mapping Notice and Consent Policy below.
Location Access:
​
The app requires access to your location data to determine your market for a more tailored user experience. Additionally, location data is used for security and fraud prevention purposes to ensure the integrity of user accounts and transactions.
The permissions to access the above functions are explicitly requested and can be confirmed or denied.
If you have granted the individual permission, the associated processing of your data is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time for the future. A granted authorization can be cancelled in the settings of the device in most cases at any time (however, this depends on the device and the operating system, which we have no influence on). The lawfulness of the data processing already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation. Please note that permissions that have not been granted may restrict the use of the apps.
​
3. Data transfer and recipients
Your personal data is not transferred to third parties, unless
we have explicitly pointed this out in the description of the respective data processing.
you have given your explicit consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
the transfer pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims and our legitimate interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms.
there is a legal obligation to transfer data pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR, and
required by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR for the execution of contractual relationships with you.
​
​
In addition, we use external service providers for the processing of our services, whom we have carefully selected and commissioned in writing. They are bound by our instructions and are regularly monitored by us. Required data processing agreements pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR are concluded before the commission. In particular, these contracts concern app-hosting services, the dispatch of emails and IT updates and maintenance.
​
When you use our apps, your data may also be processed in third countries outside the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) without an adequate level of data protection, e.g., in the U.S., especially if you have consented to a transfer of your data to our advertising partners.
​
To ensure an adequate level of data protection when transferring your data to third countries, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission are concluded in accordance with Art. 46 (2) lit. c DSGVO. They oblige the recipient of the data to process it in accordance with the European level of protection. A copy of the standard contractual clauses can be requested via the contact channels indicated above.
​
If the standard data protection clauses alone are not sufficient to ensure the level of protection, additional technical, contractual or organizational measures are taken to safeguard the transfer of data. Furthermore, it is regularly reviewed and evaluated whether these additional measures continue to ensure a sufficient level of data protection or whether further supplementary measures may need to be taken.
​
To the extent that we grant other parties access to information collected via our apps, they are expected to follow privacy practices no less protective than our practices to the extent allowed by applicable law.
4. Storage period
The period for which the personal data will be stored is determined by the relevant statutory storage periods (e.g., from commercial law and tax law) or as indicated within this privacy policy and the attached Facial Mapping Notice and Consent Policy. The corresponding data is deleted routinely upon expiry of the respective period. If data is required for the fulfilment of a contract or contract initiation, or if we have a legitimate interest in further storage, the data will be deleted if they are no longer required for these purposes or if you make use of your right of withdrawal or objection. Your profile and account data are deleted after you deleted such data in your apps account or deleted the entire account via the respective button in the apps, which is more or less immediately after such deletion according to our deletion routines.
​
5. Cookies
Our apps use so-called “cookies” and similar technologies.
Cookies and similar technologies have various functions. They are technically necessary, as certain apps functions would not work without them. Some are used to evaluate user behaviour or display advertising.
​
The processing of data using strictly necessary cookies or similar technologies is based on § 25 para. 1 s. 1, para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG and a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the technically error-free delivery of our services.
