PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you utilize our services. It also explains your privacy rights and the legal protections afforded to you. We are committed to safeguarding the personal information of our users and their contacts.
By using our services, you consent to the collection, use, sharing, and processing of your personal information as described in this policy. We use your personal data to enhance and deliver our services effectively.
PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED
Types of Data Collected:
Personal Information User Provide
User Input Text for Translation: The app collects text entered by users for translation purposes. This text is processed locally within the app to deliver translation results.
Voice Input for Translation: When using the voice-to-text feature, the app collects audio data to convert spoken words into text. This conversion happens locally on the device to ensure user privacy. The resulting text is then used for translation purposes.
Clipboard Text: If users paste text into the app that was previously copied to the clipboard, the app collects this text to provide translations. This enables quick and convenient translation of text copied from other sources.
Language Preferences: The app collects user preferences regarding input and output languages. This information is used to specify the source and target languages for translations and improve usability.
Images for Text Extraction: The app collects images that users either select from their device storage or capture using their device camera for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and translation. The images are processed locally to extract text for translation purposes.
Note:
All information collected by the Voice Translator App is processed locally and used solely within the app to provide translations. No personal data is stored or transmitted externally to any servers or third parties, ensuring that user privacy is maintained at all times.
Information Collected Automatically
The app may automatically collect certain information when you use it to enhance performance, understand user interactions, and support the functionality of various features.
Screen Text via Accessibility Service: Voice Translator App utilizes Android's Accessibility Service to enable real-time text translation across all applications on your device. By enabling this service, the app can read and capture text that is currently displayed on your screen. This feature allows you to translate text from any app or web page without copying or pasting.
The Accessibility Service is only used to detect and capture on-screen text for the sole purpose of providing translation functionality to the user;
Data Processing: All text captured by the Accessibility Service is processed locally on your device. The text is immediately translated and displayed to you within the app interface;
No Data Collection or Storage: We do not collect, store, or transmit any text, personal data, or translation history to external servers. All translations occur locally on your device, and no data is stored or shared with third parties.
Device Data: We collect data about the device you use to access our services, including IP address, device model, operating system, screen resolution, mobile carrier, time zone settings and network type.
Crash and Performance Data: If the app crashes or encounters an error, data such as device logs and error reports may be collected to diagnose and resolve technical issues.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies: Our services utilize cookies to collect information to enhance user experience, understand user engagement and improve our services.
Data Obtained from Third Parties
In certain scenarios, the Translator App may obtain additional data from third-party services to enhance functionality and provide a seamless experience.
Text Data from Third-Party Input Methods: If you use third-party input methods or services (e.g., Google Voice Input or external translation APIs), the app may collect the translated text to display results locally. No personal data is shared with these services unless required for translation functionality.
Camera and Image Processing Services: If the app uses third-party OCR or image recognition libraries, data from captured or uploaded images may be sent to these services for processing. This is done securely, and the data is not stored after processing.
Other Sources: Data about you may also be collected from publicly available sources to further enhance our services and customer understanding.
