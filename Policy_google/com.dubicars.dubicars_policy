[The Service Fee payable to Dubicars for the Purchase Assist Service is deemed earned upon receipt and shall not be refundable.]
A. Purchase of Vehicle.
Dubicars will serve as the intermediary/facilitator between you and the Seller and Dubicars will handle all communications with respect to the chosen Vehicles(s) with the Seller and relevant Service Providers to make your purchase efficient and seamless.
Dubicars is not affiliated with any Seller and does not take a position on whether you should, or should not, purchase the Vehicle. Dubicars [does not verify that the Seller is legally authorized to sell the Vehicle] and is not responsible for any representations made by the Seller. The information posted on the Website by the Seller with respect to any vehicle is the sole responsibility of the Seller. Dubicars is not involved in and does not review or verify any advertising post placed on the Website by the Seller. Dubicars disclaims all liable for any false, misleading or incorrect information posted on the Website by the Seller.
B. Inspection.
Inspection of the vehicle chosen by the Buyer shall be completed by a third-party inspection company and is only guaranteed for 14 days from the time the inspection was made. If the odometer reading changes between the date of the inspection until the date the Buyer purchases his/her vehicle, Dubicars shall not be held responsible. In the event the car is purchased after 14 days from the initial inspection; another inspection is recommended and the inspection fees for the subsequent inspection shall be payable by the Buyer prior to the inspection.
The Purchase Assist Services include the provision of inspection services for up to two (2) selected Vehicles. The inspection services shall be carried out by a Service Provider from the list of inspection Service Providers selected by Dubicars.  The Service Provider shall inspect the selected Vehicle based on what the inspectors can subjectively observe. The inspection service shall not include a complete and total inspection of the Vehicle. The inspectors will not use hoists or tools to dismantle the vehicles. The inspection service is a visual inspection of all reasonably accessible items only and some problems may not be observable during the inspection, and only includes an on- site evaluation of the vehicle’s engine, tires, odometer and interior.  Furthermore, the Inspection shall not include checking or verifying the history of the Vehicle (including but not limited to previous accident history, information about the previous owner(s) of the Vehicle, and jurisdictional information such as where and when the Vehicle was previously purchased, etc.). The Service Provider shall provide the Buyer with a report including the vehicle description, general conditions, specs, warranties, summary, pictures, etc. Where possible, the inspectors will test drive the vehicle, but if this is not feasible, a test drive will not be conducted.  Dubicars is only facilitating the Vehicle inspection services on your behalf and is not liable for any incorrect or deficient inspection reports.
The inspection is only guaranteed for 14 days from the time the inspection was made. Because a Vehicle's condition may change between the time the inspection is conducted and the actual purchase of the Vehicle, we recommend having the inspection completed as close in time to the purchase as possible. In case the vehicle is purchased after 14 days from the initial inspection; another inspection is recommended and an additional fee shall be paid by the Buyer.  Therefore, we recommend that the Buyer be careful and that he/she exercises good judgment when making any purchase through the Website.
Vehicle Remains "As Is"
Because the vehicle being inspected is a "used" vehicle, you agree that, even after inspection, you will be purchasing the vehicle in an "as is" condition, unless otherwise warranted by the Seller.
The inspection report is not a substitute for any safety or other inspections that may be required by applicable laws in your jurisdiction. You acknowledge and agree that the inspection does create any warranty for any vehicle you may purchase and that your right to recover for any defects in the vehicle, whether or not disclosed in the inspection report, is limited to any warranty the Seller may offer.

4. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
4.1
You consent that we may share your Personal Information in connection with the purposes above with any other Dubicars or ControlAuto affiliated company.
4.2
You consent to us sharing your Personal Information with third parties in the following circumstances:
• selected dealerships registered with the Website or other service providers that we use, where asked to do so or it is an implicitly inherent part of your use of the Website. For example, when you use the Website to enquire about a vehicle of interest to you that is listed on the Website, we will pass your Personal Information to the dealership handling that vehicle sale or rental. Upon receipt of your Personal Information, the relevant third party is the data controller and their use of your information will be governed by their own terms of use and privacy policy; and
• business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you.
4.3
You further consent that we may also share your Personal Information with third parties:
• in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your Personal Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, along with its professional advisers. If ControlAuto or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Information held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;
• if required in order to obtain professional advice;
• if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or
• to protect the rights, property, or safety of Dubicars or ControlAuto, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection
