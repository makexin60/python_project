Privacy Policy
I, Vadim Turko, built the Material Lightmeter app as a Free app. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
Information Collection and Use
When using this app no personal data is collected. All settings such as theme, calibration values and other preferences are stored only on your device and never sent over the Internet.
Log Data
I want to inform you that whenever you use Lightmeter app, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app, the time and date of your use of the App, and other statistics.
Links to Other Sites
This app contains links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
