Children’s Privacy
There are no third-party ads in our apps, but we do cross promote our other products or the products on our related companies. The only third party service providers we use in our apps are to support our internal operations and we do not collect anything that is personally identifiable in our apps for children.
                                To help us provide you with the best service, we work with third party analytics providers Firebase and Crashlytics in our apps for children. These companies help us to understand your use of the apps. In association with them, we may collect your unique device identifier, IP address, mobile phone carrier, game progress, time spent playing, and achievements. This information is for internal use only and can’t be shared. It’s just for us to help us improve our services for you.
                                If you have any questions about our collection and use please contact us at support@vkidsapp.com.

More About Personal Data
We collect personal data when a parent makes a purchase through our online store, subscribes to a newsletter or alert, submits content to a forum or blog, or requests technical support. This data may include a name (screen or nickname), gender, birth date, email address, mailing or shipping address, telephone number, and payment information. This information may be used to provide services and the sites to you, to process and fulfill your orders, to contact parents about their orders and new services and features and to send push notifications if consent to receive them has been given. If you contact us for help we will only use your email address to reply to your question.  Please note that if a parent posts personal information about themselves in a community forum or blog in the parent section, in addition to being collected, this data is made public for others to see. The parent is responsible for the disclosure of any such data in those forums. More about Non Personal Data
We may use cookies and web beacons to help deliver and analyze our services (e.g., by counting the number of times a page or advert has been viewed).
Vkids may also use third parties from time to time to deliver a service to parents only, such as payment processing, sending emails, infrastructure and IT services, or helping with customer or technical support. We only work with companies that follow this privacy policy and agree not to use your information for any other purposes. If you’d like more information on this, please contact us at support@vkidsapp.com.
A Word About What We Might Disclose
As you can see, we collect minimal personal data, and some nonpersonal data for internal use only or in conjunction with third parties to help us operate, analyze, and improve our sites and services. In addition, we may disclose your personal or nonpersonal information to additional parties if we believe we are required to by law, by a judicial proceeding, to protect Vkids’s rights and properties, or to investigate fraud, intellectual property infringement, and any other conduct that might be illegal or expose Vkids or a user of its services to legal liability. In addition, Vkids may disclose information collected from a parent in the event of a change or proposed change in the ownership of the company; for example, a sale, a merger, or bankruptcy.
Parents may disclose information about themselves by posting in the public forums on the site. Vkids is not responsible for what parents say and post in these sections
Tracking
We use Firebase Features to better understand the use of our website for parents. These features include Remarketing, Impression reporting, integration with DoubleClick and Demographic & Interest reporting. They use cookies and anonymous identifiers to collect information and help target advertising. We do not combine this information with any personally identifiable information you may have submitted when signing up to a newsletter for example.
You can also configure your browser to accept or reject cookies. All browsers are different so go to the help section of your browser to find out how to do this.
Links
We may include links to third parties from our website or services. Vkids isn’t responsible for these companies and including a link to them doesn’t mean that Vkids endorses them. So be sure to check their privacy policies if you decide to visit them. And remember, your use of Vkids’s sites and services may also be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of other services that Vkids doesn’t control such as mobile application stores, mobile software platforms, online social media sites, or payment processors.
Security
Vkids uses generally accepted security measures and safeguards in an attempt to keep the data it collects secure and requires that the third parties it works with agree to do the same. The measures and safeguards include limiting access to the data to those persons who need it to complete their work for Vkids, using a fire-wall protected environment, and storing personal information in secure operating environments. That said, Vkids cannot and does not guarantee and does not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
Data Retention
User data is retained as long as it is necessary to provide the service. Data is deleted from our records when it is no longer needed within a reasonable timeframe.
