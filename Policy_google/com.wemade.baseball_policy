YOUR DUTY AND RIGHTS IN RELATION TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Your duty to inform us of changes
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and up to date. If you become aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that the information may be updated or corrected.
Your rights in connection with personal data
You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to the following rights:
Right to be informed.
This right allows you to know what personal data we collect about you, why we collect it, who collects it, how long it will be stored, and who we share it with, amongst other things. Through this Privacy Policy, we are informing you of this processed information.
Right of access to your personal data.
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Right to correct or rectify your personal data.
This right gives you the right to ask us to correct anything that you think is wrong with the personal data we have about you and to complete any incomplete personal data.
Right to deletion of your personal data.
This is called the right to erasure, the right to deletion, or the "right to be forgotten." This right means you can ask for your personal data to be deleted. Sometimes we can delete your information, but other times it is not possible for either technical or legal reasons. If that is the case, we will consider if we can limit the ways we use it. We will also inform you of our reason for denying your deletion request.
Right to restrict processing of your personal data.
This is the right to ask us to only use or store your personal data for certain purposes. You have this right in certain instances, such as where you believe the data is inaccurate or the processing activity is unlawful.
Right to data portability.
This is the right to request we move or transfer your personal data, in a machine-readable form. It is the right to ask for and receive a portable copy of your personal data that you have given us so that you can move it, copy it, keep it for yourself and/or transfer it to another organization.
Right to object to the processing of your personal data by us.
This is your right to tell us to stop using your personal data. You have this right when you rely on a legitimate interest of ours (or of a third party). You may also object at any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. We will stop processing the relevant personal data unless: (i) we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, or freedoms; or (ii) we need to continue processing your personal data to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.
Right to withdraw your consent.
In case that the processing of your personal data is based on the legal basis of consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing before you withdrew your consent. It will also not affect processing performed on other lawful grounds.
If you wish to make a complaint about how we process your personal data, please contact us and we will endeavor to handle your request as soon as possible. You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your information is unlawful. If you are in the EU, you can find the supervisory authority for your country and how to contact them in
https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en
. If you are in the UK, the supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner's Office, whom you can contact in
https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/your-personal-information-concerns
.
How you can exercise your rights:
To exercise any of your rights, please contact us by using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy. When submitting a privacy request, please describe your relationship with us and provide sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to you.
We may need to request specific personal data from you to help us verify your identity. This is another appropriate security measure to ensure, for example, that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
If you wish to submit a request on behalf of another person, please provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are authorized by that person to make the request on their behalf.
How we will respond to your request:
We will confirm the receipt of your request within 10 business days, and, in that communication, we will also describe our identity verification process (if needed) and when you should expect a response unless we have already granted or denied the request.
Please allow us up to a month for us to reply to your requests from the day we received your request. If we need more time (up to 90 days in total), we will inform you of the reason and the extension period in writing.
If we cannot satisfy a request, we will explain why in our response to you. For data portability requests, we will choose a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without difficulty.
We will generally not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests. However, we may charge a fee if we determine that your request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. In those cases, we will tell you why we made that determination and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly when we are unable to verify your identity. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request.

European Economic Area users: If a recipient of your personal data is located outside of the European Economic Area (hereinafter "EEA") in a country that is not recognized by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of data protection, we will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data remains protected and secure when it is transferred outside of your home country, in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. For the EEA, these safeguards include data transfer agreements implementing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (a form of data transfer agreement pre-approved by the European Commission as providing adequate safeguards for personal data). You may ask for a copy of such appropriate measures by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Policy.
CHILDREN
Our Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect or sell any information from individuals younger than 16 without parental consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.
DATA SECURITY
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to only those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need for such access.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
DATA RETENTION
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out above, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. 
Some of the main criteria we use to determine specific retention periods include recording keeping obligations under applicable law or industry standards, relevance to potential litigation, and whether data is necessary for us to exercise our rights or maintain the Services. For more information on data retention periods, please contact us by using the information below.
YOUR DUTY AND RIGHTS IN RELATION TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Your duty to inform us of changes
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and up to date. If you become aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that the information may be updated or corrected.
Your rights in connection with personal data
You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to the following rights:
Right to be informed.
This right allows you to know what personal data we collect about you, why we collect it, who collects it, how long it will be stored, and who we share it with, amongst other things. Through this Privacy Policy, we are informing you of this processed information.
Right of access to your personal data.
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Right to correct or rectify your personal data.
This right gives you the right to ask us to correct anything that you think is wrong with the personal data we have about you and to complete any incomplete personal data.
Right to deletion of your personal data.
This is called the right to erasure, the right to deletion, or the "right to be forgotten." This right means you can ask for your personal data to be deleted. Sometimes we can delete your information, but other times it is not possible for either technical or legal reasons. If that is the case, we will consider if we can limit the ways we use it. We will also inform you of our reason for denying your deletion request.
Right to restrict processing of your personal data.
This is the right to ask us to only use or store your personal data for certain purposes. You have this right in certain instances, such as where you believe the data is inaccurate or the processing activity is unlawful.
Right to data portability.
This is the right to request we move or transfer your personal data, in a machine-readable form. It is the right to ask for and receive a portable copy of your personal data that you have given us so that you can move it, copy it, keep it for yourself and/or transfer it to another organization.
Right to object to the processing of your personal data by us.
This is your right to tell us to stop using your personal data. You have this right when you rely on a legitimate interest of ours (or of a third party). You may also object at any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. We will stop processing the relevant personal data unless: (i) we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, or freedoms; or (ii) we need to continue processing your personal data to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.
Right to withdraw your consent.
In case that the processing of your personal data is based on the legal basis of consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing before you withdrew your consent. It will also not affect processing performed on other lawful grounds.
If you wish to make a complaint about how we process your personal data, please contact us and we will endeavor to handle your request as soon as possible. You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your information is unlawful. If you are in the EU, you can find the supervisory authority for your country and how to contact them in
https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en
. If you are in the UK, the supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner's Office, whom you can contact in
https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/your-personal-information-concerns
.
How you can exercise your rights:
To exercise any of your rights, please contact us by using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy. When submitting a privacy request, please describe your relationship with us and provide sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to you.
We may need to request specific personal data from you to help us verify your identity. This is another appropriate security measure to ensure, for example, that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
If you wish to submit a request on behalf of another person, please provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are authorized by that person to make the request on their behalf.
How we will respond to your request:
We will confirm the receipt of your request within 10 business days, and, in that communication, we will also describe our identity verification process (if needed) and when you should expect a response unless we have already granted or denied the request.
Please allow us up to a month for us to reply to your requests from the day we received your request. If we need more time (up to 90 days in total), we will inform you of the reason and the extension period in writing.
If we cannot satisfy a request, we will explain why in our response to you. For data portability requests, we will choose a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without difficulty.
We will generally not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests. However, we may charge a fee if we determine that your request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. In those cases, we will tell you why we made that determination and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly when we are unable to verify your identity. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request.

If you submit your request through password-protected account, we may verify your identity through the existing authentication practices for your account. We may require you to re-authenticate yourself before deleting, correcting, or disclosing the consumer’s data. If you do not submit your request through password-protected account, we may require you to provide information sufficient to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information and to describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. For example, we may request that you provide us with at least two pieces of personal information that match those that we maintain about you, or three pieces of personal information, depending on the sensitivity of the personal information subject to the request and the risk of harm to the consumer. We will review each request carefully and respond accordingly within the timeframe established by the CCPA/CPRA. You may also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights and choices on your behalf, please provide evidence that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. You may submit your request via email to privacy@wemade.com. We may also require you verify your own identity with us directly. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies and practices, please contact us at privacy@wemade.com.
