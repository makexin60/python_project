General
As we reserve the right to modify provisions of this privacy policy and to update it periodically, we encourage you to review it regularly to stay informed about any alterations.
Personal Data Collection
​
There are several methods through which we may collect your personal data. In this section, we detail the types of personal data we might (but not necessarily do) gather from you. The processing of personal data is contingent upon your role and the specific processing purposes. The data retention period also varies depending on the processing objective.

Additionally, when feasible, we may anonymize your personal data for statistical and analytical purposes. Once personal data is anonymized, it ceases to be identifiable  and is no longer considered personal data.

Third parties that have access to data obtained by our games

We may (but not necessarily do) transmit data to external services:
​
Distributions platform: Our games may utilize the SDK provided by the platform/store from where you are buying the game (Meta, PlayStation Store, Steam, Viveport, etc.) mainly for the purpose of authorization and license validation.

The safeguarding of your personal data is of paramount importance to us.

​
It is important to note that while we take extensive measures to secure your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security during the transmission of personal data over the internet or during storage. We recommend considering this before sharing personal data.
Your Rights
Privacy legislation grants you specific rights regarding your personal data. These rights are not absolute, and we will assess whether we can reasonably fulfill your request. If we cannot do so or if it would compromise the privacy of others, we may refuse your request, and in such cases, we will communicate our reasons. You have the following rights:
​
Right of Access: You have the right to request information about the personal data we process concerning you. A copy of your processed personal data can be requested, with additional copies incurring a reasonable fee.
​
Right to Rectification: If your processed personal data is incorrect or incomplete, you can request adjustments or supplements.
​
Right to Erasure: You can request the deletion of certain (or all) personal data. Deletion depends on the purpose of processing. Data processed due to legal obligations or for agreement performance will only be deleted if no longer necessary for these purposes.
​
For data processed based on legitimate interest, deletion is considered if your privacy rights outweigh our rights or the rights of others. Data processed with consent is deleted upon withdrawal of consent or when required by law. Accidental processing, legal requirements, or the settlement of legal proceedings may also prompt data deletion.
​
Restriction of Processing: If you dispute the accuracy, believe unlawful processing has occurred, data is no longer needed, or you have objected to processing, you can request restriction.
​
Restriction may occur during dispute assessment, objection evaluation, or when no legal ground for further processing exists but you wish to retain the data. If processing is restricted at your request, the data may still be used for legal proceedings or dispute resolution.
​
Right to Data Portability: Upon request, we can transfer automatically processed data related to agreement execution or based on your consent to you or a designated party at reasonable intervals.
