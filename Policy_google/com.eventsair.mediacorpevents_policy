How is my Personal Information Collected?
The main way we collect personal information is through you directly or through your authorised representative. That is, when you visit us at
https://focusnetwork.co
or any of our event websites and submit your personal information or request your personal information to be used (i.e. by subscribing to an email newsletter).
We sometimes collect personal information from a third party or from a publicly available source, but only if:
you have consented to such collection or would reasonably expect us to collect your personal information in this way, or
if it is necessary for a specific purpose such as the investigation of a privacy complaint.
Your personal information may be collected through the following services that are used on our website:
User contact forms
Cookies & Analytics

Social Network widgets and buttons (Pinterest, Twitter etc)
Direct Marketing

We only collect personal information for purposes which are directly related to our functions or activities under the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act), and only when it is necessary for or directly related to such purposes.
How do you use my Personal Information?

you have consented
you would reasonably expect, or have told us, that information of this kind is usually passed to those individuals, bodies or agencies
it is otherwise required or authorised by law
it will prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to somebody’s life or health, or
it is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of public revenue.
Is my Personal Information Stored Securely?
We take steps to protect the personal information we hold against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and against other misuse. When the personal information that we collect is no longer required, we destroy or delete it in a secure manner.
