MediaFire’s Privacy Policy and User Notice
Introduction
We strive to comply with global privacy regulations, including GDPR. If you have any concerns or believe we are not in compliance, please contact us at
privacy@mediafire.com
.
MediaFire recognizes and believes that data privacy is essential to all Internet users, and the privacy of your personal information is of the utmost importance to us. We are committed to providing you an experience that is safe, secure, and trustworthy. Part of this commitment means safeguarding and respecting your privacy and your choices.
This Privacy Notice explains what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it, in addition to information on disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information.
Because we’re a technology company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. This Privacy Policy gives you an overview of all possible situations in which we could interact together. Of course, all situations may not apply to you.
This Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our Terms of Service, collectively referred to as the "Agreement", governs your use of the MediaFire website, Content, apps, software, products, applications, tools and services provided to you on, from, or through the MediaFire website or platform regardless of how your access or use them (collectively, the "Services").  Where we provide the Services under contract with an organization (for example your employer) that organization controls the information processed by the Services. “User”, “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting MediaFire’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.  “We”, “Us”, and “Ourselves” refers to MediaFire. “Party”, “Parties”, or “Us”, refers to both you and ourselves.  It doesn’t matter if the words are capitalized or not.  If you choose not to accept this Policy, please do not access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our business.
All topics are covered in greater detail below.
Overview
We want you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to you, our legal basis, your rights and the choices that are available to you.
This Privacy Policy incorporates:
Better navigation and user-friendly language. To make the policy easier to understand, we use clear, plain language and examples that illustrate our activities.
Insights into how we acquire your information and how it is used.
More control over your information. We provide intelligence on how you can control the information you provide to us. Our policy explains how you can make choices about your information, and the measures we’ve put in place to keep your information secure.
More about using our products for work. Many users have access to our services through their organizations (e.g., their employers), who control their accounts or use of our Services. The updated policy clarifies our relationship to these users and explains the tools available to administrators of these users.
What is Personal and Non Personal Information?
Personally Identifiable Information, commonly referred to as PII, is information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online or device identifier, an identification number, or location data such as your IP address.  In relation to your interaction with MediaFire, personal information, for example, may include information you may purposefully provide such as your name and email address during account registration or your address and financial information if you make a purchase.   By visiting our website, we automatically collect your IP address.  Upon your request and in order for us to download or distribute any Content uploaded by you to MediaFire, your files become published Content. However, any personally identifiable information within those files remains protected under GDPR.
Non-personally identifiable information cannot be used to identify or locate an individual person.  Examples are: hashed/anonymized/pseudonymized data, click stream information, browser type, demographics, time and date, which advertisements are clicked or scrolled over and other data of interest.
We will not share personal information about you or any of your Content with any third parties except as described in this Privacy Notice.
Who We Get Information From and How Your Information Is Used
Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you visit MediaFire.
We use your personal information to fulfill our commitment to you and provide you with our Services.  In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make our Services relevant, interesting and personal to you.  We process your data based on legitimate interests, consent, contract necessity, and compliance with legal obligations, always prioritizing your rights under GDPR.
How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any choices you have made about information you provide.
Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect from and about you.
You give us information yourself voluntarily, when you:
Create and update an account
In order to use certain features, you need to create an account with us. We ask for the bare minimum amount of necessary information - your name and email address, a user ID selected by you, and a, hopefully, complicated and very secure password. Then we assign you a unique identifying number in our database.
We use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to communicate with you.  Communications may be to onboard you to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.  Or, to send you administrative messages and information, notifications about changes to our Services, and updates to our agreements. Additionally, communications could be about Service features, updates, security alerts, technical notices, support and administrative messages, surveys, offers, promotions, events, and provide other news or information which may interest you or other similar messages.
Make a purchase
If you purchase a subscription or add-ons, you must provide certain payment and billing data to our payment processing partners, including your name, credit card information, billing address, and zip code. We do store purchase history, billing, and payment confirmation information.  We’ll email you invoices confirming your purchase
Contact us directly
If you contact us for support or to report a problem or concern (regardless of whether you have created an account), we collect and store your messages, and other data about you like your name, email address, location, operating system, IP address, and any other data you provide or that we collect through automated means (which we cover below). We use this data to respond to you and research your question or concern.
Interact with our ads
Our advertisers gather information when you click on or tap ads or watch videos.
The information is used to show you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you and to tailor advertisements across your various devices.  Studying ad results helps us make decisions about our customers advertising preferences.
Add names and email addresses to share folders and files
To use these features, you provide names and email addresses in order to enable the functionality of the features.
Add people or designate an administrator or billing representative for a business account
Companies purchase seats on their account for employees or business associates and provide names and email addresses for the person ‘occupying’ each seat purchased.  By necessity, each business account will need to provide contact information for their account administrator and, if different, a billing representative.  If you are an individual registered user and the domain of the primary email address associated with your account is owned by your employer and was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and your organization wishes to establish a business account, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator or group of users.
Share your information from other companies, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google
You may allow transmission of your personal information from companies like these, which may be controlled in the settings of each website, not by MediaFire.   MediaFire does not ask for information about you.
Provide information at an event we sponsor or participate in
Your name, contact, and possibly other information, may be recorded on our servers.
Your administrator integrates our Services with other services you use
To do this, you will need an account.
File a DMCA claim with us
When you file a DMCA claim, you provide information about who you are. All the info will be kept on our servers.
Accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
You must accept our agreements in order to use our Services and we record your clicked acceptance.
Apply for a job
When a person applies for a job with MediaFire thru our website, all information is recorded and maintained on our servers.   Applications received in person or by mail will be manually processed and your name and contact information will be entered into forms stored on our servers.
Our systems and/or third parties may automatically obtain information:
Third-party platforms you connect with
An example would be logging into MediaFire from Facebook.   We need to ensure it’s you, so information is passed to us.  You should review the privacy policies of every website you visit.  Third-party platforms may use cookies to track users and gather information. You should review the privacy policies of these platforms to understand their practices.
Information about your device(s)
Information about your IP address, device make, model, operating system, version, and data connection type, and platform, in addition to other specifications and information will be automatically gleaned during contact with our Services.
We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to provide updates and other relevant messages related to our Services. These may include information and in-app messages about, new services, new features, etc.
Devices are discussed in more detail below.
When you upload, download, collaborate, share files or otherwise interact with our Services
These actions also are subject to the next point below – ‘When you interact with our website or mobile app or API’.
You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission for others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your company administrator (if applicable) select.  Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.   Under certain circumstances, when you share a file, your display name and profile picture may be displayed on that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.  You can confirm whether certain information is visible from within the Services by contacting us or your administrator (if applicable).  Please be aware that any Content posted, including information about you, by you or anyone with access to the Content, that Content may be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in search results of search engines.
When you interact with our website or mobile app or API
MediaFire is always looking for ways to make our Services smarter and faster, and more innovative and useful to you.  We use collective learnings about how people use our Services so we may identify areas for integration and improvement, and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot our Services.
To that end, when you interact with us, or really any technology service today, information is gathered to help us fulfill our commitments to you to provide and protect our Services and you.  To do that, we need:
Information about your behavior on MediaFire:
including, login details, date/time of visits, page view data, URL of the Web page you visited before navigating to us, referring/exit pages, click data, features you use, types of advertisements you interact with, duration of your visit, the sizes and names of the files or folders you upload, download, share or access.
We use this information to personalize and improve our Services, by analyzing who we appeal to, activity patterns and trends, develop new products and services, and test and analyze new features by providing features to some users before rolling the feature out to all users. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature, we can understand which version is better.
Information about your devices
plus your browser information, browser history, IP address, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use, your geolocation and system configuration information is recorded.
This information can help us identify unique users across multiple devices so we can monitor and analyze traffic and trends and track usage and activities in connection with our Services.  We use general location information to provide country based advertising (e.g. US-based advertising, if you are in the US).  We also perform studies necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our site and mobile applications, monitor and improve the information security, and to facilitate the Services’ technical functioning, including troubleshooting and resolving issues.
Information may be used as required or permitted by law, or as we, in our sole discretion, otherwise determine to be necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our users, employees, third parties, the public, or our Services.
Other companies give us data:
We may collect info from third party services we contract with
We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing and fraud detection, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.  We select only well-established and trusted service partners to access information about you to perform services on our behalf.
Information related to your use of third-party services
The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
Have you ever searched for information on a mailbox and then when you visit other websites you see ads for mailboxes?  We contract with advertising companies that will use your previous search history and clicks to provide advertising of specific interest to you.  Your interests and interactions with ads are not stored on our servers, but we do benefit from this practice.   After all, ads help support our website and the experience should be of interest to you.
When you engage in an online survey initiated by us
From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third-party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve our users, as a whole, by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications and/or promotional activities, and innovations in products and other service offerings we might contemplate.
From a social media website
We allow you to use social media sites to create your MediaFire account, sign in to us, or to connect your account with the social media site.  Social media sites may give us automatic access to certain personal information retained by them about you (e.g., content viewed by you, content liked by you, and information about the advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on, etc.).
To sign in from a social media website, such as Facebook or Twitter, information is shared between us to authenticate your identity.  Those platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you or the platform or service decide to give us.  The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are.
If you click on a link provided via a social media plugin, you are voluntarily establishing a connection with that respective social media site.  Services, like Facebook, give you the option to post information from your account with them.  The social media features on our website, like the Facebook Like Button, may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things, such as, your IP address and which page of our Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature (e.g. Like Button). Your interactions with these features are governed by the social media’s own privacy policy.
You should be aware that any information you provide on social media websites, community forums and publicly accessible blogs, including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information, may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.  Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.
Device Information
We automatically receive certain types of information when you install, access, update, or use our Services. This information includes your computer, tablet, mobile or other digital device's unique identifier, manufacturer and model, operating system and version, screen size and resolution,  mobile network  and status (WiFi, etc.), application version including installation and updates info, settings, and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. The type and amount of information collected may vary depending on the device and its settings, such as whether you are using a Mac, PC, iPhone, or Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
We use this information to determine what types and version of devices, etc. are accessing our Services.  After all, we have to write software to accommodate various platforms, versions, etc.   We have to keep up and necessarily sunset unused code.
This Privacy Policy governs your use of the MediaFire Services, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage and disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.  Information may be collected from you in various ways when you use our Services.  We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Web pages, apps, services and communications.  This information includes your computer, tablet, mobile or other digital device's IP address, access times, your browser type and language. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and accessed pages.  Personal and non-personally identifiable information from collected data may be shared with third parties who work on our behalf to provide your services.  These third-party services and unique identifiers may be used to contact you, measure usage and analyze trends, administer the website and collect information for its databases. For example:

Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies
What are they?
When you interact with people, it’s nice when they remember you, your relationship and what you like.  That ‘feel good’ experience has been extended to your interactions with websites.
Like most browsers and websites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files saved on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our site, Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.
MediaFire and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons when you access and use our Services. These tools are essential to enable the Services to provide the features you have requested, such as remembering you have logged in. These tools also automatically track and collect certain system data and usage data when you use our Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through these tools to other data that we collect.
These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device.  The specific names and types of cookies, web beacons, unique identifiers, and similar technologies used to collect and manage information may change from time to time. In order to help you better understand our use of such technologies, we have provided the some terminology and definitions.
Cookies
are mutually beneficial small text files, which often include a unique identifier, placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. They are commonly used to remember where you were during your session with a website.  They can be used to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites.  Cookies allow us to recognize you, remember things about your visits, make our site easier to use, see which areas and features are popular and count visits to our website.  Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. There are several types of cookies:
Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow sites to link your actions during that particular browser session.  They help with navigation on a website and are enabled by default.
Persistent cookies are stored on your device and record information, allowing sites to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites. They remain until you manually delete them or until they expire.
First-party cookies are created by the website you are visiting and are necessary to keep track of your personal preferences and the current session.  Most web browsers enable first-party cookies by default. If you were to disable first-party cookies, a website could not keep track of your activity as you move from page to page.
Third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting.  These are commonly used for advertising, analytics, etc.
Flash cookies aka Local Shared Objects (“LSO”) are a small file stored on your computer by a website that uses Adobe’s Flash player technology.  Information stored on a Flash cookie is available to all browsers and is considered a security issue.  When you delete or clear cookies from your browser, you will not necessarily delete the Flash cookies stored on your computer.  MediaFire does not use Flash cookies.
Web beacons
are small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify users and user behavior.  There are myriad ways in which they can be used.  For example, a third-party tracking site can determine how much merchandise was purchased for a particular banner ad campaign. In scenarios such as these, the individual users may still remain anonymous, even though their buying habits are disclosed.
Mobile device identifiers
- When you access mobile applications, companies don’t have access to traditional browser cookies to track you over time. Instead, third party advertising and analytics companies use device identifiers, such as Apple iOS’s Identifiers for Advertisers and Google Android’s Advertising ID, to monitor the different applications used on a particular device.
Device fingerprinting
can track devices over time, based on your browser’s 
configurations and settings. Because each browser is unique, device fingerprinting can identify your device, without using cookies. Since device fingerprinting uses the characteristics of your browser configuration to track you, deleting cookies won’t help. Device fingerprinting technologies are evolving and can be used to track you on all kinds of internet-connected devices that have browsers, such as smart phones, tablets, laptop and desktop computers.
HTML5
has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd want to do online without requiring additional software such as browser plugins. It does everything from animation to apps, music to movies, and can also be used to build incredibly complicated applications that run in your browser.  And, it can generally be used as an alternative to Adobe Flash.  It isn't proprietary and it is cross-platform, which means it doesn't care whether you're using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or ultrabook or a Smart TV.  If your browser supports HTML5, it should work flawlessly.
Why does MediaFire use these technologies?
MediaFire and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience, increased functionality and to recognize you across different services and devices.
We use these cookies both when you visit our site and Services via a browser and our mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.
Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. They are either necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant and targeted ads. We use cookies and similar technologies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent). You are free to block, delete, or disable these technologies through your device settings. However, disabling them may affect the functionality of certain features of our Services. You can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup

, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators

domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY
This California Privacy Policy (CCPA) is an addition to our
Privacy Policy
. While our Privacy Policy complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, this section specifically addresses the rights and protections for California residents under the CCPA.
We collect the minimum necessary amount of information.  We don’t buy or sell lists of information.  We don’t unnecessarily share your personal information.
What we collect, how we use the information, how others may obtain your personal information and how you can limit personal information collection is detailed in our
Privacy Policy
.  Some basic information, such as IP address, is collected automatically to help us provide the services you expect from MediaFire and to determine your geolocation.  And, some info you voluntarily give us, like when you sign up for an account.  How long we keep your data on MediaFire is detailed in our
Data Retention Policy
.   You can delete the account you created at any time.
To provide the services you request and comply with legal requirements, it may be necessary to share certain aspects of your data with third-party service providers. For example, credit card information is shared with payment processors to complete transactions. For example, if you make a purchase, we have to provide your credit card information to the credit card processors for your purchase to be approved by your credit card company.  CCPA does recognize that transferring personal information to a service provider under the law is not a sale.
If you do not restrict ads or purchase an ad-free account, advertisers may collect your IP address to determine your location and display relevant ads. If you opt-out, we will place a cookie on your computer to prevent the sharing of your information with advertisers. Please note that if you clear your cookies, you will need to opt-out again.
MediaFire uses information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We may disclose information in response to legal processes or enforceable government requests, including requests from law enforcement agencies.
Your Privacy Rights
If you are a resident of California, under the CCPA, you have the following rights:
Right to Know: Up to twice every 12 months, you have the right to request that we disclose the personal information we collect, use, or disclose about you, as well as information about our data practices.
Please refer to our
See our
Privacy Policy
for detailed information.
Right to Request Deletion: You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information that we have collected from youa;
You can delete your account yourself, or we can help you
Right to Non-Discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
Right to Opt-Out of Selling:  We do not sell personal information.  However, to the extent sharing your personal information is considered a “sale” under the CCPA, as a California resident you have the right to Opt-out of sharing.
For assistance or to exercise any of your privacy rights, you can contact customer support via our

form or email us at
privacy@mediafire.com
