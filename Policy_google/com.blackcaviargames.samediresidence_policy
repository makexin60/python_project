In
-game advertising (i.e. when you view
ads in Our Games)
To

ads,
we
ma
y
s
end

advertisers
(or ad
networks) to
enable them
to find
appropriate
ads
to
serve
to y

games
and on third-party
properti
es. You ca
n control and limit our use of y
our advertising ID in your
device settings. We do
not
control which specific
ads are shown
in our
games (it
is controlled
by ad networks), but we do blacklist certain categories of ads.
Advertising

are
used
by
th
e
ad
networks
for
a
number
of
pu
rposes
(please
refer
to
th
e
Privacy Notices of our advertising partners listed here) including:
●
limit the number of times you see the same ad;
●
ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not ‘automated’ bots;
●
serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you ba
sed on
y
our advertising
ID engagement with other brands and ads, also recorded using your advertising I
D
and using your general geographic area. Other brands buy a
dvertisement pl
acement
via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in Our Games. The ad
network or ad exchange acts as intermediary between the othe
r game companies and
Us. In order for an ad network to charge the company
bu
y
in
g the ad, c
licks
from the
ad and potentially
installs of other developers’ applications party apps are tracked.
Views, clicks, and installs from ads are measured using Advertiser ID;
●
keep track what games you have used to market you similar kind of games. I
P
-address
is typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are
coming from for example country, state
,
and sometimes at city
level).
