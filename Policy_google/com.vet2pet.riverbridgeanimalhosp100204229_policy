FINANCIAL INFORMATION. If your Provider enables a feature in the Application that allows you to submit a credit application or credit card payment directly to a financial institution or payment processor (collectively, a “Third Party Vendor”), and you take advantage of this feature, you are connected directly to the Third Party Vendor to supply the requested financial and other personal information.
