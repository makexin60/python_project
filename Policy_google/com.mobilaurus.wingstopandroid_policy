Whether you have an account or other business relationship with us -- if so, we generally keep your personal information for as long as you have an account or business relationship with us so that we can continue to provide our Services to you;
Whether we are subject to any legal obligations to retain your personal information (e.g., any laws that require us to keep transaction records for a certain period of time before we can delete them); and
Whether we need to retain your personal information to defend our legal interests or exercise our legal rights, such as in the context of a legal proceeding.

OVERVIEW
We’re not in the wing business. We’re in the flavor business. It’s been our mission to serve the world flavor since we first opened shop in ’94, and we’re just getting started.
1997 saw the opening of our first franchised Wingstop location, and by 2002 we had served the world one billion wings. It’s flavor that defines us and has made Wingstop one of the fastest growing brands in the restaurant industry.
Wingstop is the destination for made-to-crave wings and flavorful chicken sandwich, hand-cut seasoned fries and any of our famous sides. For people who demand flavor in everything they do, there’s only Wingstop – because it’s more than a meal, it’s a flavor experience.

OVERVIEW
We’re not in the wing business. We’re in the flavor business. It’s been our mission to serve the world flavor since we first opened shop in ’94, and we’re just getting started.
1997 saw the opening of our first franchised Wingstop location, and by 2002 we had served the world one billion wings. It’s flavor that defines us and has made Wingstop one of the fastest growing brands in the restaurant industry.
Wingstop is the destination for made-to-crave wings and flavorful chicken sandwich, hand-cut seasoned fries and any of our famous sides. For people who demand flavor in everything they do, there’s only Wingstop – because it’s more than a meal, it’s a flavor experience.
