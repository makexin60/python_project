For the purposes of the European Union Data Protection Act 1998, Direct Satellite TV Limited is a ‘data controller’, i.e., the company responsible for and controlling the processing of your personal information.
Information That We Collect
TeeVeeing employs controller apps, specialised satellite hardware, and software that require data collection to enhance your experience. We utilise technologies like cookies, pixel tags, and server logs, which collect data whenever your device interacts with our servers. This information includes your device types, locations, and viewing habits, helping us improve and tailor our services. Accepting our terms allows us to track website usage. We commit to protecting your privacy and only share your data as per our policies or legal requirements.
Data Collection and Usage
When you sign up for a TeeVeeing membership, you provide personal details like your name, address, email, usernames, and passwords for family members. This information may also come from referrals, feedback, surveys, or contests. We use this data to manage your membership, enhance service performance, personalise your experience with features like favourites and recordings, communicate updates, and ensure the security of our services by preventing fraud and technical issues.
Sharing your personal data
We use survey data to create user profiles and may share your personal data under specific conditions: accessing restricted areas, receiving requested information by post, or receiving a paid service. We only share data with partner companies to provide services outlined in our Terms of Service. We will always seek your consent before using your information for purposes not mentioned in this Privacy Policy.
Cookies and similar technologies
We use cookies to collect information about how you interact with our services. Third-party cookies, like Google Analytics, are also used but are not under our direct control. These cookies help recognise your browser and/or devices, remember your settings, analyse usage patterns, and store session data to improve your experience. On our website, you can decline cookies via your browser settings, which may impact our services’ functionality. By accepting our cookies notification, you agree to our use of information collected through cookies.
What choices do I have?
We are committed to giving you control over your privacy. You can manage, review, and update your privacy settings through our preferences centre, where you can opt out of communications such as newsletters.
Copy of the information we hold
You have the right to request an electronic copy of all personal information we hold about you. If you prefer a printed copy, please send us a cheque for £25 to cover the costs. Ensure your request is in writing and includes proof of your identity and address, such as a driver’s license or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill. You will receive your copy within 30 days of the request.
Correcting or changing your information
You can request corrections to inaccuracies in your data at no cost. Simply send us a written request with your membership username and registration details, specifying what information is incorrect and what it should be corrected to.
Deleting your membership and information
If you decide to end your TeeVeeing membership, you can request the deletion of your account and all associated data. However, we must retain certain information for specific periods due to legal, regulatory, or business requirements, such as financial record-keeping. Our systems and backups are designed to securely manage your data, and while immediate removal might be delayed, any restored data from backups will be deleted if previously requested.
How secure is my information?
We implement strong technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data. Your account is secured with a unique username and password, and we store your data on secure servers. Payment details are not stored and are encrypted when transmitted for processing.
Transfers of data
We adhere to stringent data protection measures globally, consistent with the protections outlined in our policy. Our operations are based in Spain, and by using TeeVeeing, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We do not transfer your personal data outside the EU unless to a recognised ‘safe harbour’ or under strict contractual terms that ensure your data’s protection in other territories.
European requirements
Under GDPR, we provide controls and processes to manage and protect your data rights, including access, updating, and deletion. We process your information based on consent for personalised services and to pursue legitimate interests such as improving services, developing new features, customising user experiences, marketing, and ensuring security. These practices balance your privacy with our service needs and obligations to partners.
Providing our services
We process your information as part of the contract you agree to by using our services. For instance, we handle payment information when you purchase a TeeVeeing membership. Additionally, we must process certain data to comply with legal obligations, such as responding to government requests.
Changes
We may update our Privacy Policy periodically but will not reduce your rights without your explicit consent. We will notify you in clear language whenever changes are made and obtain your consent before using your information for new purposes not already covered by this Privacy Policy.
