15. Your Rights
EU/EEA Data Subjects Only
In this Section, we have summarized the rights that EU/EEA data subjects
        have under applicable data protection law, including the GDPR. Some of the
        rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our
        summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from
        the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
Your principal rights under data protection law are:
The right to access;
The right to rectification;
The right to erasure;
The right to restrict processing;
The right to object to processing;
The right to data portability;
The right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
The right to withdraw consent under certain circumstances.
You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your
        personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with
        certain additional information. That additional information includes
        details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data
        concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and
        freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your
        personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but
        additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified
        and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any
        incomplete personal data about you completed.
In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal
        data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data
        are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were
        collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based
        processing where no other legitimate basis for retention exists; you object
        to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law;
        the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have
        been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to
        erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for
        exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for
        compliance with a legal obligation (including contractual obligations); or
        for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
In some circumstances you may have the right to restrict the processing of
        your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of
        the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no
        longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you
        require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
        claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of
        that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may
        continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise
        process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense
        of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or
        legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on
        grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that
        the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for:
        the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
        exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the
        legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an
        objection, we will cease to process the personal data unless we can
        demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override
        your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the
        establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for
        direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing
        purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your
        personal data for this purpose.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for
        scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on
        grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is
        necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
        interest.
If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes data
        protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a
        supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the
        EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place
        of the alleged infringement.
To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data
        is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
        Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the
        withdrawal.
If you do not wish to receive emails about special offers and other
        promotions from us, click the unsubscribe link located in our emails.
You may exercise the same rights as individuals from California (United
        States) pursuant to Section 19 below by using the contact information
        instructions set forth in Section 19, or below in this Section.
If you do not wish to receive other marketing materials from us and/or if
        you do not want us to share your personal data with other entities as
        stated in this Privacy Policy, please provide us with your exact name and
        address and advise us that you wish to opt-out for information sharing or

        de-identified and aggregate data including your personal data may still be
        shared, but it will not be identified or identifiable to you. Please direct

This Section sets out our data retention policies and procedures, which are
        designed to help ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in
        relation to the retention and deletion of personal data.
Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept
        for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods
        for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we will
        determine the period of retention based upon the performance of our
        Services, and any applicable industry and governmental standards.
We may also retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for
        compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to
        protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural
        person.

Microsoft Edge
Windows 10
The new Microsoft Edge
helps you browse, search, shop online, and more. Like all modern browsers, Microsoft Edge lets you collect and store specific data on your device, like cookies, and lets you send information to us, like browsing history, to make the experience as rich, fast, and personal as possible.
Whenever we collect data, we want to make sure it’s the right choice for you. Some people worry about their web browsing history being collected. That’s why we tell you what data is stored on your device or collected by us. We give you choices to control what data gets collected. For more information about privacy in Microsoft Edge, we recommend reviewing our
Privacy Statement
.
What data is collected or stored, and why
Microsoft uses diagnostic data to improve our products and services. We use this data to better understand how our products are performing and where improvements need to be made.
Microsoft Edge collects a set of required diagnostic data to keep Microsoft Edge secure, up to date and performing as expected. Microsoft believes in and practices information collection minimization. We strive to gather only the info we need, and to store it only for as long as it’s needed to provide a service or for analysis. In addition, you can control whether optional diagnostic data associated with your device is shared with Microsoft to solve product issues and help improve Microsoft products and services.
As you use features and services in Microsoft Edge, diagnostic data about how you use those features is sent to Microsoft. Microsoft Edge saves your browsing history—information about websites you visit—on your device. Depending on your settings, this browsing history is sent to Microsoft, which helps us find and fix problems and improve our products and services for all users. You can manage the collection of optional diagnostic data in the browser by selecting

and turning on or off
Help improve Microsoft products by sending optional diagnostic data about how you use the browser, websites you visit, and crash reports
. This includes data from testing new experiences. To finish making changes to this setting, restart Microsoft Edge.
Turning this setting on allows this optional diagnostic data to be shared with Microsoft from other applications using Microsoft Edge, such as a video streaming app that hosts the Microsoft Edge web platform to stream the video. The Microsoft Edge web platform will send info about how you use the web platform and sites you visit in the application to Microsoft.  This data collection is determined by your optional diagnostic data setting in Privacy, search, and services settings in Microsoft Edge.
On Windows 10, these settings are determined by your Windows diagnostic setting. To change your diagnostic data setting, select
Start

As of
March 6th 2024,
Microsoft Edge diagnostic data is collected separately from Windows diagnostic data on Windows 10 (version 22H2 and newer) and Windows 11 (version 23H2 and newer) devices in the European Economic Area. For these Windows versions, and on all other platforms, you can change your settings in Microsoft Edge by selecting

Address bar and search
, and turn on
Show me search and site suggestions using my typed characters
. As you start to type, the info you enter in the address bar is sent to your default search provider to give you immediate search and website suggestions.
When you use InPrivate browsing or guest mode, Microsoft Edge collects some info about how you use the browser depending on your Windows diagnostic data setting or Microsoft Edge privacy settings, but automatic suggestions are turned off and info about websites you visit is not collected. Microsoft Edge will delete your browsing history, cookies, and site data, as well as passwords, addresses, and form data when you close all InPrivate windows. You can start a new InPrivate session by selecting
Settings and more
on a computer or
Tabs
on a mobile device.
Microsoft Edge also has features to help you and your content stay safe online. Windows Defender SmartScreen automatically blocks websites and content downloads that are reported to be malicious. Windows Defender SmartScreen checks the address of the webpage you're visiting against a list of webpage addresses stored on your device that Microsoft believes to be legitimate. Addresses that aren't on your device’s list and the addresses of files you're downloading will be sent to Microsoft and checked against a frequently updated list of webpages and downloads that have been reported to Microsoft as unsafe or suspicious.
To speed up tedious tasks like filling out forms and entering passwords, Microsoft Edge can save info to help. If you choose to use those features, Microsoft Edge stores the info on your device. If you’ve turned on sync for form fill like addresses or passwords, this info will be sent to the Microsoft cloud and stored with your Microsoft account to be synced across all your signed-in versions of Microsoft Edge. You can manage this data from

To integrate your browsing experience with other activities you do on your device, Microsoft Edge shares your browsing history with Microsoft Windows through its Indexer. This information is stored locally on the device. It includes URLs, a category in which the URL might be relevant, such as “most visited”, “recently visited”, or “recently closed”, and also a relative frequency or recency within each category. Websites you visit while in InPrivate mode will not be shared. This information is then available to other applications on the device, such as the start menu or taskbar.

To protect some video and music content from being copied, some streaming websites store Digital Rights Management (DRM) data on your device, including a unique identifier (ID) and media licenses. When you go to one of these websites, it retrieves the DRM info to make sure you have permission to use the content.
Microsoft Edge also stores cookies, small files that are put on your device as you browse the web. Many websites use cookies to store info about your preferences and settings, like saving the items in your shopping cart so you don't have to add them each time you visit. Some websites also use cookies to collect info about your online activity to show you interest-based advertising. Microsoft Edge gives you options to clear cookies and block websites from saving cookies in the future.
Microsoft Edge will send Do Not Track requests to websites when the
Send Do Not Track requests
setting is turned on. Websites may still track your activities even when a Do Not Track request is sent, however.
