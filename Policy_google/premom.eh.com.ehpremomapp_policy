In-App Community and Group Chat
When you share and communicate using our community features in the App, including Group Chat, you select the audience for the post. For in-App Community, if you select the “Public” option for your audience, anyone who has joined the App community platform can also view it.  This includes your username and any content you share as a post, comment, or question within the App community. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared, or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and by other services that integrate with our Services.
For in-App Group Chat, your username and any content you post or share within the Group Chat chatroom will be visible to anyone who has been invited to the chatroom.  We do not use the content shared in Group Chat chatrooms for any purpose other than to facilitate the functionality of the chatrooms.
With your consent, we may use and publicly display the pregnancy story or content you choose to share and post on the App community platform for educational, marketing and public relations purposes.
You should carefully consider what you choose to share on the App community platform and Group Chat because people who can see your activity on our Services can choose to share it with others on and off our Services platform, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Services, in person or in virtual reality experiences. Also, when you comment on someone else’s post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person’s content.
Other users can also use our Services to create and share content about you with the community. For example, other users can mention you in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you in our Services, you can report the content to our administrators by contacting us at support@premom.com.

Cookies, Software Development Kits, and Other Technologies

Some of these technologies that we use are “strictly necessary” or “required” for the Services to function. We also use analytics tools, such as to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. Such analytics tools may provide data, such as information about your engagement with the Services which may be used to provide content, analysis or functionality or to measure and analyze engagement with the Services.
Your Choices.
Most browsers and devices are configured to accept cookies and similar tracking technologies automatically. You may be able to set your browser and device options so to limit such technologies. Choices are typically device and browser specific. Please see https://allaboutcookies.org/how-to-manage-cookies for additional information.
Retention of Your Personal Information
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.
If you choose to delete the App from your device (note that deletion of the App does not mean that your account is deleted – please contact us at support@premom.com if you wish to delete your account) or your account becomes inactive, we will retain your Personal Information for a period of five (5) years in case you decide to re-activate the Services or re-install the App. We have determined that this retention period is appropriate taking into account the factors described above and based on our experience with our App users, in order to secure your smooth experience with our App functions.
You may delete your account and erase your Personal Information at any time by contacting us at support@premom.com. Please note that if you choose to do this, your Personal Information will not be recoverable should you later create another account.
Please note that, in all cases, we may need to retain Personal Information for a longer period where we are subject to legal or regulatory requirements to do so.
Information Security
We believe that the largest threat to security and privacy is that someone could get your device and account information. You can help keep your Personal Information secure by properly selecting and protecting passwords, not sharing passwords with others, and preventing others from using your mobile device, laptop or other devices that can access the Services.
Links
Although the Services may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on those websites or services. The information practices of those websites or services are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

Access the Personal Data we have about you.

Restrict the processing of your Personal Data
Have your Personal Data deleted (i.e., the “right to be forgotten”)

There may be situations where we are not required to comply with your request and we will let you know if one of those situations arises.

Data Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.
If you choose to delete the App from your device (note that deletion of the App does not mean that your account is deleted – please contact us at
support@premom.com
if you wish to delete your account) or your account becomes inactive, we will retain your Personal Information for a period of five (5) years in case you decide to re-activate the Services or re-install the App. We have determined that this retention period is appropriate taking into account the factors described above and based on our experience with our App users, in order to secure your smooth experience with our App functions.
You may delete your account and erase your personal information at any time by contacting us at
support@premom.com
. Please note that if you choose to do this, your personal information will not be recoverable should you later create another account.

If you provide us with new personal information that we do not already have about you, we will use it solely for the purpose of verifying your request. We will let you know via email if we need more information from you to verify your request. Please reply to our requests promptly.
We will communicate with you about your requests via email.
We will use the email address you provided when submitting your request.
If we cannot verify your identity, we will let you know.

If we require additional time beyond the initial 45 days after we receive your request, we will let you know within the first 45 days.
We do not ordinarily charge a fee for our response to your requests.
However, we may do so to the extent your request(s) are excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that charging a fee is warranted, we will let you know and will provide you with an estimate of the associated costs of responding to your request(s).
If we determine that we cannot or will not take the action that you requested, we will let you know.
We will inform you of our reasons for not taking action and any rights you may have to appeal the decision.
