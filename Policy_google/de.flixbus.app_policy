4. Categories of recipients
Under certain conditions, we transmit your personal data to our subsidiary companies, or personal data from our subsidiary companies is transferred to us, to the extent that is permissible.
As with any major company, we also use external domestic and foreign service providers to handle our business transactions and work with partner companies at home and abroad. These include, for example:
carriers (you can find an overview of the current carriers here)
(IT) service providers
financial institutions and payment service providers
sales partners
customer service providers (internal/external)
shop operators
security companies
(travel) insurers
other partners engaged for our business operations (e.g., auditors, banks, insurance companies, lawyers, supervisory authorities, other parties participating in company acquisitions)
The service providers and partner companies must provide guarantees that suitable technical and organizational measures are implemented by them in such a way that the processing meets legal requirements and the rights of the data subjects are safeguarded.
We transmit personal data to public bodies and institutions (e.g., police, public prosecutor’s office, supervisory authorities) if there is a corresponding obligation/authorization.
For processing carried out by us, we specify the categories of the data recipients under Clause 12.
5. Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countries
As part of our business relationships, your personal data may be shared with or disclosed to third parties, who may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e., in third countries.
Insofar as it is necessary, we will inform about the respective particulars of the transfer to third countries in connection with the processing carried out by us.
The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection that is comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be downloaded from:
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.html
).
However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection by reason of a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed.
This is possible, for example, via binding company regulations (referred to as “binding corporate rules”), standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data, certificates and recognized codes of conduct.
Insofar as it is necessary for your booking and the associated providing and processing of transport services, the transmission of personal data required for this to third countries is permitted in accordance with Art. 49 para. 1(b) GDPR.
Please contact our data protection officer if you would like more detailed information on this topic.
6. Storage period and data deletion
The storage period of the personal data collected depends on the purpose for which we process the data. The data will be stored for as long as this is necessary to achieve the intended purpose.
In the case of processing carried out by us, we specify how long the data will be stored by us. If no explicit storage period is specified below, your personal data will be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose or legal basis for the storage no longer applies.
However, storage can take place beyond the specified time in the event of a(n) (imminent) legal dispute with you, or if other legal proceedings are initiated, or if storage is stipulated by statutory provisions to which we as the controller are subject. If the storage period prescribed by statutory provisions expires, the personal data will be blocked or erased unless further storage by us is required and there is a legal basis for this

In principle, there is also no statutory or contractual obligation to provide us with your personal data; however, we may only be able to provide certain offers to a limited extent, or not at all, if you do not provide the data required for this.
9. Statutory duty to transmit certain data
Under certain circumstances, we may be subject to a special statutory or legal obligation to provide personal data to third parties, in particular public bodies.
10. Data security
We use suitable technical and organizational measures to safeguard your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss or destruction, or against unauthorized access by third parties, taking into consideration the latest technology, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, as well as the existing risks of a data breach (including the probability and effect of such an event) for the data subject.

As part of your subscription to the newsletter, we also obtain your consent that we may personalize the content of our newsletter according to your needs and interests.
To register for our newsletter, we use the double opt-in procedure. This means that after you have registered, we will send an email to the email address you provided, asking you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm your registration within 24 hours, your information will be blocked and automatically erased after one month.

This is lawful under Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to prevent being victim to fraud and suffering financial losses.
In individual cases, a decision about cancellation may occur after booking based on automated decision. The logic for this is based on a set of internal algorithms that processes relevant data points and provides us with scores on matches to different fraudulent patterns or compare the data points with thresholds and values typical of fraudulent patterns in order to detect fraudulent bookings. If you wish to contest this decision, express your own point of view or obtain the intervention of a human of the part of the controller, please reach out to

The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1(f) GDPR; our legitimate interest is to inform you about our product range and to suggest certain products to you.

If you also register for the newsletter via our registration link, we ask you to consent to the processing of your data (email address, first and last name, place of residence) in order to send you our newsletter by email on a regular basis.
As part of your subscription to the newsletter, we also obtain your consent that we may personalize the content of our newsletter according to your needs and interests.
To register for our newsletter, we use the double opt-in procedure. This means that after you have registered, we will send an email to the email address you provided, asking you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm your registration within 24 hours, your information will be blocked and automatically erased after one month.

This is lawful under Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to prevent being victim to fraud and suffering financial losses.
In individual cases, a decision about cancellation may occur after booking based on automated decision. The logic for this is based on a set of internal algorithms that processes relevant data points and provides us with scores on matches to different fraudulent patterns or compare the data points with thresholds and values typical of fraudulent patterns in order to detect fraudulent bookings. If you wish to contest this decision, express your own point of view or obtain the intervention of a human of the part of the controller, please reach out to

2. Warum verarbeitet Ratepay Ihre Daten?
2.1 Der Onlinehändler stellt Ihnen für Ihre Bestellung eine oder mehrere Ratepay Zahlungsarten zur Verfügung. Dabei arbeitet der Onlinehändler mit Ratepay zusammen.
2.2 Kaufpreisansprüche, die aus dem Vertrag zwischen Ihnen und dem Onlinehändler entstehen, werden in weiterer Folge an Ratepay abgetreten, wenn eine Ratepay Zahlungsart genutzt wird (Factoring).
2.3 Das Anbieten verschiedener Ratepay Zahlungsarten erfordert die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten. Nähere Informationen dazu finden Sie in den folgenden Datenschutzbestimmungen.
3. Welche Daten werden verarbeitet?
3.1 Zu vorgenannten Zwecken erhebt und verarbeitet Ratepay folgende Daten über Sie:
3.1.1 Persönliche Daten: Vor- und Nachname, Geburtsdatum, Anschrift, E-Mail-Adresse und Telefonnummer.
3.1.2 Kontodaten (bei Lastschriften): Kontoinhaber, IBAN, BIC/SWIFT, Kreditinstitut.
3.1.3 Bestelldaten: Daten zu Ihren derzeitigen, früheren und/oder zukünftigen Bestellungen beim Onlinehändler oder dem Marktplatz sowie anderen Onlineshops oder Marktplätzen, mit denen Ratepay zusammenarbeitet, wie z.B. Shop-Kundennummer, Angaben zu den Produkten und von Ihnen ausgewählte Ratepay Zahlungsarten.
3.1.4 Bonitätsdaten: Daten, insbesondere von Auskunfteien und anderen Kooperationspartnern, die Auskunft über Ihre Bonität geben, wie z.B. Angaben zu vollstreckbaren Forderungen gegen Sie sowie sonstige Bonitätsdaten, stets vorbehaltlich dessen, dass die Nutzung dieser Daten datenschutzrechtlich zulässig ist.
3.1.5 Sanktions- und PEP-Listen: Abgleich Ihrer Angaben mit Listen von sanktionierten und politisch exponierten Personen. Diese Listen enthalten Informationen wie Namen, Geburtsdatum, Geburtsort, Beruf oder Stellung und den Grund für die Aufnahme in die Liste.
3.1.6 Technische Daten: Daten zu Eigenschaften des von Ihnen genutzten Endgeräts, wie z.B. die IP-Adresse, Browserversion, Spracheinstellungen („gerätespezifische Daten“) und Daten zur Nutzung der Websites des Marktplatzes.
3.2 Wir erheben diese Daten vom Onlinehändler hauptsächlich, um Ihre Bestellung bei dem Onlinehändler zu bearbeiten, mit dem Sie einen Vertrag schließen. Ferner erheben wir Daten zur Bonität von Auskunfteien sowie Informationen von Dienstleistern zu Zwecken der Bekämpfung von Betrug.
4. Risikoanalyse bei Ratepay
4.1 Bei unserer Risikoanalyse verarbeiten wir Ihre Daten, um festzustellen, ob Sie in der Lage sein werden, Ihren Zahlungspflichten nachzukommen, und um Sie vor Betrügern zu schützen, die versuchen könnten, Ihre Daten zur Begehung von Straftaten zu verwenden. Dazu bestimmen wir die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer ordnungsgemäßen Bezahlung im Zusammenhang mit Ratepay Zahlungsarten.
4.2 Um diese Risikoanalyse durchführen zu können, übermittelt der Onlinehändler Ihre Daten an Ratepay. Je nach dem Ergebnis der Risikoanalyse können Sie die jeweilige Ratepay Zahlungsart nutzen. Nutzt der Händler das sog. Stammkundenkonzept, werden Daten über Ihre bisherigen Einkäufe von dem Händler an uns übermittelt, um Sie einer reduzierten Risikoanalyse zu unterziehen und damit die Akzeptanz der gewählten Zahlungsart zu erhöhen. Für die Übermittlung und Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten im Rahmen des Stammdatenkonzepts ist der Händler Verantwortlicher. Wir verarbeiten die übermittelten Daten ausschließlich im Auftrag des Händlers.
4.3 Im Falle der Zusammenarbeit mit weiteren Zahlungspartnern übermitteln wir die Ergebnisse dieser Risikoanalysen im Vorfeld der Forderungsabtretung diese Zahlungspartner, sofern wir die betreffende Forderung an diese abgetreten haben. Einzelheiten entnehmen Sie bitte Ihren Zahlungsinformationen.
4.4 Bei der Durchführung der Risikoanalyse bei Ratepay Zahlungsarten ermittelt Ratepay die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer ordnungsgemäßen Bezahlung (das „Analyseergebnis“). Das Analyseergebnis wird auf Grundlage unserer Erfahrung im Bereich Onlinezahlungen sowie der Zahlungsart und einer mathematisch-statistischen Auswertung folgender Daten ermittelt:
4.4.1 Informationen zur aktuellen Bestellung (Preis der Waren oder Dienstleistungen, Angaben zum Käufer oder zur Person, die den Dienst nutzt, Warenkorbebene, technische Daten),
4.4.2 Information zu bereits mittels einer Ratepay Zahlungsart getätigten Bestellungen,
4.4.3 Angaben zu Ihrer Anschrift,
4.4.4 Information von Auskunfteien, sogenannte „credit scores“ (z.B. Schufa), sowie Bonitätsinformationen. Bei der Verwendung einer Ratepay Zahlungsart werden Bonitätsdaten für einen Zeitraum von 12 Monaten in unseren Produktivsystemen gespeichert und zur Risikoprüfung herangezogen. Von Auskunfteien übermittelte negative Merkmale werden demgegenüber maximal für 48 Stunden in unseren Produktivsystemen genutzt. Die weitere Nutzung der Daten in den Produktivsystemen dient dazu, Mehrfachabfragen bei Auskunfteien zu vermeiden.
4.5 Auf Grundlage des Analyseergebnisses trifft der Onlinehändler die Entscheidung, ob Ihnen die gewünschte Ratepay Zahlungsart angeboten werden kann. Dazu übermittelt Ratepay dem Onlinehändler die Information, ob das Ergebnis der Risikoanalyse positiv oder negativ ausgefallen ist. Außerdem übermittelt Ratepay dem Onlinehändler in bestimmten Fällen auch den Grund für ein negatives Analyseergebnis (z.B. eine fehlerhafte Adresseingabe oder unzureichende Bonität). Diese Übermittlung ermöglicht es dem Onlinehändler unnötige Ablehnungen hinsichtlich der gewählten Ratepay Zahlungsart zu vermeiden, etwa indem er seine Kunden auf Fehler bei der Eingabe der Versandadresse hinweist. Der Onlinehändler hat zu keinem Zeitpunkt Zugriff auf die Daten, auf denen die Risikoanalyse beruhte, sofern er diese nicht selbst an Ratepay übermittelt hat.
4.6 Mit der Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten zur Risikoanalyse schützen wir Sie vor einer möglichen Überschuldung, betrügerischer Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten sowie uns selbst vor einem Ausfallrisiko. Die Verarbeitung von Daten erfolgt nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO auf Grundlage berechtigter Interessen.
5. Zusammenarbeit mit Auskunfteien
5.1	Neben den vorgenannten anderen Datenkategorien beruht das Analyseergebnis auch auf den Scorings und Ratings von Auskunfteien. Scorings und Ratings sind statistisch begründete Schätzwerte über das künftige Risiko eines Zahlungsausfalls bei einer Person und werden als Zahlenwert dargestellt. Zur Einholung dieser Bewertungen von den Auskunfteien übermittelt Ratepay den Auskunfteien zunächst Daten im Zusammenhang mit dem Abschluss Ihres Vertrags mit dem Onlinehändler.
5.2	Wird die Zahlung an uns im Zusammenhang mit der Ratepay Zahlungsart nicht korrekt ausgeführt, so übermitteln wir die Informationen zu diesem Verzug an die Auskunfteien. Diese Verarbeitung ist im Interesse sämtlicher Teilnehmer am Wirtschaftsleben, der Vermeidung von Zahlungsverzug und einer Überschuldung von Verbrauchern und Schuldnern und beruht daher auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
5.3	Die Liste der Auskunfteien, mit denen Daten ausgetauscht werden können, finden Sie
hier
.
6. Datenverarbeitung bei der Vertragserfüllung
6.1 Wir verarbeiten Ihre Daten auch soweit dies erforderlich ist für den Zweck des Kaufs und der Forderungsabtretung aus der Vertragsbeziehung zwischen Ihnen und dem Onlinehändler, um den darauf folgenden Zahlungsvorgang durch Ratepay zu bearbeiten und im Zusammenhang mit Kontaktaufnahmen im vertraglichen Kontext. Insbesondere verarbeiten wir Ihre Kontodaten, um Lastschriften einzulösen, sowie Ihre Anschrift und E-Mail-Adresse, damit wir Ihnen Zahlungsinformationen zusenden können. Erforderlichenfalls übermitteln wir Daten in diesem Zusammenhang und zu diesem Zweck auch an unsere Zahlungspartner. Diese Verarbeitung ist erforderlich für die Vertragserfüllung und beruht auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.
6.2 Zur Durchsetzung offener Forderungen übermitteln wir Ihre Daten an Inkassobüros, die dann die weitere Forderungseintreibung in eigener Verantwortung übernehmen. Rechtsgrundlage der Verarbeitung ist unser berechtigtes Interesse an der Einziehung offener Forderungen nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
6.3 Zu Konzernsteuerungszwecken können wir Ihre Daten an unsere Konzernunternehmen übermitteln. Dies dient u.a. der Liquiditätsplanung und Konsolidierung auf Grundlage von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
6.4 Zum Teil übermitteln wir die Informationen, die für Ihren Bestellvorgang und den Zahlungsvorgang erheblich sind, an den Onlinehändler. Onlinehändler benötigen diese Informationen, um zu beurteilen, ob Gewährleistungsansprüche vorliegen oder um Informationen über Ihre Bestellung oder Kundendienstleistungen anzubieten. Diese Verarbeitung beruht daher auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO (berechtigtes Interesse) bzw., soweit es sich um Vertragsinformationen handelt, auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.
7. Bekämpfung von Betrug
7.1 Um den Missbrauch Ihrer Daten auszuschließen und finanzielle Verluste zu vermeiden, verarbeiten wir Ihre Daten, um betrügerische Handlungen auf Grundlage ungewöhnlichen Nutzungsverhaltens feststellen zu können. Zur Auswahl von Dienstleistern und um Betrugsfälle im Vorfeld feststellen und vermeiden zu können, übermitteln wir Ihre Daten an entsprechende Dienstleister mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten, die Ihre technischen Daten sowie die Bestelldaten einer Plausibilitätsprüfung unterziehen, beispielsweise um das Betrugsrisiko bei Bestellungen an eine andere Anschrift zu beurteilen. Zur Verbesserung der Betrugserkennung werden erkannte Betrugsfälle ggf. an Dienstleister zurückgemeldet.
7.2 Betrugsbekämpfungsmaßnamen beruhen u.a. auf Informationen dahingehend:
7.2.1 ob das Endgerät des Nutzers derzeit durch eine Proxy-Verbindung kommuniziert oder dies in der Vergangenheit getan hat,
7.2.2 ob sich das Endgerät kürzlich durch verschiedene Internetdienstanbieter eingewählt hat,
7.2.3 ob sich die Geo-Referenzierung des Endgeräts häufig ändert,
7.2.4 wie viele Internet-Transaktionen kürzlich durch das Gerät getätigt wurden (ohne die Möglichkeit, die Art der Transaktionen festzustellen),
7.2.5 mit welcher Wahrscheinlichkeit das in der Datenbank des Dienstleisters geführte Endgerät tatsächlich das Endgerät des Nutzers ist, und
7.2.6 ob vom Kunden bereitgestellte Informationen plausibel und schlüssig sind.
7.3 Die Verarbeitung zum Zwecke der Betrugsvermeidung erfolgt auf Grundlage von berechtigten Interessen nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO insbesondere im Hinblick auf unsere Verpflichtungen zur Betrugsprävention als Zahlungsdiensteanbieter. Die Verarbeitung erfolgt daneben im Interesse des Schutzes Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten vor unberechtigter Nutzung durch Dritte sowie im Interesse von Ratepay an der Vermeidung von Forderungsausfällen.
8. Weitere Verarbeitungszwecke und Dienstleister
8.1 Zur Herstellung eines Kontakts im Rahmen des Kundenservice (z.B. per E-Mail) nutzen wir Dienstleister, um durch automatisierte Verfahren Kosten einzusparen. Zur Sicherstellung des Schutzes Ihrer Daten haben wir diese Dienstleister in diesen Fällen vertraglich verpflichtet, Ihre Daten ausschließlich nach unseren Anweisungen zu verarbeiten.
Die Datenverarbeitung im Rahmen des Kundenservice ist im Interesse der Kommunikation mit Kunden und beruht auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b) DSGVO, soweit es sich um das Vertragsverhältnis und die Zahlungsabwicklung handelt und auf unserem berechtigten Interesse (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO), soweit es sich um allgemeine Anfragen handelt.
8.2 Um unserer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung nachzukommen, eingehende Zahlungen auf Geldwäscheverdacht zu prüfen, bedienen wir uns Dienstleistern. Diese Dienstleister sind vertraglich verpflichtet, Zahlungsdaten ausschließlich nach unseren Weisungen zu verarbeiten.
Im Übrigen ist die Verarbeitung zum Zwecke der Prüfung auf Geldwäscheverdacht zur Erfüllung unserer rechtlichen Verpflichtungen erforderlich und beruht auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. c) DSGVO in Verbindung mit den sich aus dem Geldwäschegesetz ergebenden Sorgfaltspflichten.
8.3 Soweit es datenschutzrechtlich zulässig ist, können wir Ihre Daten auch für neue Zwecke etwa für die Durchführung von Datenanalysen oder die Bereitstellung, Weiterentwicklung und Sicherheit unserer Services und Inhalte verwenden. Zudem verwenden wir Ihre Daten unter Einhaltung einschlägiger Datenschutzgesetze für Produktentwicklung, Optimierung von Geschäftsprozessen und die bedarfsgerechte Gestaltung unserer Services verarbeitet. Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass diese neuen Zwecke, für die die Daten genutzt werden sollen, bei der Erhebung der betreffenden Daten noch nicht feststanden bzw. noch nicht absehbar waren und die neuen Zwecke mit denjenigen Zwecken vereinbar sind, für die die betreffenden Daten ursprünglich erhoben worden sind. Beispielsweise können neue Entwicklungen im rechtlichen oder technischen Bereich und neuartige Geschäftsmodelle und Services zu neuen Verarbeitungszwecken führen.
8.4 Zur Realisierung der vertraglich gewünschten Services setzen wir Software- und IT-Dienstleister ein, die als Auftragsverarbeiter fungieren und uns die benötigten Server- und Rechenkapazitäten bereitstellen. Die vertraglichen Pflichten haben wir dabei in Auftragsverarbeitungsverträgen festgehalten. Dabei sind die Auftragsverarbeiter an unsere Weisungen gebunden und dürfen Ihre Daten ausschließlich zur Erfüllung der im Auftragsverarbeitungsvertrag formulierten Zwecke verarbeiten.
9. Erfüllung gesetzlicher Pflichten
9.1 Wir werden erforderliche Informationen an Behörden wie Polizei, Steuerbehörden oder andere Stellen mitteilen, soweit wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind oder wir ein berechtigtes Interesse an der Mitteilung haben. Ein Beispiel für entsprechende, gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Mitteilungen ist die Offenlegung zum Zwecke der Geldwäsche- und Terrorismusbekämpfung.
9.2 Soweit wir gesetzlich zur Mitteilung verpflichtet sind, beruht die Verarbeitung auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. c) DSGVO. Im Übrigen ist unser berechtigtes Interesse gem. Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO Grundlage der Verarbeitung.
10. Einwilligung
10.1 Falls Sie uns gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a) DSGVO eine Einwilligung in die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten erteilt haben, ist in erster Linie Ihre Einwilligung die Grundlage unserer Datenverarbeitung. Welche Ihrer Daten wir aufgrund Ihrer Einwilligung verarbeiten, hängt vom Zweck Ihrer Einwilligung ab.
10.2. Wir verarbeiten Ihre Daten auf der Grundlage einer Einwilligung gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a) DSGVO, sofern Sie uns diese erteilt haben, um Ihnen Informationen über Zahlungsoptionen zu übermitteln, die Ihnen gegebenenfalls zur Verfügung stehen.
11. E-Mail-Werbung für ähnliche Dienstleistungen
Wir können Ihnen auch ohne Einwilligung werbliche Inhalte per E-Mail senden, sofern diese Leistungen ähneln, die Sie zuvor von uns von in Anspruch genommenen haben. Rechtsgrundlage für diese Datenverarbeitung ist § 7 Abs. 3 UWG sowie Art. 6 Abs. 1 Satz 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
Wenn Sie an einer unserer Umfragen teilnehmen, verwenden wir Ihre Daten zur Markt- und Meinungsforschung. Wir werten die Daten grundsätzlich anonymisiert für interne Zwecke aus. Sofern Umfragen ausnahmsweise nicht anonym ausgewertet werden, werden die Daten ausschließlich mit Ihrer Einwilligung erhoben. Bei anonymen Umfragen ist die DSGVO nicht anwendbar und bei ausnahmsweise personenbezogenen Auswertungen ist Rechtsgrundlage die zuvor genannte Einwilligung nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a DSGVO.
Zur Durchführung von Umfragen verwenden wir die Dienste von Qualtrics Ireland Limited (nachfolgend ‚Qualtrics‘), Costello House, 1 Clarendon Row, Dublin 2, D02 TA43. Wir haben mit Qualtrics einen Auftragsverarbeitungsvertrag geschlossen.
12. Übermittlung von Daten außerhalb des EWR
Teilweise befindet sich die Unternehmenszentrale unserer Dienstleister außerhalb des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR). Soweit eine Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten in Staaten außerhalb des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR) erfolgt und für diese kein Angemessenheitsbeschluss der Europäischen Kommission verfügbar ist, verwenden wir Standardvertragsklauseln der Europäischen Kommission oder es bestehen verbindliche interne Datenschutzvorschriften um ein angemessenes Datenschutzniveau zu gewährleisten, deren Kopie über die o.g. Kontaktdaten angefordert werden kann oder wir stützen uns auf die Ausnahmeregelungen des Art. 49 Abs. 1 DSGVO.
13. Aufbewahrung und Speicherung von Daten
13.1 Grundsätzlich speichert Ratepay personenbezogene Daten nur so lange, wie zur Erfüllung der Zwecke erforderlich, zu denen wir die Daten erhoben haben. Danach löschen wir die Daten unverzüglich, es sei denn, wir benötigen die Daten noch zu Beweiszwecken für etwaige zivilrechtliche Ansprüche oder wegen gesetzlicher Aufbewahrungspflichten.
Ratepay bewahrt die über Sie im Zusammenhang mit der Anbahnung und der Bearbeitung des Forderungsankaufs erhobenen Daten für sechs Jahre auf. Darüber hinaus speichern wir Ihre Daten auch zur Betrugsprävention für sechs Jahre. Wir erfüllen so unsere gesetzliche Aufbewahrungspflicht als Zahlungsdienstleister gemäß § 30 Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz. Diese Fristen beginnen am Ende des Jahres, in dem der Forderungsankauf zustande kam oder zumindest angebahnt wurde. Rechtsgrundlage für diese Speicherung ist demnach Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. c DSGVO.
Auch danach müssen wir Ihre Daten teilweise noch aus buchhalterischen Gründen speichern. Wir sind dazu wegen gesetzlicher Dokumentationspflichten verpflichtet, die sich aus dem Handelsgesetzbuch, der Abgabenordnung, dem Kreditwesengesetz und dem Geldwäschegesetz ergeben können. Die dort vorgegebenen Fristen zur Aufbewahrung von Unterlagen betragen zwei bis zehn Jahre.
13.2 Der Zugriff auf diese Daten unterliegt strengen Beschränkungen. Grundsätzlich haben unsere Mitarbeiter keinen Zugriff auf Bonitätsinformationen. Angaben, die sich auf Zahlungsvorgänge im Zusammenhang mit an unsere Zahlungspartner abgetretene Forderungen beziehen, können jedoch diesen Zahlungspartnern auf Anfrage zur Verfügung gestellt werden, sofern und soweit die Zahlungspartner diese Angaben benötigt, um einer gesetzlichen Pflicht oder behördlichen Anordnung nachzukommen. Dies gilt nur für die Fälle, in denen wir die entsprechende Forderung an Zahlungspartner abgetreten haben. Einzelheiten dazu entnehmen Sie bitte Ihren Zahlungsinformationen. Rechtsgrundlage der Verarbeitung ist unser diesbezügliches berechtigtes Interesse (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).
13.3 Nach Ablauf der Aufbewahrungsfrist werden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten im Allgemeinen gesperrt und nach Ablauf der auf uns anwendbaren kaufmännischen und steuerlichen Vorschriften und/oder sonstigen gesetzlichen Aufbewahrungspflichten endgültig gelöscht oder anonymisiert. Danach ist es nicht mehr möglich, Rückschlüsse auf Ihre Person zu ziehen. Die anonymisierten Daten helfen uns allerdings dabei, unsere Risikoanalyse und unser Geschäftsmodell stetig zu optimieren. Wir haben daher ein berechtigtes Interesse an der nachfolgenden Anonymisierung der Daten (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).
14. Ihre Rechte in Bezug auf die Datenverarbeitung
14.1 Auskunftsrecht über Ihre verarbeiteten Daten (Art. 15 DSGVO)
Sie haben das Recht auf eine Auskunft darüber, welche Ihrer Daten von uns verarbeitet werden. sowie auf weitere Auskünfte gemäß Art. 15 DSGVO im Zusammenhang mit der Datenverarbeitung. Auf Wunsch stellen wir Ihnen gerne diese Daten und Informationen sowie Kopien dieser Daten zur Verfügung.
14.2 Recht auf Berichtigung Ihrer Daten (Art. 16 DSGVO)
Sie haben das Recht, die Berichtigung Ihrer Daten zu verlangen, falls diese unrichtig oder – unter Berücksichtigung der Zwecke der Verarbeitung – unvollständig sind.
14.3 Recht auf Löschung (Art. 17 DSGVO)
Sie haben ein Recht auf Löschung, sofern Daten nicht mehr benötigt werden, deren Verarbeitung unrechtmäßig ist oder einer der anderen der in Art. 17 DSGVO genannten Fälle zutrifft. In diesen Fällen werden wir Ihre Daten unverzüglich löschen.
14.4 Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten (Art. 18 DSGVO)
Sie haben das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten in den in Art. 18 DSGVO genannten Fällen zu verlangen. Dies umfasst u.a. den Fall, dass wir Daten an Orten oder in einem Ausmaß verarbeiten, aufgrund dessen die Datenverarbeitung nicht mehr rechtmäßig ist. Ferner könnte der Umstand relevant sein, das Daten einer Aufbewahrungspflicht unterliegen und wir diese Daten daher nicht ohne weiteres löschen können. In diesem Fall schränken wir die Datenverarbeitung ein, soweit dies möglich ist. Allgemein bedeutet eine „Einschränkung“, dass die Daten zwar noch gespeichert werden, aber Mitarbeiter keinen Zugriff auf dies Daten mehr haben.
14.5 Recht auf Datenübertragbarkeit (Art. 20 DSGVO)
Durch das „Recht auf Datenübertragbarkeit“ haben Sie das Recht, die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie uns bereitgestellt haben, in dem in Art. 20 DSGVO bezeichneten Format zu erhalten. Dies umfasst jedoch nicht jene Daten, die wir selbst als Folge der Verarbeitung selbst gewinnen (sog. Verarbeitungsergebnisse).
14.6 Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Arten der Verarbeitung, die auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO beruhen (Art. 21 DSGVO)
Wir stellen die auf Basis von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO erfolgende Verarbeitung von Daten ein, wenn Sie der Verarbeitung widersprechen (z.B. per E-Mail oder telefonisch) und Ihr Widerspruch gerechtfertigt ist.
14.7 Widerrufsrecht (Art. 7 DSGVO)
Sie können die uns von Ihnen zum Zeitpunkt des Vertragsschlusses zwischen Ihnen und dem Onlinehändler erteilten Einwilligungen jederzeit durch eine Mitteilung an Ratepay widerrufen (z.B. per E-Mail oder telefonisch). Wenn Sie Ihre Einwilligung widerrufen, werden Ihre Daten nicht mehr auf Grundlage dieser Einwilligung verarbeitet. Die Zulässigkeit der Datenverarbeitungen, die auf Grundlage Ihrer Einwilligung vor deren Widerruf vorgenommen wurden, wird durch den Widerruf nicht berührt; ebenso wird die Zulässigkeit von Datenverarbeitungen auf einer anderen rechtlichen Grundlage durch den Widerruf nicht berührt.
14.8 Beschwerderecht (Art. 77 DSGVO)
Sie haben das Recht, bei der Berliner Datenschutzbehörde (Berliner Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit) oder einer sonstigen für Datenschutzbehörde Beschwerde einzureichen.
15. Informationen im Falle einer Ablehnung
15.1 Wie kann es zu einer Ablehnung kommen?
Auf Grundlage der Risikobewertung entscheidet der Onlinehändler automatisch, ob er Ihre Bestellanfrage annimmt oder ablehnt.
Es kann vorkommen, dass die Ratepay Zahlungsarten für die Durchführung Ihres Kaufs für Ihre Bestellung nicht zur Verfügung stehen. Neben Gründen hinsichtlich der Bonität kann es dafür auch andere Gründe geben:
15.1.1 Die Kombination aus Ihrem Namen und Ihrer Anschrift konnte nicht gefunden werden. Dies kann bei Schreibfehlern, Umzügen oder Eheschließungen der Fall sein.
15.1.2 Sie haben eine abweichende Lieferanschrift, eine Packstation oder eine Firmenadresse anstelle Ihrer eingetragenen Anschrift als Rechnungsadresse angegeben.
15.1.3 Der persönliche Einkaufsrahmen wurde mit der Bestellanfrage überschritten. Dazu kann es kommen, wenn noch zu viele unbezahlte Bestellungen vorliegen.
15.2 Was können Sie im Falle einer Ablehnung tun?
Steht Ihre bevorzugte Ratepay Zahlungsart nicht zur Verfügung, so können Sie selbstverständlich eine andere vom Onlinehändler angebotene Zahlungsart nutzen, wie z.B. Kreditkartenzahlung.
Wenn Sie vermuten, dass die Ablehnung beispielsweise auf einem unrichtigen Dateneintrag beruht, so können Sie die Bestellung beim Onlinehändler erneut aufgeben und die richtigen Daten eintragen.
Gibt es noch offene oder unbezahlte Bestellungen, so prüfen und begleichen Sie diese bitte.
Nehmen Sie direkt Kontakt mit der Auskunftei auf und prüfen Sie, ob die dort verarbeiteten Daten aktuell und richtig sind.
Ist der Grund für die Ablehnung aus Ihrer Sicht dann immer noch unklar, so stehen wir zu Ihrer Verfügung. Bitte verwenden Sie das Kontaktformular auf unserer Website für Ihre Anfrage.

The parties mentioned above may be established in jurisdictions other than your own and outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.

In particular, for transfers of your Personal Data within PayPal related companies, we rely on Binding Corporate Rules approved by competent Supervisory Authorities (

). Other transfers may be based on contractual protections. Please contact us for more information about this.

13. Additional Information
Banking Regulations Notice for Customers in the EEA
In general, the Luxembourg laws to which PayPal’s handling of user data is subject (data protection and bank secrecy) require a higher degree of transparency than most other EU laws. This is why, unlike the vast majority of providers of internet-based services or financial services in the EU, PayPal has listed in this Privacy Statement the third party service providers and business partners to whom we may disclose your data, together with the purpose of disclosure and type of information disclosed. You will find a link to those third parties
here
. By accepting this Privacy Statement and maintaining an account with PayPal, you expressly consent to the transfer of your data to those third parties for the purposes listed.
PayPal may update the list of third parties referred to above every quarter (January 1st, April 1st, July 1st and October 1st). PayPal will only start transferring any data to any of the new entities or for the new purposes or data types indicated in each update after 30 days from the date when that list is made public through this Privacy Statement. You should review the list each quarter on the PayPal website on the dates stated above. If you do not object to the new data disclosure, within 30 days after the publication of the updated list of third parties, you are deemed to have accepted the changes to the list and to this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with the changes, you may close your account and stop using our services.
In order to provide the PayPal Services, certain of the information we collect (as set out in this Privacy Statement) may be required to be transferred to other PayPal related companies or other entities, including those referred to in this section in their capacity as payment providers, payment processors or account holders (or similar capacities). You acknowledge that according to their local legislation, such entities may be subject to laws, regulations, inquiries, investigations, or orders which may require the disclosure of information to the relevant authorities of the relevant country. Your use of the PayPal Services constitutes your consent to our transfer of such information to provide you the PayPal Services.
Specifically, you consent to and direct PayPal to do any and all of the following with your information:
a. Disclose necessary information to: the police and other law enforcement agencies; security forces; competent governmental, intergovernmental or supranational bodies; competent agencies, departments, regulatory authorities, self-regulatory authorities or organisations (including, without limitation, the Agencies referenced in the “Agencies” section of the Third Party Provider List here) and other third parties, including PayPal Group companies, that (i) we are legally compelled and permitted to comply with, including but without limitation the Luxembourg laws of 24 July 2015 on the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA Law”) and 18 December 2015 on the OECD common reporting standard (“CRS Law”); (ii) we have reason to believe it is appropriate for us to cooperate with in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity or potential illegal activity, or (iii) to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement (including without limitation, your funding source or credit or debit card provider).
If you are covered by the FATCA or CRS Law, we are required to give you notice of the information about you that we may transfer to various authorities. Please read more about PayPal's obligations under the FATCA and CRS Law and how they could affect you as well as take note of the information we may disclose as result.
We and other organisations, including parties that accept PayPal, may also share, access and use (including from other countries) necessary information (including, without limitation the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies) to help us and them assess and to manage risk (including, without limitation, to prevent fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing). Please contact us if you want to receive further details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies. For more information on these Agencies, fraud prevention agencies and other third parties, click
here
.
b. Disclose Account Information to intellectual property right owners if under the applicable national law of an EU member state they have a claim against PayPal for an out-of-court information disclosure due to an infringement of their intellectual property rights for which PayPal Services have been used (for example, but without limitation, Sec. 19, para 2, sub-section 3 of the German Trademark Act or Sec. 101, para 2, sub-section 3 of the German Copyright Act).
c. Disclose necessary information in response to the requirements of the credit card associations or a civil or criminal legal process.
d. If you as a merchant use a third party to access or integrate PayPal, we may disclose to any such partner necessary information for the purpose of facilitating and maintaining such an arrangement (including, without limitation, the status of your PayPal integration, whether you have an active PayPal account and whether you may already be working with a different PayPal integration partner).
e. Disclose necessary information to the payment processors, auditors, customer services providers, credit reference and fraud agencies, financial products providers, commercial partners, marketing and public relations companies, operational services providers, group companies, agencies, marketplaces and other third parties listed
here
. The purpose of this disclosure is to allow us to provide PayPal Services to you. We also set out in the list of third parties, under each " Category", non-exclusive examples of the actual third parties (which may include their assigns and successors) to whom we currently disclose your Account Information or to whom we may consider disclosing your Account Information, together with the purpose of doing so, and the actual information we disclose (except as explicitly stated, these third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information was shared).
f. Disclose necessary information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
g. Disclose aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in Manchester. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personal information.
h. Share necessary Account Information with unaffiliated third parties (listed
here
) for their use for the following purposes:
Fraud Prevention and Risk Management: to help prevent fraud or assess and manage risk. For example, if you use the PayPal Services to buy or sell goods using eBay Inc, or its affiliates (“eBay”), we may share Account Information with eBay in order to help protect your accounts from fraudulent activity, alert you if we detect such fraudulent activity on your accounts, or evaluate credit risk.
As part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we also may share necessary Account Information with eBay in cases where PayPal has placed a hold or other restriction on your account based on disputes, claims, chargebacks or other scenarios regarding the sale or purchase of goods. Also, as part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we may share Account Information with eBay to enable them to operate their programmes for evaluating buyers or sellers.
Customer Service: for customer service purposes, including to help service your accounts or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or transactional).
Shipping: in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using PayPal.
Legal Compliance: to help them comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.
Service Providers: to enable service providers under contract with us to support our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, customer service and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.

If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.

We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use
automated systems
to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or
Professional Community Policies
.
1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information
When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.
Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “
LinkedIn Page
” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.

Affiliates
Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation.
2. How We Use Your Data
We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.
How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your
settings
. We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. You can review LinkedIn's Responsible AI principles

2.1 Services
Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
Stay Connected
Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their
settings
, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can
choose
whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
Visitors have
choices
about how we use their data.
Stay Informed
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were
mentioned in the news
.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
interested
in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your
settings
allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.

2.2 Premium Services
Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you
opt-out
. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include
TeamLink
and
LinkedIn Pages
(e.g., content analytics and followers).
2.3 Communications
We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication
preferences

We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn
tag
on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,
groups
participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising
partners
, vendors and
publishers
; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).

about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
Learn more
about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our
European Regional Privacy Notice
.
We will show you ads called
sponsored content
which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
Ad Choices
You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings
can be found here
. For Visitors,
the setting is here
.
Info to Ad Providers
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
2.5 Marketing
We promote our Services to you and others.
In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
2.6 Developing Services and Research
We develop our Services and conduct research
Service Development
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct
research
and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
Other Research
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these
jobs
and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under
controls
that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to
researchers
to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
Surveys
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may
opt-out
of survey invitations.
2.7 Customer Support
We use data to help you and fix problems.
We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
We use your
data
to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your
settings
, for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a
post
or LinkedIn
Page
, to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
2.9 Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our
User Agreement
and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
Social Action
E.g. like, comment, follow, share
Partners
Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services
Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
Profile
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a
group
, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your
settings
.
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your
settings
where applicable.
Subject to your
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you
choices
about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
Enterprise Accounts
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
Subject to your
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
3.2 Communication Archival
Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
3.3 Others’ Services
You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
Subject to your
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may
revoke
the link with such accounts.
The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages)
may be available to them on other services
. For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your
settings
), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
3.4 Related Services
We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services.
Where allowed
, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
3.5 Service Providers
We may use others to help us with our Services.
We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
3.6 Legal Disclosures
We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our
Data Request Guidelines
and
Transparency Report
.
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
4. Your Choices & Obligations
4.1 Data Retention
We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.

We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have
restricted
your account for breach of our
Professional Community Policies
), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache.
