See below for more specific details concerning the information we collect, why we collect it, how it’s used, and your rights with regard to your information.
The information we collect
We collect all of the following types of information (collectively “Information”). Additionally, from here on out, any reference to “children” means individuals under the age of 13 in the United States, or under the age threshold specified by your country of residence for distinguishing children online.
Children's Information: We collect what is reasonably necessary for us to provide children with access to Animal Jam, such as a username, password, demographic information, and a parental email address. If parents provide consent for their children to use social functionality in Animal Jam, we may also collect message logs to help us keep our players safe. The data we collect may include the following types of information:
“Personal Information” is information about an individual which could be used to identify, contact, or locate that person or their computing device (for example, their real name, physical address, device ID, IP address, phone number, or online username).
“Anonymous Information” is non-personal information that, by itself, does not identify a specific individual or device (for example, broad demographic information, anonymized usage data, or an anonymized tally of active players).
“Financial Information” is information you provide in connection with payments and billing, such as your credit card account information and billing address. We do not knowingly collect Financial Information from children, although we may collect it from parents in the course of processing payments they initiate.
“Parent Information” is information specific to the parent or adult guardian overseeing a child’s Animal Jam account. For example, we collect a parental email address when a child creates an Animal Jam account, in order to obtain adult permission to save the account and provide an interface for the parent or guardian to manage the account. We may collect this information from the child or the parent.
Other information: If you or your child uses our websites, we may collect information about the browser or IP address used to identify the country of origin. We may be able to see which site you visited that linked to ours, or which site you visit next. We may collect passive information about what Animal Jam activities players engage in and how long they play. We only use this information to support our internal operations, and we don’t share this information with third parties unless it’s necessary to support our internal operations, and the third party has been reasonably certified as compliant with all relevant children’s online data protection laws.
You can review your child's Personal Information by emailing us or by using your Parent Account. You may also request that we no longer collect Personal Information from your child, or have us delete your child's Personal Information we have collected. To do so, email us at privacy@animaljam.com.
How we collect information
We collect Information directly.
For example, if you or your child submits Information in order to create an account with us, or otherwise contacts us directly.
We collect Information passively.
We use a variety of internal and third-party tools to passively monitor user activity in our products, which we use to improve our products and provide services to you. See “Third Parties” below for details about these tools, the Information collected, and how we use it.
How we use information
How we use children's Personal Information.
Unless permitted by law, we only store and use a child’s Personal Information after obtaining parental consent. In the following circumstances we may not request this parental consent:
If we are only going to use the Information one time to respond to a direct request;
If we are using the Parent Information submitted by a child to request consent to store the child’s account (for example, when a child provides their parent’s email address for this purpose)
If there is a COPPA exception that applies
How we use parent and guardian Personal Information.
We use the Personal Information that parents and guardians provide to keep them informed about their children's Animal Jam experience. We use email addresses to notify parents or guardians that their children have registered on our site, and ask if they consent to their child using our sites and apps. We also use their Information to communicate with them about child accounts. For example, we use parent email addresses to enable parents and guardians to create Parent Accounts, where they can provide or revoke consent for their child’s use of different features of our apps and sites. If we do not get consent within 14 days, then the email used to register the account will be deleted.
We use Information to improve our products and services.
We use Information to make our websites and products better, and to customize our users’ experience with us. For example, we collect a unique password for each child and parent account, which we use to store and secure the account. Animal Jam offers social features like Safe Chat (more info found
here
) that players may access with parental permission, which parents can control through their Parent Account. We collect and use chat information to monitor the gameplay experience and promote safety.
We use Information for security purposes.
We may use any Information we collect to protect our company, our users, and our products.
We use Information for marketing purposes.
For example, we may use Personal Information to send adults details about new site features. With their permission, we may use Personal Information to send adults product offers or information we think they will find interesting.
We use Information as otherwise disclosed and permitted by law.
For example, we use Information internally to provide Animal Jam services and respond to users’ questions.
Third Parties
We share Information with certain third parties.
We will share Information if we're required by law to do so; for example, in response to a court order or subpoena. We may share Information if a government agency or investigatory body makes a lawful request that will benefit and protect our users; for example, we may share Information with investigators if we are investigating potential fraud.
Some game features allow players to share monitored communications and interactions with other players, and that communication may contain personal information. These features are only available to child accounts when verified parental consent to use them is obtained.
We share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.
For example, we share Personal Information and Anonymous Information with vendors who help us send emails and operate our sites. Users may optionally share Personal Information and Financial Information with third parties in order to complete payments to WildWorks, but this information is not collected or stored by us.
Third-party operators who collect persistent identifiers from our sites and applications are vetted to ensure their data protection practices comply with applicable laws and best practices regarding the handling of children’s data.

You may be able to control online ‘cookies’ and tracking tags through your internet device or web browser. How you do so depends on your browser or access device, and the type of cookie.

California Privacy Rights
Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You are hereby notified that we do not share our customers’ personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) also provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. You have the right to request that WildWorks disclose to you certain specific information about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.
To exercise your rights to access, data portability, and deletion under the CCPA, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Emailing our Data Protection Officer at privacy@wildworks.com
Submit your request through postal mail at this address:
Animal Jam
Attn: Data Protection Officer
650 S 500 W
Salt Lake City, UT 84101
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that is authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request in connection with your rights under the CCPA. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within any 12-month period. The verifiable request must include the following:
Sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we connected personal information, or that you are the authorized representative of that person, and;
A description of your request, with sufficient detail for us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information unless we can verify your identity or your authority to make the request, and confirm that the information requested relates to you.
We will only use the personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request, and to research and fulfill the requests that are verified.
California Privacy Rights for Minor Users
Since January 1, 2015, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, to view, correct, or remove information provided by you or publicly posted by you, by accessing your Animal Jam account and editing/removing your Information. You will need your password to access your personal account. You may also send us an email asking us to remove certain posted content at support@animaljam.com, or mail your request to us at:
Animal Jam
Attn: Data Protection Officer
650 S 500 W
Salt Lake City, UT 84101
We will be happy to review, update, or remove Information as required by law. Residual copies of information or content that have been removed from your account may remain in our backup systems for approximately one month. We may still retain your information required to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, or comply with legal requirements; in this case, your personal information will be blocked from use for any other purpose.
Security
At WildWorks the security of your Information and the protection of our players is a top organizational priority. However, no data system (including the internet itself) is 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of Animal Jam will be entirely without risk. We encourage players to use caution when using the internet, including Animal Jam services. Of particular importance is for players never to share their passwords, contact information, or any other personal information  inside or outside of Animal Jam.
We carefully filter and moderate our online chat. We also filter usernames and attempt to ensure they don't incorporate children’s Personal Information. Parents, there are important steps you can take to protect kids online too. To learn more about how to protect your child online, see this helpful

Information we store may be stored both within and outside of the United States. If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your information to the United States. Animal Jam and WildWorks are subject to U.S. laws, which may not afford the same level of protection as those in your country.
Data Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as is appropriate or relevant for the practices described in this Policy, including accessing and servicing accounts, providing help to players, communicating with parents and guardians, resolving disputes, and as is required by law.
