Post Notification:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />

Android 13 (API level 33) and higher supports a runtime permission for sending non-exempt (including Foreground Services (FGS)) notifications from an app: POST_NOTIFICATIONS. This change helps users focus on the notifications that are most important to them.
FOREGROUND SERVICE:
Foreground services show a status bar notification, to make users aware that your app is performing a task in the foreground and is consuming system resources.

Devices that run Android 12 (API level 31) or higher provide a streamlined experience for short-running foreground services. On these devices, the system waits 10 seconds before showing the notification associated with a foreground service. There are a few exceptions, as several types of services always display a notification immediately.
USER AD ID
:
<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID" />

- The advertising ID is a unique, user-resettable ID for advertising, provided by Google Play services. It gives users better controls and provides developers with a simple, standard system to continue to monetize their apps. It enables users to reset their identifier or opt-out of personalized ads (formerly known as interest-based ads) within Google Play apps.
