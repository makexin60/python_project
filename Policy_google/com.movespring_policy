What we do at MoveSpring
At MoveSpring, a Reward Gateway | Edenred company, our mission is to make fitness fun and accessible for individuals of all activity levels. We aim to empower people to lead a healthier life and provide a community that supports them along their fitness journey.
To provide this Service to you, we collect some information about you. We appreciate that you share this information with us. We work hard to make sure your information is secure and private. We also want to be transparent with you on what we collect, how we use it and what you can do to control your information.
How we gather information
Information you provide us
Account Information:
You provide us with information when you create an account such as your name, email, username, and password. This information is required for account creation. You may also share a profile photo and your activity preferences.
Additional Information:
When you use our Service and interact with certain features, you may choose to provide us with additional information such as chats, messages on group threads or discussion boards, comments, likes, and logs for things like your mood, food, or other specified habits.
If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest or promotion, we gather the information you provide such as name, contact info, organization or company name, and message.
Payment and Card Information:
If you give us credit card information, we use it solely to check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.
Information from using our services
Device and Activity Information:
Your fitness tracking device or mobile smartphone collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like your steps, distance traveled and active minutes moved. Not every device tracks every one of these metrics. The data collected varies depending on the device you use. When your device syncs with our applications and software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device or device app to our service.
When you pair your device to your account, you grant us access to your exercise or activity data from that device service. You can use your account settings and tools to withdraw this consent at any time by stopping use of a feature, removing our access to a third-party service, unpairing your device, or deleting your data or your account.
Location Information:
We collect your timezone. This is either gathered from your mobile device, your connected fitness device or is manually set by you. We use timezone to allow challenges to start and end locally at the same time for everyone participating in the challenge. You can change your timezone at any time in your profile settings.
Usage information:
When you access or use our Services, we retain certain usage data. This includes information about your interaction with our Services such as how long you’re in our app or what you’re viewing in our app.
We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access our Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, fitness device type or mobile device information, the referring web page and pages visited.
How we use information
Provide and maintain our services
We use things like your activity information, username, and location to run things like challenges, groups and other core services listed in our Terms & Services. This includes things like scoring your activity in a challenge, populating your dashboard and personal trends, enabling our community features, and providing you with support.
Develop and improve our services
By using our product, you’re constantly helping us to improve! We take a look at what is resonating with most of our users to ensure we can continue to create useful features that you love. We’re always looking to make our existing features better and how you interact with our product helps us decide what improvements should be made.
Communicate with you
We use your information to communicate important service, account or support updates. This allows us to provide relevant information about our product and to respond to you when you contact us. You can always turn off your marketing preferences by unsubscribing at the bottom of emails and by adjusting your app notifications in your profile settings.
Keep our services safe and secure
It’s important that you’re always safe and secure when using our services. We use some of your information to ensure we are only allowing secure usage by authenticating your account details, protecting against fraud and abuse and enforcing our terms and policies.
How we protect your data
We work hard to keep your data safe by implementing appropriate technology safeguards, security policies, and other measures. This includes using a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls, such as suitable access controls, robust physical security measures, and encryption, including Transport Layer Security (TLS), for many of our services. Additionally, we ensure that all employees and others who access or process your data respect your confidentiality. While no method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, if you have any security-related concerns, please contact customer support.
How we share information
When you agree or ask us to share
If you choose to participate in a challenge, information like your profile photo, posted messages, total steps in the challenge, personal statistics, and achievements will be visible to all other challenge participants.
If you sign up for our service through an employer or organization, remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with organizational or employee wellness programs by deleting your personal account or asking your administrator to remove you from the organization account.
MoveSpring does not control the way our organizational clients or admins use our tool. They control the configuration of groups, challenges, content, and communications associated with hosting a wellness program.
Corporate Events
If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by MoveSpring. If this does occur, you will be notified of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Compelled Disclosure
We reserve the right to use or disclose your personal information if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process.
We never sell personal information
We will not sell, rent, transfer, or disclose your personal information to advertisers or other third parties.

Your Rights
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights to:
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below);
Request the restriction of processing of your personal information, for example if you want to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and
Obtain a copy of the personal information you’ve provided us with and to reuse it elsewhere or to ask us to transfer it to a third party of your choice.
You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object to where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, for example in relation to any direct marketing we provide to you, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent in relation to direct marketing, please contact us using any of the details set out below in the “Contacting Us” section.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please do contact us in the first instance.

Contacting Us
If you have any comments or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or have any data protection enquiries or queries, you can contact us in the following ways:
By email at
dpo.uk@edenred.com
or;
By post at Reward Gateway (UK) Ltd, Third Floor, 1 Dean Street, London, W1D 3RB.
Reward Gateway Pty Limited (
"we"
,
"us"
or
"our"
) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act) and other applicable laws.
This Privacy Notice ("Notice") describes how we collect, store, use, disclose, share and secure any personal information ("Personal Information") we collect from you or from third parties, including Citi (the
"administrator"
) who we have entered into a Licence Agreement with, about you on this website (the "programme",
"My Perks"
) will be processed by us.
In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Notice and the terms of the Licence Agreement, the Licence Agreement shall prevail.
We have appointed a Data Protection Team, who can be contacted using the details at the end of this notice should you have any questions, complaints or feedback about your privacy.
Information We Collect From You and How We Use It
We will collect various types of personal information from you when you use My Perks, depending on the particular services which you use. Further details of how we use your personal information are set out below.
Before you register
Before you register on My Perks, to allow us to carry out our eligibility checks we will ask the administrator to provide two pieces of information about you (such as your postcode, payroll ID, start date or date of birth).
The administrator has provided us with your information for an account to be created.
When you register
In addition to the personal information provided to us by the Administrator, when you register on My Perks we will also collect and store some personal information about you, such as your name, company identifier, email address, password, postcode, contact telephone number, gender and date of birth. At the Administrator’s choice, we may also collect additional information about you such as your office location.
You will also need to provide the information necessary to allow us to carry out our eligibility check (which will vary dependent on the information provided by the Administrator, see above).
This information will be used in order to complete your registration and to allow you to use My Perks. You will not be able to register without at least providing your name, email address, password and postcode or date of birth, as these are used to secure your account and to allow us to confirm your identity if you contact the support team.
When you login
Each time you log in to My Perks, we automatically conduct checks against your Internet Protocol (IP) address to ensure your security. This includes looking up your IP address against a “proxy denylist” to check that someone is not using your credentials and trying to hide their location. This proxy denylist is operated by MaxMind, Inc. If your IP address appears on it, we will not allow you to login.
We also look up the IP address in a static database we download from MaxMind Inc. to check which country the IP is affiliated with. This helps us to further protect your account against people who may have access to your credentials. If we do spot a change, we will alert you and ask you to confirm your login in order to verify your identity before continuing.
This information along with time and event data (such as successful or failed logins) are also recorded in our database for audit purposes.
Depending on the services you use on My Perks, we may collect and process additional personal information about you, as set out below.
When you write a blog or comment / react to content

-------------------------
Reward Gateway (UK) Ltd (
"we"
,
"us"
or
"our"
) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
This Privacy Notice ("Notice") sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you or from third parties, including Reward Gateway (the
"administrator"
) who we have entered into a Licence Agreement with, about you on this website (the "programme",
"boom! Discounts UK"
) will be processed by us.
We will be the Data Controller of your personal data which you provide to us or which is collected by us via boom! Discounts UK. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you and that we are required to notify you of the information contained in this Privacy Notice (
"Statement"
). It is important that you read this Statement so that you are aware of how and why we are using your personal information and how we will treat it.
We have appointed a Data Protection Team, who can be contacted using the details at the end of this Notice should you have any questions, complaints or feedback about your privacy.
The Type of Information We Collect From You and How We Use It
We will collect various types of personal information from you when you use boom! Discounts UK, depending on the services which you use. Further details of how we use your personal data are set out below.
In this section, we have indicated with asterisks whether we need to process your personal data:
* to enter into and/or to perform our contract with you to provide the services via boom! Discounts UK;
** to pursue legitimate interests of our own or of third parties, provided that your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests;
*** to enable us to comply with our legal obligations; and/or
**** with your consent.
Before you register
Before you register on boom! Discounts UK, to allow us to carry out our eligibility checks* we will ask the administrator to provide two pieces of unique information about you (such as your postcode, start date or date of birth).
The administrator has provided us with your information for an account to be created.
The administrator will sometimes also provide the information necessary to allow us to conduct National Minimum Wage and Basic Earnings assessments automatically on their behalf when we are required to do so***/** (see When you enter into a salary deduction agreement with the administrator section below for more details).
When you register
In addition to the personal data provided to us by the administrator, when you register on boom! Discounts UK we will also collect and store personal information about you, such as your name, company identifier, email address, password, postcode, a contact telephone number, gender and date of birth. At the administrator’s choice, we may also collect additional information about you such as your office location.
You will also need to provide the information necessary to allow us to carry out our eligibility check (which will vary dependent on the information provided by the administrator, see above).
This information will be used in order to complete your registration and to allow you to use boom! Discounts UK*. You will not be able to register without at least providing your name, email address and password, as these are used to secure your account and to allow us to confirm your identity if you contact the support team.
When you login
Each time you log in to boom! Discounts UK, we automatically conduct checks against your Internet Protocol (IP) address to ensure your security. This includes looking up your IP address against a “proxy denylist” to check that someone is not using your credentials and trying to hide their location**. This proxy denylist is operated by MaxMind, Inc. If your IP address appears on it, we will not allow you to login.
We also look up the IP address in a static database we download from MaxMind Inc. to check which country the IP is affiliated with. This helps us to further protect your account against people who may have access to your credentials**. If we do spot a change, we will alert you that a login has occured from a new device or location.
This information along with time and event data (such as successful or failed logins) are also recorded in our database for audit purposes**.
Depending on the services you use on boom! Discounts UK, we may collect and process additional personal data about you, as set out below.
When you use Cashback
If you visit a Cashback retailer on boom! Discounts UK, we will record that you clicked and visited their website for the purpose of tracking the Cashback earned*. We will provide the retailer with a pseudo-anonymous ‘click reference’ to allow us to attribute the purchase and Cashback to you.
Each of these retailers are independent on boom! Discounts UK so you should check their privacy terms to make sure you are happy with them before providing any other details to them.
If you have a problem with the retailer and your Cashback, we may need to provide them with additional information about your order to help**. We will ask you for the minimum information we need to do this, but you will be responsible for the accuracy and level of detail it contains.
When you withdraw your Cashback
If you make a request for a Cashback withdrawals to your bank account, you will need to provide your bank details for us to process the withdrawal but we will only store your bank details until the withdrawal is processed*. They will be shared with our bank, HSBC, to process your request after which all the details will be destroyed.
Alternatively you will be able to withdraw your Cashback as part or full payment for goods on boom! Discounts UK or ask us to donate it to the nominated charity on boom! Discounts UK*.
When you make a debit or credit card purchase
If you choose to purchase goods using a credit or debit card through boom! Discounts UK, we will collect your payment details from you and pass them to Checkout.com, our secure payment processors, who will use them to process the payment*. We do not store or process your credit or debit details on our servers.
We will also collect your delivery address from you, and use the contact details previously provided, to allow us to process the order*.
If you opt-in to saving your credit or debit details for future use on boom! Discounts UK, your information will be stored securely by our payment processor. You can update or remove these at any time.
Where goods are dispatched by a third-party supplier, we may need to share your information with them to fulfil your order, such as your contact details and delivery address*. This will be clearly indicated to you at the point of purchase. You will be able to review these suppliers’ privacy terms before any information is shared with them.
We will also carry out a fraud check during the order process. This check is carried out by our third party provider, Sift Science (“Sift Science”)**. Sift Science will only act in accordance with our instructions and how they will process your personal data is set out below.
Sift Science will collect information about your behaviour on the portal (such as the length of time between logging in and reaching checkout), technical information about the device used (such as your browser version and IP address) and the details you enter at checkout (such as your contact details and delivery and billing address).
After you have placed your order and before goods are dispatched, Sift Science will use this information to provide us with a score based on the likelihood of fraud. The score provided determines whether your order is automatically accepted by us or queued for our human review. If it is queued for human review, we will carry out a manual fraud check to decide whether to accept or refuse your order or, in some circumstances, require payment to be made by an alternative, more secure mechanism such as a bank transfer. For more information about this processing activity, please contact us using the details provided at the end of this Notice in the “Contacting Us” section.
After too many failed orders
If too many failed orders originate from your account, we will automatically restrict access to your account. Before allowing you to access your account again, we will notify you and ask you for further supporting documents such as your driving licence, council tax bill or statement, bank or credit card statement, utility bill or payslip, as evidence that it is you attempting these orders**. If these documents are not to our satisfaction, we may contact the administrator with the intention of verifying that it is you using your account in this way**.
These supporting documents will only be used for the purpose of verifying your identity, will not be shared with any third parties and will only be retained by us until we have reviewed them, even if we are not satisfied with their legitimacy or authenticity.
You do not need to provide these supporting documents to us but, if you choose not to, then we will not be able to provide you with access to your account.
When you enter into a salary deduction agreement with the administrator
If you choose to purchase goods through boom! Discounts UK and enter into a salary deduction agreement with the administrator, such as Childcare Vouchers, Cycle to Work, Smart Tech or Holiday Trading, we will collect your name, address, IP address, browser details, payroll information, and deduction amount. This information will be provided to the administrator as proof of your electronic signature of the salary deduction agreement and to enable them to administer the deduction and pay us for the goods on your behalf*.
Additionally, if the administrator has provided us with the information necessary such as your payroll and salary information (see
National minimum wage and national living wage
for more details), we will use this information to conduct the National Minimum Wage check on their behalf in line with the parameters they have provided***. The employer is legally obliged to conduct such as check.
If they have not provided us with this information, we will ask you to provide it instead.
If the administrator provided us with the information necessary to conduct the National Minimum Wage check, we will conduct the check and automatically approve or forward your application for salary sacrifice benefits to them for review. For more information about this processing activity, please contact us using the details provided at the end of this Notice in the “Contacting Us” section.
If you provide us with the information necessary to conduct the National Minimum Wage check, then we will conduct the check but the results of all checks will be forwarded for review by the administrator before your application is approved or rejected. If you are not eligible, you can contest the assessment with the administrator.
You will not be able to purchase goods through boom! Discounts UK via a salary deduction agreement unless you or the administrator provide this information to us.
We will also provide the information necessary to the relevant third party benefit provider (see the Disclosures of your Information section) to allow them to provide the benefit to you. This information will vary by benefit provider but will usually contain at least your name and application amount.
Special Information for Cycle to Work
When you use Cycle to Work to purchase a bike and/or safety equipment, in addition to processing your personal data as set out in the ‘When you enter into a salary deduction agreement with the administrator’ section above, we will also process your personal data as set out below.
At the end of the Hire Period, when you have finished paying via the salary deduction agreement, the administrator cannot simply give you the equipment as this may turn the purchase into a benefit in kind. Instead you will be offered, depending on the administrator, either to make a final payment through a P11D or to continue the agreement with our chosen supplier until the equipment has no residual value (you can read more about this in the Employment Income Manual - see
Employment Income Manual
.)
If the administrator has selected to allow you to continue the agreement, your application details, including your name, email address, telephone number, and postal address must be transferred to our supplier*. We will contact you about this process.
Special Information for Smart Tech
When you use SmartTech to purchase technology, your personal information is not shared with a third-party supplier. We obtain vouchers direct from our supplier and issue them to you when you choose to participate in SmartTech.
Special information for Childcare Vouchers
When you enter in to a salary deduction agreement with the administrator for Childcare Vouchers, in addition to processing your personal data as set out in the ‘When you enter into a salary deduction agreement with the administrator’ section above, we will also process your personal data as set out below.
We are under a statutory obligation to conduct an ongoing eligibility check on you based on the age of your youngest child*** and we will require you to provide their date of birth for us to carry out that check. This information is only used to perform this check and to remind you when they enter their last school year that your eligibility is coming to an end.
Additionally, if the administrator has provided us with the information necessary such as your payroll and salary information (see
Employer-supported Childcare - guidance and FAQs for employers
for more details), we will use this information to conduct a Basic Earnings Assessment check on their behalf***. The employer is legally obliged to conduct such a check.
If the employer provided us with the necessary information to conduct the Basic Earning Assessments check, we will conduct the check and automatically approve or forward your application for Childcare Vouchers for review by the administrator. For more information about this processing activity, please contact us using the details provided at the end of this Notice in the “Contacting Us” section.
If you provide us with the necessary information to conduct the Basic Earning Assessments check instead, then we will conduct the check but the results of all checks will be forwarded for review by the administrator before your application is approved or rejected.
You will not be able to purchase Childcare Vouchers through boom! Discounts UK via a salary deduction agreement unless you or the administrator provide this information to us.
When you take out a Healthcare Cashplan
If you decide to purchase a Healthcare Cashplan through boom! Discounts UK, we will ask for your bank account details. These are used to allow our Healthcare Cashplan provider to set up a Direct Debit for all future payments*. We will pass your bank details directly to the provider to allow them to set up the Direct Debit. We will also provide the Healthcare Cashplan provider with your name, telephone number, date of birth, gender, details of any existing medical conditions and selected plan (and your partner’s if you choose this option) to allow them to provide the benefit to you.

Except as set out elsewhere in this Statement, we will only share information with the administrator on an aggregated and anonymous basis about how often you’ve used the website and what services you used. If you use our SmartSpending discounts product, we will not share information with the administrator about how much you’ve spent, where you shop, and how much you’ve saved as an individual, as we treat this as confidential.
Our Internal Teams and Prospective Retailers
We also use information about you on an aggregated and anonymised basis for internal management purposes, to, share it with current or prospective retailers and to use it to target offers that are made to users of boom! Discounts UK. This type of information includes, for example, the types of product that you purchase and the value of those purchases. However, you can’t be identified from this information.

if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets; and/or
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, customers and providers. This will include sharing your information as part of a legal or official investigation if we have evidence or reason to suspect that transactions on your account could be fraudulent.
International Transfers of your Personal Data
Reward Gateway's commitment to data security and privacy is paramount. We host all our personal data in Ireland and Germany in a highly secure environment, ensuring it remains within the European Economic Area (EEA).

We can supply a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to you on request.
Your Rights
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights to:
request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
We
may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact us using any of the details set out below in the “Contacting Us” section or change your preferences in the "Communication Preferences" section, under “My Account” within boom!

-------------------------
Reward Gateway (USA) Inc (“
we
”, “
us
” or “
our
”) is committed to upholding your privacy and respect your rights under the Privacy Act 1974 and other applicable laws.
This Privacy Notice ("Notice") describes how any personally identifiable information (“
PII
”,
“personal information”
) we collect from you or from third parties, including Reward Gateway (the
“administrator”
) who we have entered into a License Agreement with, about you on this website (the “portal”, “
boom! Discounts US
”) will be processed by us.
In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Notice and the terms of the License Agreement, the License Agreement shall prevail.
The Type of Information We Collect From You and How We Use It
We will collect various types of personal information from you when you use boom! Discounts US, depending on the services which you use. Further details of how we use your personal data are set out below.
Before you register
The administrator has provided us with your information for an account to be created.
When you login
Each time you log in to boom! Discounts US, we automatically conduct checks against your Internet Protocol (IP) address to ensure your security. This includes looking up your IP address against a “proxy denylist” to check that someone is not using your credentials and trying to hide their location. This proxy denylist is operated by MaxMind, Inc. If your IP address appears on it, we will not allow you to login.
We also look up the IP address in a static database we download from MaxMind Inc. to check which country the IP is affiliated with. This helps us to further protect your account against people who may have access to your credentials. If we do spot a change, we will alert you and ask you to confirm your login in order to verify your identity before continuing.
This information along with time and event data (such as successful or failed logins) are also recorded in our database for audit purposes.
Depending on the services you use on boom! Discounts US, we may collect and process additional PII about you, as set out below.
When you use Cashback
If you visit a Cashback merchant on boom! Discounts US, we will record that you clicked and visited their website for the purpose of tracking the Cashback earned. We will provide the merchant with a pseudo-anonymous ‘click reference’ to allow us to attribute the purchase and Cashback to you.
If you have a problem with the merchant and your Cashback, we may need to provide them with additional information about your order to help. We will ask you for the minimum information we need to do this, but you will be responsible for the accuracy and level of detail it contains.
Each of these merchants are independent of boom! Discounts US so you should check their privacy terms to make sure you are happy with them before providing any other details to them.
When you withdraw your Cashback
If you make a request for a Cashback withdrawals to your bank account, you will need to provide your bank details for us to process the withdrawal but we will only store your bank details until the withdrawal is processed. They will be shared with our bank, HSBC, to process your request after which all the details will be destroyed.
Alternatively you will be able to withdraw your Cashback as part or full payment for goods on boom! Discounts US or ask us to donate it to the nominated charity on boom! Discounts US.
When you make a debit or credit card purchase
If you choose to purchase goods using a credit or debit card through boom! Discounts US, we will collect your payment details from you and pass them to Checkout.com, our secure payment processor, who will use them to process the payment and to comply with legal requirements. We do not store or process your credit or debit details on our servers.
We will also collect your delivery address from you, and use the contact details previously provided, to allow us to process the order.
If you opt-in to saving your credit or debit details for future use on boom! Discounts US, your personal information will be stored securely by Checkout.com and made available to you for future transactions. You can update or opt-out of saving details for future use at any time.
Where goods are dispatched by a third-party supplier, we may need to share your personal information with them to fulfil your order, such as your contact details and delivery address. This will be clearly indicated to you at the point of purchase. You will be able to review these suppliers’ privacy terms before any information is shared with them.
We will also carry out a fraud check during the order process. This check is carried out by our third party provider, Sift Science (“Sift Science”). Sift Science will only act in accordance with our instructions and how they will process your personal information is set out below.
Sift Science will collect information about your behavior on the portal (such as the length of time between logging in and reaching checkout), technical information about the device used (such as your browser version and IP address) and the details you enter at checkout (such as your contact details and delivery and billing address).
After you have placed your order and before goods are dispatched, Sift Science will use this information to provide us with a score based on the likelihood of fraud. The score provided determines whether your order is automatically accepted by us or queued for our human review. If it is queued for human review, we will carry out a manual fraud check to decide whether to accept or refuse your order or, in some circumstances, require payment to be made by an alternative, more secure mechanism such as a bank transfer. For more information about this processing activity, please contact us using the details provided at the end of this Notice in the “Contacting Us” section.
After too many failed orders
If too many failed orders originate from your account, we will automatically restrict access to your account. Before allowing you to access your account again, we will notify you and ask you for further supporting documents such as your utilities bill or payslip, as evidence that it is you attempting these orders. If these documents are not to our satisfaction, we may contact the administrator with the intention of verifying that it is you using your account in this way.
These supporting documents will only be used for the purpose of verifying your identity, will not be shared with any third parties and will only be retained by us until we have reviewed them, even if we are not satisfied with their legitimacy or authenticity.
You do not need to provide these supporting documents to us but, if you choose not to, then we will not be able to provide you with access to your account.
When you send an eCard or when you make a nomination
If you ask us to send an eCard, you will need to provide us with the name of the person you are sending the eCard to (“the recipient”). If the recipient has already registered on boom! Discounts US, we will send the eCard on your behalf to their registered email address.
If they have not already registered, you will also need to provide an email address which we will send the eCard on your behalf to. The recipient will be asked to confirm that they have read and understood this notice and agree to our Terms & Conditions before being able to view your message.
You must have the consent of the recipient to give us their name and, if applicable, email address and any personal information you disclose in your message to them. This information will also be disclosed to the administrator for the purposes of performance management.
When you complete a survey
If you complete a survey, all of the information that you provide will be provided to the administrator. Please be aware that the administrator controls the survey and what happens to the survey data, which may include using that data for research purposes or making the survey responses public.
We recommend that you contact the administrator to understand how they will use your survey responses. The administrator may decide to provide you with their own separate privacy Notice governing the use of your survey data.

When you use our Service and interact with certain features, you may choose to provide us with additional information such as chats, messages on group threads or discussion boards, comments, likes, and logs for things like your mood, food, or other specified habits.
If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest or promotion, we gather the information you provide such as name, contact info, organization or company name, and message.
Payment and Card Information:
If you give us credit card information, we use it solely to check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.
Information from using our services
Device and Activity Information:
Your fitness tracking device or mobile smartphone collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like your steps, distance traveled and active minutes moved. Not every device tracks every one of these metrics. The data collected varies depending on the device you use. When your device syncs with our applications and software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device or device app to our service.
When you pair your device to your account, you grant us access to your exercise or activity data from that device service. You can use your account settings and tools to withdraw this consent at any time by stopping use of a feature, removing our access to a third-party service, unpairing your device, or deleting your data or your account.
Location Information:
We collect your timezone. This is either gathered from your mobile device, your connected fitness device or is manually set by you. We use timezone to allow challenges to start and end locally at the same time for everyone participating in the challenge. You can change your timezone at any time in your profile settings.
Usage information:
When you access or use our Services, we retain certain usage data. This includes information about your interaction with our Services such as how long you’re in our app or what you’re viewing in our app.
We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access our Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, fitness device type or mobile device information, the referring web page and pages visited.
How we use information
Provide and maintain our services
We use things like your activity information, username, and location to run things like challenges, groups and other core services listed in our Terms & Services. This includes things like scoring your activity in a challenge, populating your dashboard and personal trends, enabling our community features, and providing you with support.
Develop and improve our services
By using our product, you’re constantly helping us to improve! We take a look at what is resonating with most of our users to ensure we can continue to create useful features that you love. We’re always looking to make our existing features better and how you interact with our product helps us decide what improvements should be made.
Communicate with you
We use your information to communicate important service, account or support updates. This allows us to provide relevant information about our product and to respond to you when you contact us. You can always turn off your marketing preferences by unsubscribing at the bottom of emails and by adjusting your app notifications in your profile settings.
Keep our services safe and secure
It’s important that you’re always safe and secure when using our services. We use some of your information to ensure we are only allowing secure usage by authenticating your account details, protecting against fraud and abuse and enforcing our terms and policies.
How we protect your data
We work hard to keep your data safe by implementing appropriate technology safeguards, security policies, and other measures. This includes using a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls, such as suitable access controls, robust physical security measures, and encryption, including Transport Layer Security (TLS), for many of our services. Additionally, we ensure that all employees and others who access or process your data respect your confidentiality. While no method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, if you have any security-related concerns, please contact customer support.
How we share information
When you agree or ask us to share
If you choose to participate in a challenge, information like your profile photo, posted messages, total steps in the challenge, personal statistics, and achievements will be visible to all other challenge participants.
If you sign up for our service through an employer or organization, remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with organizational or employee wellness programs by deleting your personal account or asking your administrator to remove you from the organization account.
MoveSpring does not control the way our organizational clients or admins use our tool. They control the configuration of groups, challenges, content, and communications associated with hosting a wellness program.
Corporate Events
If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by MoveSpring. If this does occur, you will be notified of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Compelled Disclosure
We reserve the right to use or disclose your personal information if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process.
We never sell personal information
We will not sell, rent, transfer, or disclose your personal information to advertisers or other third parties.
