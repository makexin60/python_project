Online Terms and Conditions Generator for Website, Blog, eCommerce Store or App
If you have a
website or software application
, you will likely need to have Terms of Service or as some people call it – Terms of Use for it.
Terms of Service
or Terms and Conditions (T&C) will, in legal terms,
limit your business or personal liability
.
It is highly recommended to have robust and
comprehensive Terms and Conditions
for any website, online business, or application. It will provide you with
proper protection
in case some of your customers or users will decide to take legal action against your business.
The best practice is only to allow using your service to
people that agree with your Terms & Conditions
,
Disclaimer
and
Privacy Policy
. This way, your website, business, or app will be protected from potential legal dangers.
Website Terms of Service (Terms And Conditions / Terms of Use) Generator by PolicyMaker
So now, when you understand the importance of Terms of Use for your website or app, you might be wondering what the
best way to create the Terms and Conditions
for your website is?
There is no simple answer to this question.
As you probably already know, it all depends on your
budget and needs
. Big companies that have in-house lawyers will make their legal team create and periodically update the
Terms of Service
. Companies that do not have legal departments often decide to
outsource this task to professionals
.
As with many other things in life, it comes down to
time and money
. A good professional law firm might do an in-depth evaluation of your situation and craft tailor-made terms and conditions for your business, all done by seasoned professionals.
On the other hand, you might engage with a law firm that will make a fresh out of college intern copy/paste the standard legal templates for you. And, which is quite a common situation these days,
still charge you hefty fees
for their service.
But thousands of website and app owners around the world today choose much more
time and cost-efficient method of
generating legal documents
for their online businesses. They
use
PolicyMaker
to create FREE Terms and Conditions
tailored to their business needs, all done in a few minutes!

All it will take is 3 minutes of your time. And
0 USD in expenses
to get it done!
Terms and Conditions Template by PolicyMaker
Would you agree that many good things have already been done before? Chances are
you did not create your website from scratch
, writing every single line of code. You have probably used
WordPress
,
Wix
,
Shopify
,
Blogger
, or some other platform that has most of the things you need out of the box!
Even if you did create your website or app from ground 0, you have undoubtedly
used some libraries, frameworks, or templates
that made your life easier. Convenient, isn’t it?
We at PolicyMaker help you do the same thing for legal documents. We
continuously monitor the ever-changing landscape of international legislation
that applies to online services and businesses. And we twist, tweak, and always improve our templates so that we can
provide robust legal documentation for you

simple questions about your website
or app, its functionality, and policies. It should take you less than 3 minutes to get it done.

,
NDA agreement
– are made from the universal templates. Our team continually works on
improving and revising
the templates. Still, with limited resources, we can not guarantee that they will be 100% satisfactory for all the jurisdictions and businesses around the world.
If you have any concerns or think that the generated documents might not be the right fit for your business, we
encourage you
to consult with a professional law firm.
Regardless, you can still use PolicyMaker as
it is free and will only take a few minutes of your time
