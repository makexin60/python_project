When you bank with us online or using the NatWest app

We use your info in different ways, like:
Using your health info to help you access our services more easily, like sending statements in braille if you need it
Offering you the right products and services – your info also helps us improve how we serve you
Sharing info about criminal activity with other organisations to stop and detect crime, and to obey laws relating to money laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing
Helping make the bank run smoothly. Thank you.
