Biometric information
In order to verify a user’s identity in connection with a request to cash out, or to confirm that users have not created multiple accounts, we may request access to a user’s mobile camera and require them to take a real-time selfie image of their face. We use a third-party technology installed on Pogo’s servers to analyze the selfie image and, using a combination of machine learning tools and statistical algorithms, generate facial biometric information about the user’s face. We use this information to perform identity verification and confirm that there are not duplicate accounts on the Service.
We may store facial biometric information generated from the images by our third-party software only as long as necessary for fraud detection. We do not use, disclose, or retain facial biometric information for any other commercial purpose.

Biometric information
In order to verify a user’s identity in connection with a request to cash out, or to confirm that users have not created multiple accounts, we may request access to a user’s mobile camera and require them to take a real-time selfie image of their face. We use a third-party technology installed on Pogo’s servers to analyze the selfie image and, using a combination of machine learning tools and statistical algorithms, generate facial biometric information about the user’s face. We use this information to perform identity verification and confirm that there are not duplicate accounts on the Service.
We may store facial biometric information generated from the images by our third-party software only as long as necessary for fraud detection. We do not use, disclose, or retain facial biometric information for any other commercial purpose.
Other information

Biometric information
In order to verify a user’s identity in connection with a request to cash out, or to confirm that users have not created multiple accounts, we may request access to a user’s mobile camera and require them to take a real-time selfie image of their face. We use a third-party technology installed on Pogo’s servers to analyze the selfie image and, using a combination of machine learning tools and statistical algorithms, generate facial biometric information about the user’s face. We use this information to perform identity verification and confirm that there are not duplicate accounts on the Service.
We may store facial biometric information generated from the images by our third-party software only as long as necessary for fraud detection. We do not use, disclose, or retain facial biometric information for any other commercial purpose.
Other information
We may collect additional types of information which we will use in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.
What Personal Information is collected from third-parties?
We also obtain Personal Information from third parties, which we often combine with Personal Information we collect either automatically or directly from you. We may receive the same categories of Personal Information as described above from the types of third parties listed herein.
Information we obtain from social media platforms
We may maintain pages on social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Instagram, and other third-party platforms. When you visit or interact with our pages on those platforms, the platform provider’s privacy policy will apply to your interactions and their collection, use and processing of your Personal Information. You or the platforms may provide us with information through the platform and we will treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information we obtain from Linked Accounts
We may receive your information from Linked Accounts, including Digital Account Data.

Each financial incentive or price or service difference related to the collection and use of personal information is based upon our reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business, taking into consideration the value of the offer itself and the anticipated revenue generation that may be realized by rewarding brand loyalty.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.

child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.

requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about

. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.

Microblink Privacy Policy
1. General
This Privacy Policy details Microblink’s commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who share their personal data with Microblink. It explains how the data is collected, how it is stored, for how long it is retained, what the purposes of processing are, as well as individual rights in relation to such data. Microblink processes personal data following the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data privacy regulations listed in section 1.3.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites and/or services you may encounter using Microblink services. We encourage every user to carefully familiarize themselves with privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing any Microblink service (as defined below) or if you interact with Microblink in any other way.
If you have any privacy related questions, please reach out to our Data Protection Officer at
privacy@microblink.com
.
1.1. About us
Provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to Microblink LLC (Trg Drage Iblera 10, 10000, Zagreb, Republic of Croatia), and its affiliated companies Microblink USA, LLC, (10 Grand Street, STE 2400, Brooklyn, NY 11249, United States of America), Microblink Ltd. (6th Floor, 9 Appold Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2AP), BlinkReceipt, LLC (d/b/a Microblink) (10 Grand St, Suite 2400, Brooklyn, NY 11249, United States of America) and SourcePad INT’L, INC. (25 ADB Avenue, Suite 2701 Discovery Centre Building, Ortigas Center, Pasig City, Philippines), (jointly referred to as “Microblink”).
Microblink can take on different roles when processing personal data. In situations described in Section 2. of this Privacy Policy, Microblink acts as the data controller. Depending on the affiliated company you came into contact with and depending on the nature of this relationship, such a company shall be considered a data controller in that particular case.
When our customers use Microblink products or services to process personal data and this processing is performed on Microblink’s infrastructure, our customers are considered data controllers and Microblink acts as a data processor. Microblink’s data protection obligations towards our customers are governed by appropriate data processing documents that authorize Microblink to process personal data on their behalf and according to their instructions. In addition, these documents ensure that the processing of personal data entrusted to Microblink by our customers is performed securely by prescribing technical and organizational measures, that Data Subject’s rights will be executed by assisting the controller, that the confidentiality of persons authorized to process personal data will be ensured, that only appropriate sub-processors will be engaged, that compliance will be demonstrated and that personal data after the end of the provision of services will be adequately disposed of.
In case a customer purchases a Microblink product that works entirely on-premise, Microblink does not process any personal data and is considered a provider of means of processing.
1.2. Personal data
Within this Privacy Policy, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
1.3. Applicable laws
Given that Microblink is an entity with an international reach and a company with affiliated companies in different jurisdictions, a law that will apply to the processing will depend on which Microblink entity you interacted with. This can be either Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of Section 3 of the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR), Rep. Act no. 10173 and NYS Information Security Breach and Notification Act.
Other privacy laws may also apply depending on the extraterritorial nature of privacy laws applicable to Microblink and its customers. To ensure compliance with different laws, Microblink diligently monitors global data privacy regulations as an integral component of its comprehensive compliance program.
1.4. Lawful basis for processing
The lawful basis we rely on while processing personal data in the context of this Privacy Policy are:
Consent. In some specific situations (as designated below), we may ask you for your consent to process your personal data. If you provide your consent, we will process your data on the basis of such consent. You may withdraw such consent previously granted at any time. However, withdrawing your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on your consent before your withdrawal.
Contract. If you engage with Microblink on a contractual basis, Microblink processes personal data to fulfil our obligations under the contract.
Legitimate interest. We process your personal data on the basis of our prevailing legitimate interest to achieve the purpose of giving you services through our website or communicating with you. If collecting and processing personal data is based on Microblink’s legitimate interest, we give our best efforts to ensure your fundamental rights and freedoms are not overridden by Microblink’s interests or the interests of any third party.
1.5. Security of data
Microblink implements an information security management system to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information assets and protection from threats and vulnerabilities.
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and to maintain data accuracy, as well as to ensure the appropriate use of such data, Microblink utilizes all reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data, including but not limited to minimizing the processing of personal data, pseudonymization, and anonymization of personal data as soon as possible, transparency about the functions and processing of personal data, enabling each individual to have knowledge of the ways and reasons for data processing.
Furthermore, these measures include adequate physical and logical access control, the use of protective technology, and security principles in system acquisition, development and maintenance. All personal data is encrypted while in transit and in storage by using up-to-date industry standards. Microblink is compliant with the ISO 27001:2013 standard, which ensures that information security risks in the company are adequately managed. Additionally, Microblink continuously undertakes and upgrades different measures to ensure the highest standards for data privacy. We design all our processes with special emphasis on protecting personal and confidential data.
Although Microblink takes best industry practice in keeping the data safely stored, Microblink does not warrant that the undertaken safety, technical and organizational measures will be sufficient to fully protect your personal data against potential unauthorized access and use of your personal data. Moreover, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microblink cannot guarantee the safety of your information when in the possession of other parties. However, if such an attempt is detected, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible of a potential breach of the security measures either directly to your contact address, if available, or via an alert notification on the Microblink website and other appropriate channels.
For any questions and reports regarding security, you can reach out to Microblink’s Information Security team via
security@microblink.com
.
1.5.1. Data safety and privacy details for customers
If you use Microblink’s SDK as a component of your app, the page on the
link
will help you disclose privacy and security information to your users.
1.6. Data transfers and sharing the data
The Internet is a global environment and using the Internet to collect and process personal data predominantly involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Any such transfer is made under regulatory requirements that ensure such transfer and/or country maintains the same level of personal data protection. Microblink opted for industry-approved storage providers with the highest privacy and data security standards.
To give you better service and complete support, please note that if you contacted Microblink in relation to a production license of Microblink product(s), Microblink might share your contact details with its partner representing Microblink in your respective territory. Microblink may share information with its affiliates and subsidiaries, its subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the services and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, or the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, following this Privacy Policy. If legally required to do so or when necessary to protect Microblink rights or the rights of third parties, Microblink will disclose information to public authorities, such as law enforcement.
Microblink may implement additional tools or introduce new third-party providers to enhance your user experience and optimise its services and offerings. Microblink will strive to notify of such changes by updating this Privacy Policy in due time. Data collected through the channels described above might be shared with such third parties.
In section 3. Recipients of personal data, you can find additional information on the categories of recipients and purposes of data transfers. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing.
1.6.1. International data transfers
When Microblink transfers personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area, we make sure the recipient offers a similar degree of protection and ensure that one of the following safeguards is in place:
That the data is transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data by the European Commission;
That the transfer is made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or International Data Transfer Agreement approved by Information Commissioner’s Office;
That the appropriate transfer risk assessment has been conducted to determine whether the recipient of the personal data can offer appropriate safeguards.
When transferring data to third countries, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the adequate level of security of your personal data by conducting transfer risk assessments.
1.7. Data retention period
Microblink will retain your personal data as long as it is required to fulfil the purpose of collection or for as long as it is required by the applicable law, a contract or Microblink’s business needs. Upon collection of your personal data, Microblink will disclose for how long it will process your personal data or, if that is not possible, provide criteria for determining that period. Some criteria we use for determining the retention period are categories of personal data processed, the necessity of processing personal data in question to achieve a specific purpose, prevailing legitimate interests of Microblink or any third party, or a legal obligation to retain the data.
If you are unsure how long we process your personal data, feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer via
privacy@microblink.com
.
1.8. Your rights related to the processed data
Each individual has a right to know what data Microblink holds about any such person. The rights every individual has in relation to personal data processed by Microblink are:
Right of access. You have the right to get confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed by Microblink. Where that is the case, you have the right to access your personal data and the following information: the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients or categories of recipients, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period, data subject’s rights, where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source and the existence of automated decision-making.
Right to rectification. You have the right to ask us to correct the personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.
Right to erasure. You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information if it is no longer necessary for the purpose which it was originally collected or processed for, if you withdraw your consent, if you object to the processing of your data, and if there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing or we process your data for direct marketing, if we have processed the personal data unlawfully or we have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.
For more information on how to execute specific requests for deletion of your data in cases when you used Microblink’s apps or DeveloperHub, please visit this
link
.
Right to restriction of the processing. You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information when you think that your personal data we process is inaccurate, that the data has been unlawfully processed, when we no longer need the personal data but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or you have objected to us processing your data, and we are considering whether Microblink’s legitimate grounds override yours.
Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. Keep in mind that in some circumstances, this right is not absolute and that Microblink may not be able to completely delete your personal data from its systems. For example, you can object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing at any time, and after this, we may not process your personal data for this purpose. However, this does not automatically mean that we will erase all personal data we have about you. It is more likely that we will retain just enough information about you to ensure that your preference not to receive direct marketing is respected in future.
Right to data portability. You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information we have about you to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.
Contacting the supervisory authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Additionally, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Microblink for exercising an individual’s rights conferred by the applicable data protection laws.
You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.
For any questions and requests for access or deletion, please email Microblink at
privacy@microblink.com
. It is necessary to clearly state on which basis and through which channel you shared your personal data with Microblink so we can easily fulfil your request. Please note that Microblink may ask for additional information to determine if you are authorized to submit a particular request. If you have a complaint about Microblink’s handling of your data, you can contact the supervisory authority (Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency) to find out more information.
1.9. Do Not Track requests
Your browser or device may include ‘Do Not Track’ functionality. Since these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry or regulators, Microblink’s information collection and disclosure practices, as well as the choices Microblink provides to its website users, Microblink will continue to operate as described in this Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.
1.10. Cookies
For more information on what cookies are, how to manage cookies on this website and the types of cookies we use, please read our Cookie Policy.
1.11. No automated decision-making and profiling
Microblink does not automatically process nor use techniques for profiling its users.
1.12. User content
Microblink practices a zero-tolerance approach to illegal, prohibited, and unethical activities, as well as upload of related content. Please familiarize yourself with the User Content provisions as defined in our Terms of Use. Any and all use of Microblink services must be in compliance with the stated terms.
1.13. Children’s data
Microblink does not knowingly collect information from persons who are considered children by their local law. We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online and mobile activities and interests.
Children below the age of 16 may provide their information only if a parent or guardian has given their consent to do so, in accordance with applicable law. If you have reason to believe that a child below the minimum age has provided personal data to Microblink through using any of the above-stated services without the necessary consent, please contact us at
privacy@microblink.com
, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that data.
1.14. Third-party personal data you share with Microblink
When you send personal data of third parties to Microblink, you are responsible for ensuring an appropriate legal basis for any such sharing of third parties/data subjects. Microblink may ask you to provide evidence that such data is shared on a lawful basis.
Microblink shall use its best efforts to ensure that third parties’ personal data is processed, handled, and collected in the same manner as your own personal data. However, you are solely responsible for obtaining consent from third parties for the use and processing of their personal data.
Additionally, it is your obligation to understand and abide by the applicable local data protection laws when you process and share personal data with Microblink.
1.15. Questions or concerns
Should you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, your privacy as it relates to the use of the services, or the protection of the personal data Microblink holds about you, please contact us via email at
privacy@microblink.com
. We seek to resolve any concerns you may have promptly. You can reach our Data Protection Officer at the same address for any questions or concerns about your data shared with Microblink.
1.16. Changes to the Privacy Policy
Microblink is likely to make changes to its services in the future and, as a consequence, will need to revise this Policy to reflect those changes. You can tell when changes have been made to the Privacy Policy by referring to the “Version” section and “Effective date” at the top of this page. When the Policy is revised, Microblink will post the new Policy on the Microblink website (www.microblink.com), so you should review the page periodically. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the services to stay informed about Microblink privacy practices. Please do not use Microblink services if you do not agree with any of the stipulations contained herein.

Data shared with Microblink by registering on the Microblink Developer Hub is used for setting up and maintaining your registration and to provide features available in Microblink technology as well as to update you on the new services, if you are an existing Microblink user.

2.1.4. Microblink Customer Portal
When purchasing Microblink’s technology through a Microblink Customer Portal, we collect the following personal data about you: first and last name, contact information (email address, phone number), company name, billing and payment information.

We will use your data for the purpose of processing your orders and enabling the use of purchased Microblink technology, to communicate with you regarding your orders, updates, and account-related information to fulfill our contractual obligations. Our sales team may contact you on the basis of your previous relationship as described in section 2.2. of this Privacy Policy.

When requesting access to Microblink’s Trust Center for the purpose of reviewing confidential information located on that portal, visitors will need to provide the following personal data: first and last name, job title, company name, work email, NDA signature time and last login time. Microblink will process this personal data only for the purpose of user access management and protecting its confidential and proprietary information. You can request the deletion of your account and personal data associated with it, but Microblink may need to keep the personal data necessary to identify the individuals and entities bound by the provisions of the NDA to ensure that the agreement is legally binding and enforceable.
2.2. Receiving Microblink’s newsletters and direct marketing
If you provided your email to receive Microblink newsletter, we might have collected personal data contained within such email addresses. Subscribing to the Microblink newsletter is voluntary (based on the consent you have given). Following your subscription, you receive an email through which you can unsubscribe at any time.
When subscribed to our newsletters, you will receive emails with promotional communications, including emails about the products and services offered by Microblink or its partners, and customizing Microblink offerings to you or webinars and other events. For these purposes, such data may be shared with third-party service providers, as described in section 3. Recipients of personal data.
If you are a company representative, keep in mind that we may send you marketing and sales emails on an opt-out basis, but only in the context of the position you hold. This communication can occur without prior consent, and it is based on the previous sale of a product or a service, given that you had the chance to prohibit the use of such information.
2.3. Use of Microblink demo applications
2.3.1. Registration
Some Microblink demo mobile applications may ask you to register before using the application. This way, Microblink might have collected personal data contained within such an email address. Since the demo applications showcase our technology, it is Microblink’s legitimate interest to contact you at the given email address with our product offering. You can object to this processing at any given time.
2.3.2. Sharing of personal data
Please note that not all demo applications store scanned images and that some demo applications process personal data on devices. It is described within each application how the data is processed, what lawful basis is used for processing, whether the images are stored and what the retention period for storing the data is.
If you are trying out Microblink’s technology by using demo mobile applications available on public app stores or by using applications intended for beta testing, depending on the document you are scanning and the component you are trying out, you may be sharing personal data with Microblink.
Microblink uses some mobile demo applications to collect personal data for the purpose of training machine learning systems to enhance the accuracy, performance and functionalities of Microblink products, to improve Microblink technology and add support for new types of documents. If we use an application to collect personal data for this purpose, this will be expressly stated in the privacy notice within the application, and Microblink will ask for the user’s consent for this processing. Such data may be shared with third parties solely for the purpose of developing and testing the technology. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing and described processing, as well as withdraw your consent at any time.
Personal data shared with Microblink using the demo applications may include (depending on the type of document scanned) first and last name, address, date, and place of birth, gender, sex, nationality, country of residence, signature, passport number, social security number, driver’s license number, state or national ID card number, other ID card number, personal identification number, face image, eye colour, weight, height, organ donor status, biometric data or other categories of data found on scanned identity documents.
2.4. Advertising and demand generation
This section of our Privacy Policy explains how Microblink processes data for advertising and demand generation purposes through advertising platforms.
We may collect and process the following types of data for advertising and demand generation: your name, email address, phone number, information about your online activity on our website and related platforms including data such as your IP address, device information, browser type, and browsing behavior, demographic information such as location, and interests to help us target our advertising and demand generation efforts effectively.

Microblink Privacy Policy
1. General
This Privacy Policy details Microblink’s commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who share their personal data with Microblink. It explains how the data is collected, how it is stored, for how long it is retained, what the purposes of processing are, as well as individual rights in relation to such data. Microblink processes personal data following the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data privacy regulations listed in section 1.3.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites and/or services you may encounter using Microblink services. We encourage every user to carefully familiarize themselves with privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing any Microblink service (as defined below) or if you interact with Microblink in any other way.
If you have any privacy related questions, please reach out to our Data Protection Officer at
privacy@microblink.com
.
1.1. About us
Provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to Microblink LLC (Trg Drage Iblera 10, 10000, Zagreb, Republic of Croatia), and its affiliated companies Microblink USA, LLC, (10 Grand Street, STE 2400, Brooklyn, NY 11249, United States of America), Microblink Ltd. (6th Floor, 9 Appold Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2AP), BlinkReceipt, LLC (d/b/a Microblink) (10 Grand St, Suite 2400, Brooklyn, NY 11249, United States of America) and SourcePad INT’L, INC. (25 ADB Avenue, Suite 2701 Discovery Centre Building, Ortigas Center, Pasig City, Philippines), (jointly referred to as “Microblink”).
Microblink can take on different roles when processing personal data. In situations described in Section 2. of this Privacy Policy, Microblink acts as the data controller. Depending on the affiliated company you came into contact with and depending on the nature of this relationship, such a company shall be considered a data controller in that particular case.
When our customers use Microblink products or services to process personal data and this processing is performed on Microblink’s infrastructure, our customers are considered data controllers and Microblink acts as a data processor. Microblink’s data protection obligations towards our customers are governed by appropriate data processing documents that authorize Microblink to process personal data on their behalf and according to their instructions. In addition, these documents ensure that the processing of personal data entrusted to Microblink by our customers is performed securely by prescribing technical and organizational measures, that Data Subject’s rights will be executed by assisting the controller, that the confidentiality of persons authorized to process personal data will be ensured, that only appropriate sub-processors will be engaged, that compliance will be demonstrated and that personal data after the end of the provision of services will be adequately disposed of.
In case a customer purchases a Microblink product that works entirely on-premise, Microblink does not process any personal data and is considered a provider of means of processing.
1.2. Personal data
Within this Privacy Policy, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
1.3. Applicable laws
Given that Microblink is an entity with an international reach and a company with affiliated companies in different jurisdictions, a law that will apply to the processing will depend on which Microblink entity you interacted with. This can be either Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of Section 3 of the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR), Rep. Act no. 10173 and NYS Information Security Breach and Notification Act.
Other privacy laws may also apply depending on the extraterritorial nature of privacy laws applicable to Microblink and its customers. To ensure compliance with different laws, Microblink diligently monitors global data privacy regulations as an integral component of its comprehensive compliance program.
1.4. Lawful basis for processing
The lawful basis we rely on while processing personal data in the context of this Privacy Policy are:
Consent. In some specific situations (as designated below), we may ask you for your consent to process your personal data. If you provide your consent, we will process your data on the basis of such consent. You may withdraw such consent previously granted at any time. However, withdrawing your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on your consent before your withdrawal.
Contract. If you engage with Microblink on a contractual basis, Microblink processes personal data to fulfil our obligations under the contract.
Legitimate interest. We process your personal data on the basis of our prevailing legitimate interest to achieve the purpose of giving you services through our website or communicating with you. If collecting and processing personal data is based on Microblink’s legitimate interest, we give our best efforts to ensure your fundamental rights and freedoms are not overridden by Microblink’s interests or the interests of any third party.
1.5. Security of data
Microblink implements an information security management system to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information assets and protection from threats and vulnerabilities.
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and to maintain data accuracy, as well as to ensure the appropriate use of such data, Microblink utilizes all reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data, including but not limited to minimizing the processing of personal data, pseudonymization, and anonymization of personal data as soon as possible, transparency about the functions and processing of personal data, enabling each individual to have knowledge of the ways and reasons for data processing.
Furthermore, these measures include adequate physical and logical access control, the use of protective technology, and security principles in system acquisition, development and maintenance. All personal data is encrypted while in transit and in storage by using up-to-date industry standards. Microblink is compliant with the ISO 27001:2013 standard, which ensures that information security risks in the company are adequately managed. Additionally, Microblink continuously undertakes and upgrades different measures to ensure the highest standards for data privacy. We design all our processes with special emphasis on protecting personal and confidential data.
Although Microblink takes best industry practice in keeping the data safely stored, Microblink does not warrant that the undertaken safety, technical and organizational measures will be sufficient to fully protect your personal data against potential unauthorized access and use of your personal data. Moreover, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microblink cannot guarantee the safety of your information when in the possession of other parties. However, if such an attempt is detected, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible of a potential breach of the security measures either directly to your contact address, if available, or via an alert notification on the Microblink website and other appropriate channels.
For any questions and reports regarding security, you can reach out to Microblink’s Information Security team via
security@microblink.com
.
1.5.1. Data safety and privacy details for customers
If you use Microblink’s SDK as a component of your app, the page on the
link
will help you disclose privacy and security information to your users.
1.6. Data transfers and sharing the data
The Internet is a global environment and using the Internet to collect and process personal data predominantly involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Any such transfer is made under regulatory requirements that ensure such transfer and/or country maintains the same level of personal data protection. Microblink opted for industry-approved storage providers with the highest privacy and data security standards.
To give you better service and complete support, please note that if you contacted Microblink in relation to a production license of Microblink product(s), Microblink might share your contact details with its partner representing Microblink in your respective territory. Microblink may share information with its affiliates and subsidiaries, its subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the services and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, or the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, following this Privacy Policy. If legally required to do so or when necessary to protect Microblink rights or the rights of third parties, Microblink will disclose information to public authorities, such as law enforcement.
Microblink may implement additional tools or introduce new third-party providers to enhance your user experience and optimise its services and offerings. Microblink will strive to notify of such changes by updating this Privacy Policy in due time. Data collected through the channels described above might be shared with such third parties.
In section 3. Recipients of personal data, you can find additional information on the categories of recipients and purposes of data transfers. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing.
1.6.1. International data transfers
When Microblink transfers personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area, we make sure the recipient offers a similar degree of protection and ensure that one of the following safeguards is in place:
That the data is transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data by the European Commission;
That the transfer is made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or International Data Transfer Agreement approved by Information Commissioner’s Office;
That the appropriate transfer risk assessment has been conducted to determine whether the recipient of the personal data can offer appropriate safeguards.
When transferring data to third countries, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the adequate level of security of your personal data by conducting transfer risk assessments.
1.7. Data retention period
Microblink will retain your personal data as long as it is required to fulfil the purpose of collection or for as long as it is required by the applicable law, a contract or Microblink’s business needs. Upon collection of your personal data, Microblink will disclose for how long it will process your personal data or, if that is not possible, provide criteria for determining that period. Some criteria we use for determining the retention period are categories of personal data processed, the necessity of processing personal data in question to achieve a specific purpose, prevailing legitimate interests of Microblink or any third party, or a legal obligation to retain the data.
If you are unsure how long we process your personal data, feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer via
privacy@microblink.com
.
1.8. Your rights related to the processed data
Each individual has a right to know what data Microblink holds about any such person. The rights every individual has in relation to personal data processed by Microblink are:
Right of access. You have the right to get confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed by Microblink. Where that is the case, you have the right to access your personal data and the following information: the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients or categories of recipients, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period, data subject’s rights, where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source and the existence of automated decision-making.
Right to rectification. You have the right to ask us to correct the personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.
Right to erasure. You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information if it is no longer necessary for the purpose which it was originally collected or processed for, if you withdraw your consent, if you object to the processing of your data, and if there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing or we process your data for direct marketing, if we have processed the personal data unlawfully or we have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.
For more information on how to execute specific requests for deletion of your data in cases when you used Microblink’s apps or DeveloperHub, please visit this
link
.
Right to restriction of the processing. You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information when you think that your personal data we process is inaccurate, that the data has been unlawfully processed, when we no longer need the personal data but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or you have objected to us processing your data, and we are considering whether Microblink’s legitimate grounds override yours.
Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. Keep in mind that in some circumstances, this right is not absolute and that Microblink may not be able to completely delete your personal data from its systems. For example, you can object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing at any time, and after this, we may not process your personal data for this purpose. However, this does not automatically mean that we will erase all personal data we have about you. It is more likely that we will retain just enough information about you to ensure that your preference not to receive direct marketing is respected in future.
Right to data portability. You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information we have about you to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.
Contacting the supervisory authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Additionally, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Microblink for exercising an individual’s rights conferred by the applicable data protection laws.
You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.
For any questions and requests for access or deletion, please email Microblink at
privacy@microblink.com
. It is necessary to clearly state on which basis and through which channel you shared your personal data with Microblink so we can easily fulfil your request. Please note that Microblink may ask for additional information to determine if you are authorized to submit a particular request. If you have a complaint about Microblink’s handling of your data, you can contact the supervisory authority (Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency) to find out more information.
1.9. Do Not Track requests
Your browser or device may include ‘Do Not Track’ functionality. Since these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry or regulators, Microblink’s information collection and disclosure practices, as well as the choices Microblink provides to its website users, Microblink will continue to operate as described in this Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.

Microblink uses some mobile demo applications to collect personal data for the purpose of training machine learning systems to enhance the accuracy, performance and functionalities of Microblink products, to improve Microblink technology and add support for new types of documents. If we use an application to collect personal data for this purpose, this will be expressly stated in the privacy notice within the application, and Microblink will ask for the user’s consent for this processing. Such data may be shared with third parties solely for the purpose of developing and testing the technology. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing and described processing, as well as withdraw your consent at any time.
Personal data shared with Microblink using the demo applications may include (depending on the type of document scanned) first and last name, address, date, and place of birth, gender, sex, nationality, country of residence, signature, passport number, social security number, driver’s license number, state or national ID card number, other ID card number, personal identification number, face image, eye colour, weight, height, organ donor status, biometric data or other categories of data found on scanned identity documents.

An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
1.3. Applicable laws
Given that Microblink is an entity with an international reach and a company with affiliated companies in different jurisdictions, a law that will apply to the processing will depend on which Microblink entity you interacted with. This can be either Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of Section 3 of the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR), Rep. Act no. 10173 and NYS Information Security Breach and Notification Act.
Other privacy laws may also apply depending on the extraterritorial nature of privacy laws applicable to Microblink and its customers. To ensure compliance with different laws, Microblink diligently monitors global data privacy regulations as an integral component of its comprehensive compliance program.
1.4. Lawful basis for processing
The lawful basis we rely on while processing personal data in the context of this Privacy Policy are:
Consent. In some specific situations (as designated below), we may ask you for your consent to process your personal data. If you provide your consent, we will process your data on the basis of such consent. You may withdraw such consent previously granted at any time. However, withdrawing your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on your consent before your withdrawal.
Contract. If you engage with Microblink on a contractual basis, Microblink processes personal data to fulfil our obligations under the contract.
Legitimate interest. We process your personal data on the basis of our prevailing legitimate interest to achieve the purpose of giving you services through our website or communicating with you. If collecting and processing personal data is based on Microblink’s legitimate interest, we give our best efforts to ensure your fundamental rights and freedoms are not overridden by Microblink’s interests or the interests of any third party.
1.5. Security of data
Microblink implements an information security management system to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information assets and protection from threats and vulnerabilities.
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and to maintain data accuracy, as well as to ensure the appropriate use of such data, Microblink utilizes all reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data, including but not limited to minimizing the processing of personal data, pseudonymization, and anonymization of personal data as soon as possible, transparency about the functions and processing of personal data, enabling each individual to have knowledge of the ways and reasons for data processing.
Furthermore, these measures include adequate physical and logical access control, the use of protective technology, and security principles in system acquisition, development and maintenance. All personal data is encrypted while in transit and in storage by using up-to-date industry standards. Microblink is compliant with the ISO 27001:2013 standard, which ensures that information security risks in the company are adequately managed. Additionally, Microblink continuously undertakes and upgrades different measures to ensure the highest standards for data privacy. We design all our processes with special emphasis on protecting personal and confidential data.
Although Microblink takes best industry practice in keeping the data safely stored, Microblink does not warrant that the undertaken safety, technical and organizational measures will be sufficient to fully protect your personal data against potential unauthorized access and use of your personal data. Moreover, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microblink cannot guarantee the safety of your information when in the possession of other parties. However, if such an attempt is detected, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible of a potential breach of the security measures either directly to your contact address, if available, or via an alert notification on the Microblink website and other appropriate channels.
For any questions and reports regarding security, you can reach out to Microblink’s Information Security team via
security@microblink.com
.
1.6. Data transfers and sharing the data
The Internet is a global environment and using the Internet to collect and process personal data predominantly involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Any such transfer is made under regulatory requirements that ensure such transfer and/or country maintains the same level of personal data protection. Microblink opted for industry-approved storage providers with the highest privacy and data security standards.
To give you better service and complete support, please note that if you contacted Microblink in relation to a production license of Microblink product(s), Microblink might share your contact details with its partner representing Microblink in your respective territory. Microblink may share information with its affiliates and subsidiaries, its subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the services and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, or the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, following this Privacy Policy. If legally required to do so or when necessary to protect Microblink rights or the rights of third parties, Microblink will disclose information to public authorities, such as law enforcement.
Microblink may implement additional tools or introduce new third-party providers to enhance your user experience and optimise its services and offerings. Microblink will strive to notify of such changes by updating this Privacy Policy in due time. Data collected through the channels described above might be shared with such third parties.
In section 3. Recipients of personal data, you can find additional information on the categories of recipients and purposes of data transfers. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing.
1.6.1. International data transfers
When Microblink transfers personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area, we make sure the recipient offers a similar degree of protection and ensure that one of the following safeguards is in place:
That the data is transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data by the European Commission;
That the transfer is made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or International Data Transfer Agreement approved by Information Commissioner’s Office;
That the appropriate transfer risk assessment has been conducted to determine whether the recipient of the personal data can offer appropriate safeguards.
When transferring data to third countries, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the adequate level of security of your personal data by conducting transfer risk assessments.
1.7. Data retention period
Microblink will retain your personal data as long as it is required to fulfil the purpose of collection or for as long as it is required by the applicable law, a contract or Microblink’s business needs. Upon collection of your personal data, Microblink will disclose for how long it will process your personal data or, if that is not possible, provide criteria for determining that period. Some criteria we use for determining the retention period are categories of personal data processed, the necessity of processing personal data in question to achieve a specific purpose, prevailing legitimate interests of Microblink or any third party, or a legal obligation to retain the data.
If you are unsure how long we process your personal data, feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer via
privacy@microblink.com
.
1.8. Your rights related to the processed data
Each individual has a right to know what data Microblink holds about any such person. The rights every individual has in relation to personal data processed by Microblink are:
Right of access. You have the right to get confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed by Microblink. Where that is the case, you have the right to access your personal data and the following information: the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients or categories of recipients, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period, data subject’s rights, where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source and the existence of automated decision-making.
Right to rectification. You have the right to ask us to correct the personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.
Right to erasure. You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information if it is no longer necessary for the purpose which it was originally collected or processed for, if you withdraw your consent, if you object to the processing of your data, and if there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing or we process your data for direct marketing, if we have processed the personal data unlawfully or we have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.
Right to restriction of the processing. You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information when you think that your personal data we process is inaccurate, that the data has been unlawfully processed, when we no longer need the personal data but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or you have objected to us processing your data, and we are considering whether Microblink’s legitimate grounds override yours.
Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. Keep in mind that in some circumstances, this right is not absolute and that Microblink may not be able to completely delete your personal data from its systems. For example, you can object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing at any time, and after this, we may not process your personal data for this purpose. However, this does not automatically mean that we will erase all personal data we have about you. It is more likely that we will retain just enough information about you to ensure that your preference not to receive direct marketing is respected in future.
Right to data portability. You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information we have about you to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.
Contacting the supervisory authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Additionally, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Microblink for exercising an individual’s rights conferred by the applicable data protection laws.
You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.
For any questions and requests for access or deletion, please email Microblink at
privacy@microblink.com
. It is necessary to clearly state on which basis and through which channel you shared your personal data with Microblink so we can easily fulfil your request. Please note that Microblink may ask for additional information to determine if you are authorized to submit a particular request. If you have a complaint about Microblink’s handling of your data, you can contact the supervisory authority (Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency) to find out more information.

1.1. About us
Provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to Microblink LLC (Trg Drage Iblera 10, 10000, Zagreb, Republic of Croatia), and its affiliated companies Microblink Ltd. (6th Floor, 9 Appold Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2AP), BlinkReceipt, LLC (d/b/a Microblink) (10 Grand St, Suite 2400, Brooklyn, NY 11249, United States of America) and SourcePad INT’L, INC. (25 ADB Avenue, Suite 2701 Discovery Centre Building, Ortigas Center, Pasig City, Philippines), (jointly referred to as “Microblink”).
Microblink can take on different roles when processing personal data. In situations described in Section 2. of this Privacy Policy, Microblink acts as the data controller. Depending on the affiliated company you came into contact with and depending on the nature of this relationship, such a company shall be considered a data controller in that particular case.
When our customers use Microblink products or services to process personal data and this processing is performed on Microblink’s infrastructure, our customers are considered data controllers and Microblink acts as a data processor. Microblink’s data protection obligations towards our customers are governed by appropriate data processing documents that authorize Microblink to process personal data on their behalf and according to their instructions. In addition, these documents ensure that the processing of personal data entrusted to Microblink by our customers is performed securely by prescribing technical and organizational measures, that Data Subject’s rights will be executed by assisting the controller, that the confidentiality of persons authorized to process personal data will be ensured, that only appropriate sub-processors will be engaged, that compliance will be demonstrated and that personal data after the end of the provision of services will be adequately disposed of.
In case a customer purchases a Microblink product that works entirely on-premise, Microblink does not process any personal data and is considered a provider of means of processing.
1.2. Personal data
Within this Privacy Policy, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
1.3. Applicable laws
Given that Microblink is an entity with an international reach and a company with affiliated companies in different jurisdictions, a law that will apply to the processing will depend on which Microblink entity you interacted with.

If legally required to do so or when necessary to protect Microblink rights or the rights of third parties, Microblink will disclose information to public authorities, such as law enforcement.
Microblink may implement additional tools or introduce new third-party providers to enhance your user experience and optimise its services and offerings.

When transferring data to third countries, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the adequate level of security of your personal data by conducting transfer risk assessments.
1.7. Data retention period
Microblink will retain your personal data as long as it is required to fulfil the purpose of collection or for as long as it is required by the applicable law, a contract or Microblink’s business needs. Upon collection of your personal data, Microblink will disclose for how long it will process your personal data or, if that is not possible, provide criteria for determining that period. Some criteria we use for determining the retention period are categories of personal data processed, the necessity of processing personal data in question to achieve a specific purpose, prevailing legitimate interests of Microblink or any third party, or a legal obligation to retain the data.

1.8. Your rights related to the processed data
Each individual has a right to know what data Microblink holds about any such person. The rights every individual has in relation to personal data processed by Microblink are:
Right of access. You have the right to get confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed by Microblink. Where that is the case, you have the right to access your personal data and the following information: the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients or categories of recipients, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period, data subject’s rights, where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source and the existence of automated decision-making.
Right to rectification. You have the right to ask us to correct the personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.
Right to erasure. You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information if it is no longer necessary for the purpose which it was originally collected or processed for, if you withdraw your consent, if you object to the processing of your data, and if there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing or we process your data for direct marketing, if we have processed the personal data unlawfully or we have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.
Right to restriction of the processing. You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information when you think that your personal data we process is inaccurate, that the data has been unlawfully processed, when we no longer need the personal data but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or you have objected to us processing your data, and we are considering whether Microblink’s legitimate grounds override yours.
Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. Keep in mind that in some circumstances, this right is not absolute and that Microblink may not be able to completely delete your personal data from its systems. For example, you can object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing at any time, and after this, we may not process your personal data for this purpose. However, this does not automatically mean that we will erase all personal data we have about you. It is more likely that we will retain just enough information about you to ensure that your preference not to receive direct marketing is respected in future.
Right to data portability. You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information we have about you to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.
Contacting the supervisory authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

Privacy Policy
1. General
This Privacy Policy details Microblink’s commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who share their personal data with Microblink. It explains how the data is collected, how it is stored, for how long it is retained, what the purposes of processing are, as well as individual rights in relation to such data. Microblink processes personal data following the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data privacy regulations listed in section 1.3.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites and/or services you may encounter using Microblink services. We encourage every user to carefully familiarize themselves with privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing any Microblink service (as defined below) or if you interact with Microblink in any other way.
If you have any privacy related questions, please reach out to our Data Protection Officer at
privacy@microblink.com
.
1.1. About us
Provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to Microblink LLC (Trg Drage Iblera 10, 10000, Zagreb, Republic of Croatia), and its affiliated companies Microblink Ltd. (6th Floor, 9 Appold Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2AP), BlinkReceipt, LLC (d/b/a Microblink) (10 Grand St, Suite 2400, Brooklyn, NY 11249, United States of America) and SourcePad INT’L, INC. (25 ADB Avenue, Suite 2701 Discovery Centre Building, Ortigas Center, Pasig City, Philippines), (jointly referred to as “Microblink”).
Microblink can take on different roles when processing personal data. In situations described in Section 2. of this Privacy Policy, Microblink acts as the data controller. Depending on the affiliated company you came into contact with and depending on the nature of this relationship, such a company shall be considered a data controller in that particular case.
When our customers use Microblink products or services to process personal data and this processing is performed on Microblink’s infrastructure, our customers are considered data controllers and Microblink acts as a data processor. Microblink’s data protection obligations towards our customers are governed by appropriate data processing documents that authorize Microblink to process personal data on their behalf and according to their instructions. In addition, these documents ensure that the processing of personal data entrusted to Microblink by our customers is performed securely by prescribing technical and organizational measures, that Data Subject’s rights will be executed by assisting the controller, that the confidentiality of persons authorized to process personal data will be ensured, that only appropriate sub-processors will be engaged, that compliance will be demonstrated and that personal data after the end of the provision of services will be adequately disposed of.
In case a customer purchases a Microblink product that works entirely on-premise, Microblink does not process any personal data and is considered a provider of means of processing.
1.2. Personal data
Within this Privacy Policy, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
1.3. Applicable laws
Given that Microblink is an entity with an international reach and a company with affiliated companies in different jurisdictions, a law that will apply to the processing will depend on which Microblink entity you interacted with. This can be either Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of Section 3 of the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR), Rep. Act no. 10173 and NYS Information Security Breach and Notification Act.
Other privacy laws may also apply depending on the extraterritorial nature of privacy laws applicable to Microblink and its customers. To ensure compliance with different laws, Microblink diligently monitors global data privacy regulations as an integral component of its comprehensive compliance program.
1.4. Lawful basis for processing
The lawful basis we rely on while processing personal data in the context of this Privacy Policy are:
Consent. In some specific situations (as designated below), we may ask you for your consent to process your personal data. If you provide your consent, we will process your data on the basis of such consent. You may withdraw such consent previously granted at any time. However, withdrawing your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on your consent before your withdrawal.
Contract. If you engage with Microblink on a contractual basis, Microblink processes personal data to fulfil our obligations under the contract.
Legitimate interest. We process your personal data on the basis of our prevailing legitimate interest to achieve the purpose of giving you services through our website or communicating with you. If collecting and processing personal data is based on Microblink’s legitimate interest, we give our best efforts to ensure your fundamental rights and freedoms are not overridden by Microblink’s interests or the interests of any third party.
1.5. Security of data
Microblink implements an information security management system to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information assets and protection from threats and vulnerabilities.
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and to maintain data accuracy, as well as to ensure the appropriate use of such data, Microblink utilizes all reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data, including but not limited to minimizing the processing of personal data, pseudonymization, and anonymization of personal data as soon as possible, transparency about the functions and processing of personal data, enabling each individual to have knowledge of the ways and reasons for data processing.
Furthermore, these measures include adequate physical and logical access control, the use of protective technology, and security principles in system acquisition, development and maintenance. All personal data is encrypted while in transit and in storage by using up-to-date industry standards. Microblink is compliant with the ISO 27001:2013 standard, which ensures that information security risks in the company are adequately managed. Additionally, Microblink continuously undertakes and upgrades different measures to ensure the highest standards for data privacy. We design all our processes with special emphasis on protecting personal and confidential data.
Although Microblink takes best industry practice in keeping the data safely stored, Microblink does not warrant that the undertaken safety, technical and organizational measures will be sufficient to fully protect your personal data against potential unauthorized access and use of your personal data. Moreover, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microblink cannot guarantee the safety of your information when in the possession of other parties. However, if such an attempt is detected, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible of a potential breach of the security measures either directly to your contact address, if available, or via an alert notification on the Microblink website and other appropriate channels.
For any questions and reports regarding security, you can reach out to Microblink’s Information Security team via
security@microblink.com
.
1.6. Data transfers and sharing the data
The Internet is a global environment and using the Internet to collect and process personal data predominantly involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Any such transfer is made under regulatory requirements that ensure such transfer and/or country maintains the same level of personal data protection. Microblink opted for industry-approved storage providers with the highest privacy and data security standards.
To give you better service and complete support, please note that if you contacted Microblink in relation to a production license of Microblink product(s), Microblink might share your contact details with its partner representing Microblink in your respective territory. Microblink may share information with its affiliates and subsidiaries, its subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the services and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, or the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, following this Privacy Policy. If legally required to do so or when necessary to protect Microblink rights or the rights of third parties, Microblink will disclose information to public authorities, such as law enforcement.
Microblink may implement additional tools or introduce new third-party providers to enhance your user experience and optimise its services and offerings. Microblink will strive to notify of such changes by updating this Privacy Policy in due time. Data collected through the channels described above might be shared with such third parties.
In section 3. Recipients of personal data, you can find additional information on the categories of recipients and purposes of data transfers. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing.
1.6.1. International data transfers
When Microblink transfers personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area, we make sure the recipient offers a similar degree of protection and ensure that one of the following safeguards is in place:
That the data is transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data by the European Commission;
That the transfer is made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or International Data Transfer Agreement approved by Information Commissioner’s Office;
That the appropriate transfer risk assessment has been conducted to determine whether the recipient of the personal data can offer appropriate safeguards.
When transferring data to third countries, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the adequate level of security of your personal data by conducting transfer risk assessments.
1.7. Data retention period
Microblink will retain your personal data as long as it is required to fulfil the purpose of collection or for as long as it is required by the applicable law, a contract or Microblink’s business needs. Upon collection of your personal data, Microblink will disclose for how long it will process your personal data or, if that is not possible, provide criteria for determining that period. Some criteria we use for determining the retention period are categories of personal data processed, the necessity of processing personal data in question to achieve a specific purpose, prevailing legitimate interests of Microblink or any third party, or a legal obligation to retain the data.
If you are unsure how long we process your personal data, feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer via
privacy@microblink.com

If you are trying out Microblink’s technology by using demo mobile applications available on public app stores or by using applications intended for beta testing, depending on the document you are scanning and the component you are trying out, you may be sharing personal data with Microblink.
Microblink uses some mobile demo applications to collect personal data for the purpose of training machine learning systems to enhance the accuracy, performance and functionalities of Microblink products, to improve Microblink technology and add support for new types of documents. If we use an application to collect personal data for this purpose, this will be expressly stated in the privacy notice within the application, and Microblink will ask for the user’s consent for this processing. Such data may be shared with third parties solely for the purpose of developing and testing the technology. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing and described processing, as well as withdraw your consent at any time.
Personal data shared with Microblink using the demo applications may include (depending on the type of document scanned) first and last name, address, date, and place of birth, gender, sex, nationality, country of residence, signature, passport number, social security number, driver’s license number, state or national ID card number, other ID card number, personal identification number, face image, eye colour, weight, height, organ donor status, biometric data or other categories of data found on scanned identity documents.

Privacy Policy
Latest Update:
February 2023
1. General
This Privacy Policy details Microblink’s commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who share their personal data with Microblink. It explains how the data is collected, how it is stored, for how long it is retained, what the purposes of processing are, as well as individual rights in relation to such data. Microblink processes personal data following the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data privacy regulations.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites and/or services you may encounter using Microblink services. We encourage every user to carefully familiarise themselves with privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties.
Please read it carefully before accessing any Microblink service (as defined below) or if you interact with Microblink in any other way.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please email us at
privacy@microblink.com
.
1.1. About us
Provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to Microblink LLC (Trg Drage Iblera 10, 10000, Zagreb), and its affiliated companies Microblink Ltd. (6th Floor, 9 Appold Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2AP), BlinkReceipt, LLC (d/b/a Microblink) (10 Grand St, Suite 2400, Brooklyn, NY 11249, United States of America) and SourcePad INT’L, INC. (25 ADB Avenue, Suite 2701 Discovery Centre Building, Ortigas Center, Pasig City), (referred to as “Microblink”).
This Privacy Policy details Microblink’s commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who share their personal data with Microblink. In all situations described in this Privacy Policy, Microblink acts as the data controller. Depending on the affiliated company you came into contact with and under what circumstances, such a company shall be considered a data controller in that particular case.
1.2. Personal data
Within this Privacy Policy, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
1.3. Applicable law
Given that Microblink is an entity with an international reach and a company with affiliated companies in different jurisdictions, a law that will apply to the processing will depend on which Microblink entity you interacted with. This can be either Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of Section 3 of the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR), Rep. Act no. 10173 and NYS Information Security Breach and Notification Act. Other privacy laws may also apply depending on extraterritorial natute od privacy laws.
1.4. Lawful basis for processing
The lawful basis we rely on while processing personal data in the context of this Privacy Policy are:
Consent. In some specific situations (as designated below), we may ask you for your consent to process your personal data. If you provide your consent, we will process your data on the basis of such consent. You may withdraw such consent previously granted at any time. However, withdrawing your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on your consent before your withdrawal.
Contract. If you engage with Microblink on a contractual basis, Microblink processes personal data to fulfil our obligations under the contract.
Legitimate interest. We process your personal data on the basis of our prevailing legitimate interest to achieve the purpose of giving you services through our website or communicating with you. If collecting and processing personal data is based on Microblink’s legitimate interest, we give our best efforts to ensure your fundamental rights and freedoms are not overridden by Microblink’s interests or the interests of any third party.
1.5. Security of your data
Microblink implements an information security management system to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information assets and protection from threats and vulnerabilities.
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and to maintain data accuracy, as well as to ensure the appropriate use of such data, Microblink utilizes all reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data, including but not limited to minimizing the processing of personal data, pseudonymization, and anonymization of personal data as soon as possible, transparency about the functions and processing of personal data, enabling each individual to have knowledge of the ways and reasons for data processing.
Furthermore, these measures include adequate physical and logical access control, the use of protective technology, and security principles in system acquisition, development and maintenance. All personal data is encrypted while in transit and in storage by using up-to-date industry standards. Microblink is compliant with the ISO 27001:2013 standard, which ensures that information security risks in the company are adequately managed. Additionally, Microblink continuously undertakes and upgrades different measures to ensure the highest standards for data privacy. We design all our processes with special emphasis on protecting personal and confidential data.
Although Microblink takes best industry practice in keeping the data safely stored, Microblink does not warrant that the undertaken safety, technical and organizational measures will be sufficient to fully protect your personal data against potential unauthorized access and use of your personal data. Moreover, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microblink cannot guarantee the safety of your information when in the possession of other parties. However, if such an attempt is detected, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible of a potential breach of the security measures either directly to your contact address, if available, or via an alert notification on the Microblink website and other appropriate channels.
For any questions and reports regarding security, you can reach out to Microblink’s Information Security team via
security@microblink.com
.
1.6. Data transfers and sharing the data
The Internet is a global environment and using the Internet to collect and process personal data predominantly involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Any such transfer is made under regulatory requirements that ensure such transfer and/or country maintains the same level of personal data protection. Microblink opted for industry-approved storage providers with the highest privacy and data security standards.
To give you better service and complete support, please note that if you contacted Microblink in relation to a production license of Microblink product(s), Microblink might share your contact details with its partner representing Microblink in your respective territory. Microblink may share information with its affiliates and subsidiaries, its subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the services and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, or the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, following this Privacy Policy. If legally required to do so or when necessary to protect Microblink rights or the rights of third parties, Microblink will disclose information to public authorities, such as law enforcement.
Microblink may implement additional tools or introduce new third-party providers to enhance your user experience and optimise its services and offerings. Microblink will strive to notify of such changes by updating this Privacy Policy in due time. Data collected through the channels described above might be shared with such third parties.
In section 3. Recipients of personal data, you can find additional information on the categories of recipients and purposes of data transfers. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing.
1.6.1. International data transfers
When Microblink transfers personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area, we make sure the recipient offers a similar degree of protection and ensure that one of the following safeguards is in place:
That the data is transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data by the European Commission;
That the transfer is made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or International Data Transfer Agreement approved by Information Commissioner’s Office;
That the appropriate transfer risk assessment has been conducted to determine whether the recipient of the personal data can offer appropriate safeguards.
When transferring data to third countries, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the adequate level of security of your personal data by conducting transfer risk assessments.
1.7. Data retention period
Microblink will retain your personal data as long as it is required to fulfil the purpose of collection or for as long as it is required by the applicable law, a contract or Microblink’s business needs. Upon collection of your personal data, Microblink will disclose for how long it will process your personal data or, if that is not possible, provide criteria for determining that period. Some criteria we use for determining the retention period are categories of personal data processed, the necessity of processing personal data in question to achieve a specific purpose, prevailing legitimate interests of Microblink or any third party, or a legal obligation to retain the data.
If you are unsure how long we process your personal data, feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer via
privacy@microblink.com
.
1.8. Your rights related to the processed data
Each individual has a right to know what data Microblink holds about any such person. The rights every individual has in relation to personal data processed by Microblink are:
Right of access. You have the right to get confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed by Microblink. Where that is the case, you have the right to access your personal data and the following information: the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients or categories of recipients, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period, data subject’s rights, where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source and the existence of automated decision-making.
Right to rectification. You have the right to ask us to correct the personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.
Right to erasure. You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information if it is no longer necessary for the purpose which it was originally collected or processed for, if you withdraw your consent, if you object to the processing of your data, and if there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing or we process your data for direct marketing, if we have processed the personal data unlawfully or we have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.
Right to restriction of the processing. You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information when you think that your personal data we process is inaccurate, that the data has been unlawfully processed, when we no longer need the personal data but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or you have objected to us processing your data, and we are considering whether Microblink’s legitimate grounds override yours.
Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. Keep in mind that in some circumstances, this right is not absolute and that Microblink may not be able to completely delete your personal data from its systems. For example, you can object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing at any time, and after this, we may not process your personal data for this purpose. However, this does not automatically mean that we will erase all personal data we have about you. It is more likely that we will retain just enough information about you to ensure that your preference not to receive direct marketing is respected in future.
Right to data portability. You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information we have about you to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.
Contacting the supervisory authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Additionally, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Microblink for exercising an individual’s rights conferred by the applicable data protection laws.
You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.
For any questions and requests for access or deletion, please email Microblink at
privacy@microblink.com
. It is necessary to clearly state on which basis and through which channel you shared your personal data with Microblink so we can easily fulfil your request. Please note that Microblink may ask for additional information to determine if you are authorized to submit a particular request.

Since these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry or regulators, Microblink’s information collection and disclosure practices, as well as the choices Microblink provides to its website users, Microblink will continue to operate as described in this Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.
1.10. Cookies

Contract. If you engage with Microblink on a contractual basis, Microblink processes personal data to fulfil our obligations under the contract.
Legitimate interest. We process your personal data on the basis of our prevailing legitimate interest to achieve the purpose of giving you services through our website or communicating with you.

1.4. Security of your data
Microblink implements an information security management system to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information assets and protection from threats and vulnerabilities.
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and to maintain data accuracy, as well as to ensure the appropriate use of such data, Microblink utilizes all reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data, including but not limited to minimizing the processing of personal data, pseudonymization, and anonymization of personal data as soon as possible, transparency about the functions and processing of personal data, enabling each individual to have knowledge of the ways and reasons for data processing.
Furthermore, these measures include adequate physical and logical access control, the use of protective technology, and security principles in system acquisition, development and maintenance. All personal data is encrypted while in transit and in storage by using up-to-date industry standards. Microblink is compliant with the ISO 27001:2013 standard, which ensures that information security risks in the company are adequately managed. Additionally, Microblink continuously undertakes and upgrades different measures to ensure the highest standards for data privacy. We design all our processes with special emphasis on protecting personal and confidential data.
Although Microblink takes best industry practice in keeping the data safely stored, Microblink does not warrant that the undertaken safety, technical and organizational measures will be sufficient to fully protect your personal data against potential unauthorized access and use of your personal data. Moreover, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microblink cannot guarantee the safety of your information when in the possession of other parties. However, if such an attempt is detected, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible of a potential breach of the security measures either directly to your contact address, if available, or via an alert notification on the Microblink website and other appropriate channels.
For any questions and reports regarding security, you can reach out to Microblink’s Information Security team via

1.5. Data transfers and sharing the data
The Internet is a global environment and using the Internet to collect and process personal data predominantly involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Any such transfer is made under regulatory requirements that ensure such transfer and/or country maintains the same level of personal data protection. Microblink opted for industry-approved storage providers with the highest privacy and data security standards.
To give you better service and complete support, please note that if you contacted Microblink in relation to a production license of Microblink product(s), Microblink might share your contact details with its partner representing Microblink in your respective territory. Microblink may share information with its affiliates and subsidiaries, its subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the services and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, or the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, following this Privacy Policy. If legally required to do so or when necessary to protect Microblink rights or the rights of third parties, Microblink will disclose information to public authorities, such as law enforcement.
Microblink may implement additional tools or introduce new third-party providers to enhance your user experience and optimise its services and offerings. Microblink will strive to notify of such changes by updating this Privacy Policy in due time. Data collected through the channels described above might be shared with such third parties.
In section 3. Recipients of personal data, you can find additional information on the categories of recipients and purposes of data transfers. You can contact Microblink at any time to get additional information about such data sharing.
1.5.1. International data transfers
When Microblink transfers personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area, we make sure the recipient offers a similar degree of protection and ensure that one of the following safeguards is in place:
That the data is transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data by the European Commission;
That the transfer is made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or International Data Transfer Agreement approved by Information Commissioner’s Office;
That the appropriate transfer risk assessment has been conducted to determine whether the recipient of the personal data can offer appropriate safeguards.
When transferring data to third countries, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the adequate level of security of your personal data by conducting transfer risk assessments.
1.6. Data retention period
Microblink will retain your personal data as long as it is required to fulfil the purpose of collection or for as long as the applicable law requires. Upon collection of your personal data, Microblink will disclose for how long it will process your personal data or, if that is not possible, provide criteria for determining that period. Some criteria we use for determining the retention period are categories of personal data processed, the necessity of processing personal data in question to achieve a specific purpose, prevailing legitimate interests of Microblink or any third party, or a legal obligation to retain the data.
If you are unsure how long we process your personal data, feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer via

1.7. Your rights related to the processed data
Each individual has a right to know what data Microblink holds about any such person. The rights every individual has in relation to personal data processed by Microblink are:
Right of access. You have the right to get confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed by Microblink. Where that is the case, you have the right to access your personal data and the following information: the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients or categories of recipients, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period, data subject’s rights, where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source and the existence of automated decision-making.
Right to rectification. You have the right to ask us to correct the personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.
Right to erasure. You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information if it is no longer necessary for the purpose which it was originally collected or processed for, if you withdraw your consent, if you object to the processing of your data, and if there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing or we process your data for direct marketing, if we have processed the personal data unlawfully or we have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.
Right to restriction of the processing. You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information when you think that your personal data we process is inaccurate, that the data has been unlawfully processed, when we no longer need the personal data but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or you have objected to us processing your data, and we are considering whether Microblink’s legitimate grounds override yours.
Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.

However, this does not automatically mean that we will erase all personal data we have about you. It is more likely that we will retain just enough information about you to ensure that your preference not to receive direct marketing is respected in future.
Right to data portability. You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information we have about you to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.
Contacting the supervisory authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

(“hereinafter: Terms”)
Latest update: May 2023
Microblink’s trademarks, service marks, industrial designs, trade names and copyrighted works, registered or unregistered (hereinafter jointly: “IP assets”), are of extreme value to Microblink as they represent important elements of Microblink’s corporate and brand identity.
The aim of these Terms is to provide an overview of rules and instructions on the permitted use of IP assets for Microblink’s (sub)licensees, vendors, resellers, event organizers and other partners or parties intending to use said intellectual property, be it for the purpose of providing information, promotion, advertising, mere reference or otherwise, either in physical or digital form.
For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms are incorporated into and are deemed as a supplement to any agreements entered into with Microblink and as such are contractually and legally binding. Without prejudice to the aforementioned and even if no agreement is in place between you and Microblink, these Terms shall be binding on you when you use the IP assets in any way or form. Therefore, should you not agree with any of the provisions of these Terms, please do not use the IP assets.
These Terms may be modified from time to time at Microblink’s discretion. Please review these Terms regularly to ensure that you are aware of any changes thereto by referring to the “Latest update” legend at the top of this webpage. By continuing to use the IP assets following the publication of the modification, you accept any such change or modification.
1. Scope of these Terms
Please note that these Terms encompass the use of IP assets of Microblink LLC and its affiliated companies, which are hereinafter jointly referred to as “Microblink”.
These Terms cover Microblink’s trademarks, service marks, industrial designs, trade names and copyrighted works, whether registered or unregistered. These Terms do not cover copyrights over Microblink software or any other intellectual property rights over Microblink technology, which is regulated through special agreements and/or terms executed between the relevant parties.
In case of any questions regarding these Terms or any use of Microblink IP assets, including software licensing, please reach out to Microblink’s Legal department at
legal@microblink.com
.
2. Ownership of the IP assets
By using the IP assets, in whole or in part, you acknowledge that Microblink is the sole owner thereof, and undertake not to interfere with the enjoyment of Microblink’s rights over IP assets, including, but not limited to, challenging the lawfulness of Microblink’s use, applications or registrations of IP assets, either standalone or jointly with other elements.
You agree not to apply for or register any of Microblink’s IP assets or confusingly similar alterations thereof, nor any other recognizable Microblink symbols, logos, icons, etc. as or as part of a trademark, industrial design, trade dress, copyrighted work, company name, trade name, product name, service name or domain. Furthermore, you undertake not to imitate the distinctive Microblink logo, website design, typeface or any recognizable element clearly connected to Microblink.
3. Use of the IP assets
3.1. Consent for the use of the IP assets
Any use of IP assets without Microblink’s specific prior consent is deemed unlawful. Microblink reserves the right to object to your use of the IP assets without the appropriate consent even if you include a disclaimer in your product, printed or digital material stating that said product or material was developed or published independently or that the use was not authorized or approved by Microblink.
Microblink may revoke the consent to use IP assets at any time at its own discretion, particularly if such use is contrary to these Terms, Terms of Use, Microblink’s internal policies or if the IP assets are used in a derogatory manner. If the consent is revoked, you shall immediately take all steps necessary to cease the use of IP assets, delete, eliminate, and destroy at your own expense all materials and content bearing the IP assets and provide Microblink with written confirmation of deletion, elimination and destruction within 10 days as of the consent revocation.

If the appropriate consent is provided, Microblink thereby grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free (unless agreed otherwise), non-sublicensable (unless agreed otherwise) license to use relevant IP assets subject to these Terms and a special agreement executed between you and Microblink (if applicable).
3.3. Misuse of IP assets
By using IP assets, you agree not to misuse the IP assets in any way, particularly if such misuse resulted in or could result in harm to the IP assets, Microblink brand or Microblink’s reputation.
Examples of misuse of IP assets are:
use that represents or results in a defamatory, inaccurate, obsolete, abusive, obscene, profane, offensive, sexually-oriented, threatening, harassing, racially offensive use,
use that, at Microblink’s discretion, discredits Microblink or tarnishes its reputation and goodwill,
use that infringes, dilutes, depreciates the value, or impairs intellectual property rights contained in the IP assets,
false or misleading use,
use that violates any law, regulations, or other public policy,
use of trademarks owned by Microblink as nouns or verbs (e.g., you sublicense a “PhotoPay license” and not “PhotoPay”),
use of trademarks owned by Microblink in a possessive form (e.g., “BlinkID’s”),
use of abbreviated forms of trademarks or terms connected to Microblink (e.g., “MB products”),
misspelling and capitalization of terms connected to Microblink (e.g., “MicroBlink”, “Micro Blink” or “Mikroblink” instead of “Microblink”, “BlinkId” instead of “BlinkID” etc.).
3.4. Violations of Microblink’s rights by you or third persons
Please note that Microblink is dedicated to ensuring maximum protection of IP assets with all legal means available, including litigation for any infringements of intellectual property, unfair trade or unfair competition, as available under the applicable laws.
Please notify Microblink in writing immediately upon discovery of any unlawful applications or registrations of IP assets by third persons, as well as any unauthorized use of IP assets. By using the IP assets, you undertake to reasonably cooperate with Microblink to cease any infringement of IP assets by third persons and to prevent any further unlawful use thereof.
4. Warranty, indemnification and limitation of liability

MICROBLINK WARRANTS THAT ALL REGISTRATIONS OF IP ASSETS CONFORM WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS AND THAT MICROBLINK IS THE SOLE OWNER THEREOF.

4.2. Limitation of liability
UNLESS EXPLICITLY AGREED OTHERWISE BETWEEN YOU AND MICROBLINK AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MICROBLINK AND MICROBLINK’S REPRESENTATIVES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND PARTNERS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF IP ASSETS. WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, YOU AGREE THAT MICROBLINK’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THESE TERMS SHALL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE FEES, IF ANY, PAID TO MICROBLINK FOR THE USE OF IP ASSETS, AND IN ANY CASE, SHALL NOT EXCEED 1000 USD.
IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, THE APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN SUCH CASES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION SHALL NOT APPLY TO YOU AND MICROBLINK’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE APPLICABLE LAW.
4.3. Indemnification
Unless agreed otherwise in writing, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold Microblink (and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents) harmless from and against any third person’s claims, demands, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), losses or requests for damages resulting from or arising out of your breach of these Terms, or your violation of any applicable laws or third party’s rights with regard to the IP assets. Nothing in these Terms shall be deemed to exclude or limit your liability in respect of any indemnity given by you under these Terms.
5. Lawful use of the IP assets for particular activities
Products and applications of Microblink’s (sub)licensees and partners and the corresponding product documentation
All Microblink (sub)licensees, vendors, resellers and other partners (individually referred to as “partner”, jointly as “partners”) must use IP assets only in a manner consistent with these Terms and, as applicable, any relevant provisions of the appropriate agreement executed between the relevant parties.
Unless agreed otherwise in writing, partners shall use their best efforts not to misconceive the relevant public that the partner’s solution was created or developed exclusively by Microblink. In that regard, the following must be followed:
There should be a clear distinction between the partner’s and Microblink’s solution;
IP assets must not appear any more prominent than the partner’s solution name or logo;
In case of an equal partnership (e.g. in a solution embedding Microblink’s and partner’s software), IP assets must not appear any less prominent than the partner’s solution name or logo.
Conferences, seminars and other events
The use of IP assets during conferences, seminars and other events entails e.g. placement on banners, advertising material (either in print or digital), introductory presentations to announce Microblink’s sponsorship or other support, etc. Such use requires appropriate consent by Microblink, which may be encompassed in an appropriate agreement between Microblink and the event organizer or another person authorized by the event organizer, or in addition to the mentioned agreement in writing.
Unless otherwise agreed, the event organizer shall use best efforts to ensure that the relevant public attending the conference, seminar and other events is not in any way led into the misconception that the seminar was partially or fully organized by Microblink, including, but not limited to, by displaying IP assets more prominently than all other logos or names, including the logo or name of the event’s organizer or the event itself. The event organizer shall clearly distinguish any sponsorship relationships with Microblink (e.g. by listing Microblink as one of the sponsors on a sponsors list or by using the term “Sponsored by Microblink”).
For any material distributed during the events for promotional, informational or other purposes, please see the following paragraph.
Advertising, promotional, informational and sales materials
IP assets may only be used in advertising, promotional, informational and sales materials, digital or physical, based on Microblink’s prior consent contained in an appropriate agreement executed between the relevant parties or otherwise in writing. All use of the IP assets must be in accordance with the provisions of the mentioned agreement (as applicable) and these Terms.
Microblink reserves the right to request the submission of finalized advertising, promotional, and sales materials for review. Any reference to Microblink or IP assets must not confuse or misguide the relevant public in any way, including by reasonably leading them into believing that the advertising, promotional or sales materials came directly from Microblink, unless approved by Microblink in writing.
If the IP assets are published as an element of printed material for the purpose of advertising Microblink’s sponsorship, such a publication should clearly stress the sponsorship relationship (e.g. by including the wording “Sponsored by Microblink”).
No merchandise, such as beverages, T-shirts, mugs, lanyards etc. featuring IP assets may be manufactured, sold, gifted or distributed in any way, without Microblink’s specific consent, a request for which should encompass a finalized merchandise visual design or its mockup.
6. Supersedence
These Terms and any applicable additional guidelines included herein by reference, contain the entire understanding between you and Microblink and supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, with the exception of specific terms of particular agreements concluded between you and Microblink, in which case the terms of that agreement will precede these Terms.
Moreover, to the greatest extent provided by law, the relevant provisions of these Terms and any agreements between you and Microblink supersede any right to use or refer to the IP assets provided by law (whether as a “fair use”, “fair dealing”, the exception to the exclusivity of an IP right or otherwise) and YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS.
7. Waiver and severability
Microblink’s failure to exercise any rights under these Terms shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights or a waiver or forfeiture of such rights in the future. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by the competent court or tribunal for any reason, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
8. Governing law and resolution of disputes
You agree that the laws applicable to the registrations of the IP assets or the owner of the IP assets shall apply, unless otherwise established by the appropriate agreement between you and Microblink based on which the IP assets are used, without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions.
9. Assignment
You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms without Microblink’s prior written consent, and any such unauthorized assignment and delegation shall be ineffective.

Therefore, we expect compliance from our collaborators with all applicable laws and regulations relating to these areas, and we expect these individuals to report any suspicions or concerns they may have. In this respect, we expect our employees and partners to:
act with honesty and avoid any act that may constitute illegal behavior or fraud;
contact us without delay to discuss any knowledge or suspicion of potential or actual wrongdoing, unlawful acts, or fraudulent activity relating to money laundering, fraud, and other unlawful behavior; and

We use different types of Cookies on our Site:
Session Cookies – These allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session, and may be used for a variety of purposes. These session Cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored longer term. For this reason session Cookies may sometimes be considered less privacy intrusive than persistent Cookies.
Persistent Cookies – These are stored on a users' device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent Cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering users' preferences and choices when using a site or to target advertising.
First and third party Cookies – Whether a Cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the website or domain placing the Cookie. First party Cookies in basic terms are Cookies set by a website visited by the user - the website displayed in the URL window. Third party Cookies are Cookies that are set by a domain other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a Cookie through that website this would be a third party Cookie. We allow third parties such as Google, Facebook, Segment, Bing and LinkedIn to use Cookies to collect information from the Site and elsewhere on the Internet (including your browsing activity across other websites) and use that information to provide analytics and measurement services and tailored advertising.
Tracking Options and Cookie Preferences.
Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer. You may adjust your browser or operating system settings to allow all Cookies or perform the following functions: delete all Cookies; block all Cookies; block third party Cookies; clear all Cookies when you close the browser; open a ‘private browsing’/‘incognito’ session (which allows you to browse the Internet without storing local data); and install add ons and plug ins to extend browser functionality.

Introduction
The Privacy program of Twilio Inc. and its
group companies
(‘Twilio’, ‘we’ or ‘our’) is built on our
Binding Corporate Rules
('BCRs'), which serve as our code of conduct that governs our global processing of personal data.
In order to provide products and services ('Services') to our customers and conduct our day-to-day business operations, including the operation of our websites, we collect, use and share, or otherwise process personal data about our customers, our customers’ authorized users ('end user') and their customers, our website visitors and business contacts.
Personal data
is any information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address, or that indirectly identifies you, for example a phone number or device identifier.
The personal data we may collect and process about you varies depending on our relationship with you. We may have a direct relationship with you because you have set up an account or consented to receive marketing communications from us, or we may have an indirect relationship with you via your relationship with one of our customers; for example you may be their employee or their customer.
We take privacy, data protection and our legal obligations very seriously. We are committed to being transparent with you about how we use personal data. This Privacy Notice ('Notice') aims to describe our privacy practices in a clear, accessible and easy to understand way and to let you know how you can exercise your rights in relation to your data.
This Notice applies where Twilio processes personal data as a
data controller
, in connection with the Services we provide to our customers and the operation of our business, including our websites.  As a data controller, we determine the purpose (why) and means (how) of personal data processing and are ultimately responsible for the correct handling of your data, in accordance with applicable law.  This Notice describes our general privacy practices. Depending on how you interact with us or the specific services you use, additional privacy notices may apply. These supplemental notices will be provided to you at or before the time we collect your personal data. These supplemental notices should be read together with this Notice and are incorporated by reference.
This Notice
does not apply
to the Personal Data we process in relation to job applicants. This is covered by our
Global Applicant Privacy Notice
.
We also process personal data for most of our Services as a
data processor
. As a data processor, we process personal data related to our customers' employees, end users and customers on behalf of our customers to provide Services to them in accordance with their instructions. These instructions are set out in our customer agreements,
Data Protection Addendum
, service specific terms or through a customer's use or configuration of a product feature.  You should contact these organizations directly for information about how they process your personal data as a
data controller
and to exercise your rights in relation to that data.

We also ask you to create a password and name your account (or accounts, if you have more than one).
Customer Account Data -
We process certain personal data to manage our relationship with you and administer you or your company’s account. This includes purchase history, names or contact information of individuals authorized to manage the Twilio account on behalf of our customer to set up, access and manage billing.

Payment Information -
In connection with Services you pay for, we ask you to provide our payment processor with your payment method information like a credit card or your Paypal account and your billing address. Our payment processor, acting on our behalf, gathers this so we can bill you for your use of our Services. Our payment processor will share your billing address with Twilio for this purpose.
Personalization Details -
Some of our products, such as our short code service, may require you to complete an application form by providing details about your or your company’s  intended use of the product to determine eligibility for these products.

Support and Feedback -

Security Identifiers or SIDs -
When you sign up for an account with Twilio, we’ll automatically assign you and each of your accounts a unique security ID and generate an API token for each account.

This includes information such as the number of phone calls, call destinations, call locations, type, and service configuration, and is known as Customer Proprietary Network Information ('CPNI').

How We Disclose Personal Data
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network ('PSTN') to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top ('OTT') communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
If we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements);
to enforce our agreements and policies;
to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, including security threats, spam and fraud; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in our
Binding Corporate Rules
.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you or our customers of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
International Data Transfers
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other Services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit the
DPF website
.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set of
Binding Corporate Rules
for internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policy
here
.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found
here
.
How We Secure Personal Data
To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in our
Security Overview
.
How Long We Retain Personal Data
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
’ below), we will honor this request, unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, such as billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.
Your Rights and Choices About Your Data
Depending on the data protection laws applicable to you, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal data that we process as a data controller:
that we provide details about the categories of personal data that we collect about you, including how we collect and share it;
that we provide you access to, and a copy of, the personal data we collect about you;
that we update or correct any inaccurate personal data we have about you;
that we delete the personal data we have about you;
that we restrict processing of personal data about you;
that we provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used format and to transmit that information to another controller, and where feasible, transmit the information directly;
that we provide you with the right to object to the processing of personal data, including profiling;
that we provide you with a free, easy mechanism to object to use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes;
that you not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects or similarly affects your individual rights;
to withdraw your consent; and
to complain to a competent supervisory authority and/or to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Twilio will honor your rights subject to limitations in certain situations, such as where Twilio can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement or legitimate interest to process your data or can legitimately apply an exemption to the exercise of a right under applicable law. More information about these rights can be found in our Binding Corporate Rules Controller Policy
Rule 10
and
Appendix 3
.
If you are a
US resident
interested in what personal data we have disclosed lately for our business purposes, here’s a list:
Identifiers
Commercial information
Financial information
Internet or other electronic activity information
Geolocation information
Professional or employment information
By “our business purposes,” we mean that we only disclose personal data as we describe in the section "
How We Disclose Personal Data
" above.  Also, as described in the “How We Use Cookies & Other Tracking technologies” section below, we process personal data to deliver ads targeted to your interests on other companies’ websites and mobile apps. Some of these activities may be considered “sharing” or “targeted advertising” under certain laws. You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal data for targeted advertising, and can do so by adjusting your preferences using our Cookie Preferences Tool located on the bottom right of the Twilio website you are visiting. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset.
You also have the right to request the restriction of processing of your sensitive personal information. Where applicable, the respective sensitive personal information will be marked accordingly and may only be processed by us for certain purposes. At the current time, however, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those expressed in this Privacy Notice or otherwise permitted by applicable law, and these uses cannot be limited under California law.
You may have additional rights under our
Binding Corporate Rules
in the EU. For example, where you believe your personal data has been transferred by an EU-based Twilio company to our US headquarters and processed by the US company in breach of the Binding Corporate Rules, you may have a right to:
Lodge a complaint with the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe;
Lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the same country as the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe; and
Bring a court action against the Twilio company that transferred your data outside Europe.
If Twilio processes your personal data as a data processor on behalf of a customer, we will either direct you to contact our customer to exercise your rights.
How To Exercise Your Rights and Choices
The following sections provide information about how to exercise certain rights in relation to your personal data. To exercise any other rights, please contact us at

Customer Support

After closure of your account, certain information associated with your account may remain on Twilio’s servers in an aggregated form that does not identify you. Similarly, after you close your account, we will retain data — including personal data — associated with your account that we are required to maintain for legal purposes or for necessary business operations (see “
How Long We Retain Personal  Data
” section above) until it’s no longer needed.
Identity Verification
In some instances, we will need to verify your identity before honoring your request. We will generally verify your identity by asking you to provide personal data related to your recent interactions with us. Thereafter, we will process your request and inform you of any decisions we have made about your request.  Additionally, you may exercise your privacy rights through an authorized agent. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please contact us at
privacy@twilio.com
.
We won’t discriminate against you or change the price of our services if you make a request, but if you ask us to delete your data, it may affect your ability to use our Services.
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)
As an individual Twilio account holder or as an authorized representative of a Twilio customer in the US, you have the right to restrict Twilio’s use of
CPNI
. To opt-out of the use of CPNI data related to your Twilio account to market other Twilio Services based on your usage of our Services, click
here
.  Please note that, if you have subscribed for the services on behalf of an organization, the CPNI relates to the service usage by that organization and not you individually. Opting-out of the use of CPNI for marketing will not unsubscribe you from other types of marketing contacts from Twilio and will not affect the status of the services you currently have with us. Your approval or opt-out of the use of your CPNI outside of the services to which you are already subscribed is valid until you affirmatively revoke or limit such approval.
Communication Preferences
You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time through your marketing preferences page by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any marketing email you receive from Twilio. You can also
update your communication preferences
using our online form or contact our

This makes navigating and interacting with our websites or your account more efficient, easy and meaningful for you.
Twilio uses both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies are cookies that disappear from your computer or browser when you turn off your computer. Persistent cookies stay on your computer even after you’ve turned it off.

Automated Decision Making
Automated decision-making occurs when an electronic system uses personal data to make a decision about you, without human involvement. Twilio uses automated decision-making leveraging a variety of signals derived from records we collect or obtain from third party vendors, to help monitor, identify, and suspend accounts sending spam or engaging in other abusive or fraudulent activity.  We may also use this information to evaluate your account application and make decisions about whether to approve or decline. If your account is suspended or not approved under these circumstances you will be notified and given an opportunity to request human review of the decision.
We may rely on other automated decision-making where:
We have notified you of the decision and provided you with the opportunity to request a human review of the decision
It is necessary to perform a contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights
We have your consent and we have put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights

Twilio Product Privacy
Twilio offers a range of industry-leading communications and customer data platform services to our customers. Depending on the Service, Twilio may be a data controller and data processor of personal data used to provide the Services.
Twilio processes personal data (Communications Usage Data and Customer Content) for most of our Services as a data processor acting on the instruction of our customer and in accordance with the terms of our agreement with a customer, our
Data Protection Addendum
, and service specific terms. Our Services provide customers with ways to control, access and secure their data.
We also offer customers the ability to store, delete, access, or exercise other choices about their personal data. The ability to make these choices depends on the Service being used and how it is being used by a customer. Customers are referred to our
API docs
for each of our Services, along with SendGrid’s
documentation
and Segment’s
documentation
to find more detailed information about managing personal data collected and stored in connection with their use of our Services. We also provide an overview of our retention and deletion practices, including how to delete data you control in our
support documentation

Authy
The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to our other Services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Frontline Services
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see the
Frontline App Terms
for specific details about your relationship with us.
SendGrid Services
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “
How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
” above.
Voice Intelligence
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.
