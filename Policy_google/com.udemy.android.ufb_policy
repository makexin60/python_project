Udemy Business Privacy Statement
This Udemy Business Privacy Statement was updated on September 6, 2024.
In the course of providing Udemy Business (
“UB”
) services and related services to its corporate, non-profit organization, and governmental customers (
“Customers”
), Udemy will receive and have access to personal data of individual users to whom customers grant access (
“Users”
). For the purposes of this privacy statement, Customers are data controllers and Udemy is a data processor. Udemy’s processing of User data and the security measures implemented to protect such data are detailed in and governed by a written agreement between Udemy and each of its Customers.
As a data processor, Udemy will access, store and use the personal data of individual Users solely for the purpose of providing the UB services to its Customers and will process the data as instructed by its Customers.
As data controllers, Customers decide which of their employees or other authorized persons are given access to the UB services. They do this by designating one or more UB account administrators or group administrators (
“Administrator”
) who act on behalf of the Customer and have the ability to customize the Customer account, manage individual User accounts, access the UB Insights tool and related reporting features, access the UB Administrator tools, and populate the Customer account with Customer-provided content. Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, relating to the collection of personal information relating to individual Users selected by Customers for accessing the UB services. Udemy has no direct relationship with individual Users, who should contact Customers (their organization) for assistance with any requests or questions relating to the processing of their personal information.
For avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Statement
does not apply to
:
any processing of data for the purpose of marketing the UB service to enterprise and corporate prospects; and
any other offerings available at Udemy.com separate from the UB services, for which the
Udemy Privacy Policy
is applicable. A User may already have an account with Udemy to access Udemy’s consumer services (
“Consumer Services”
), and data processed as a result of the use of the Udemy Consumer Services from a User account is governed by the
Udemy Privacy Policy
.
In the event where Udemy makes any material changes to the manner in which it processes User data to provide its services to Customers, it will notify Customers.
Udemy Business Privacy Statement
Information about Users collected and stored by Udemy
Purpose of User Data Processing and Retention Period
Cookies and other Tracking Technologies
Sharing User Information
Processing of User Data outside of the EEA
Jurisdiction-Specific Information
General
1. Information about Users collected and stored by Udemy
When a User is given access to the UB services by the Administrator, a User may set up an individual User account and Udemy will collect information provided by the User or the Administrator. The Customer can customize the type of data requested to create an account, which may include the following:
Email address (required)
First and last name
Profile photo, areas of interest, job skills, goals, and role (optionally provided by User or Customer)
Other personal data, as allowed by the Customer
A unique identifying number is assigned by Udemy upon the creation of a User account.
User profile pages may be viewable by other Users in the same UB organization but are not viewable by individuals outside of the organization.
Administrators may assign a User to a group membership.
Customers may choose to integrate UB with a Single Sign On (SSO) identity provider to enable Users to log in to UB User accounts without the need to disclose hashed passwords to Udemy. Users may log in by providing their individual SSO credentials to the SSO identity provider, which will authenticate them and allow or deny access to the Customer account. SSO identity providers share with Udemy authentication information about the User as an authorized user of Customer.
Customers may choose whether Administrators and Users can interact with others (including with instructors, teaching assistants, and other students) by posting reviews about educational content, messaging or chatting, posting questions or answers, or posting other content. Posted content is stored by Udemy and may be publicly available or viewable by others, including Administrators, Users, or instructors and teaching assistants, depending on where the content is posted.
At the option of the Customer, Administrators may enable the ability to “Share to Slack.” This feature allows Users to manually or automatically post a message to the Customer’s own instance of the Slack messaging service. To enable this optional functionality, Customer's Slack administrators must grant Udemy the ability to read the full list of public channels, private channels, and users in the Customer’s Slack instance. These lists may include individuals in Customer’s Slack instance who are not UB Users. Slack user lists and channels are briefly cached before being automatically purged from Udemy's systems. Information from Slack is used to deliver the Services and is not used for any other purpose.
Udemy stores information relating to the activities of Users as they use and interact with the UB services, such as content viewed, searched for, or accessed (and information relating to that content); interactions with instructors, teaching assistants, Administrators, moderators (in the case of Leadership Academy), and other Users; as well as answers, essays, and other items submitted by Users to satisfy the educational content requirements.  This information is linked to a User’s unique account ID and is shared with Customers via the Customer account reporting tools or upon request of the Customer.
Customers may have the option to enable features that are powered by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). Customer personal data is not used to train or fine tune GenAI models used for the benefit of other Customers. Leadership Academy users may have their cohort discussions summarized by GenAI.
The UB service enables Users to contact the Udemy Support Team for assistance or to report a problem, concern, potential abuse, or other issues regarding the UB services or other users. Udemy may collect and store the User’s name, email address, location, operating system, IP address as well as the User’s activity on the Udemy platform and communications with the Udemy help desk team.  Udemy may request additional information from Users in order to resolve any issue reported by a User or by another user.
When a User uses the UB services, Udemy collects and stores certain information by automated means: (a) technical information about the User’s computer or wireless device, such as IP address, operating system type and version, unique device ID, browser, browser language, domain, and other operating systems or platform information. This information is collected through the use of server log files and tracking technologies, such as: (i) cookies, which are small files that websites send to a computer or wireless device to uniquely identify a browser or mobile device or to store information in a browser setting; and (ii) other tracking technologies (see below for more detailed information).
IP addresses received from browsers or devices of Users may be used to determine the approximate location of Users.
2. Purpose of User Data Processing and Retention Period
Udemy processes the information collected about Users and Administrators for the purpose of providing the UB services to its Customers, specifically:
Providing, administering, and facilitating access to the UB services, for Customers and Users, and managing Customer or User account preferences
Fulfilling Customer’s instructions with respect to personal data of Users
Communicating with Users, including via email, for the purpose of:
Responding to User questions or concerns
Making notifications to Users at the request of the Customer
Sending Users administrative messages and information, including confirmation of account creation, enrollment and progress in courses and related content, and notifications of responses from instructors to User questions
Providing information to Users about available content, new UB service features, and personalized content recommendations, which Users can opt out of at any time
Sending updates and other relevant messages via push notifications to User wireless devices, which can be managed from the “options” or “settings” page in the mobile application
Enabling communications among Users and instructors or teaching assistants
Incorporating feedback into and improving the UB services
Resolving User support requests or claims
If we are not able to collect and process your personal information, we may be unable to provide some or all of the UB Services to you.
Email Preferences
Users can individually opt out of receiving non-transactional emails by: (i) following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email communication; or (ii) managing User account email preferences.  A Customer can also instruct Udemy to configure email preference settings for all Users in their UB account.
Retention of Personal Data
Udemy will retain the data of Users for as long as instructed by the Customer and no longer than required to serve the purposes of processing.  Udemy will delete certain or all personal data relating to Users upon request of the Customer.  Udemy may retain aggregated or anonymized data as set forth below.
Use of aggregated or anonymized data
User data may be aggregated or anonymized to enable Udemy to improve its products and services and develop new products and services, including:
Reviewing and analyzing User browser and wireless device technical information
Reviewing user activity across UB and the Udemy Consumer Services (for example, Udemy analyzes trends and User traffic and usage information to identify popular content)
Facilitating the technical functioning of the UB services and Udemy Consumer Services, including to troubleshoot and resolve issues, secure the UB services, and prevent fraud and abuse
When User data is used for the above purposes, it is aggregated and/or anonymized so that no personal data of Users is processed. This non-personal data may be retained for as long as it is needed to serve the purposes identified above.
3. Cookies and other Tracking Technologies
Like many online platforms, Udemy uses server log files and automated data collection tools, such as browser cookies and scripts. Cookies are small text files placed onto a computer or device while browsing the Internet. Cookies are used to collect, store, and share bits of information about User activities.  Udemy uses both session cookies and persistent cookies to deliver and secure the UB service; provide functionality, like customizing a user’s view or remembering a user’s preferences; and measure site, service, or feature usage. Udemy may tie the information collected by these means to the unique account ID of Users. UB does not employ any targeted advertising or social media cookies.
To view a complete list of cookies and your options, Users may click the “Cookie settings” link on the footer of the UB site.
User Preferences with respect to cookies and other tracking technologies
Users can adjust their cookie settings by clicking the “Cookie settings” link on the footer of the UB site, or they may set their web browser to notify them about the placement of new cookies, limit the type of cookies or reject cookies altogether. If a browser is set to block cookies, Users may not be able to use some or all of the features of the UB services (for example, may not be able to log in). General information about cookies and how to disable them can be found at
https://cookiepedia.co.uk/how-to-manage-cookies
.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.
4. Sharing User Information
In order to provide the UB services to its Customers, Udemy shares data regarding Users with a number of third-party service providers. These third parties are contractually required to use User data solely as directed by Udemy for the purpose of providing services to Udemy. Administrators of existing Customers are able to access our list of current sub-processors on the left sidebar of this page while logged in to UB.
Instructors who upload content on the Udemy platform, as well as their teaching assistants, may receive names of enrolled Users, to enable them to respond to user questions and feedback. Instructors do not receive the email addresses of Users.
Other service providers of Customer may receive information as instructed by Customer.
To perform its services, Udemy uses cloud hosting services on which certain content and User data relating to UB is hosted.
Udemy’s help center platform vendor hosts and stores all communications between Administrators or Users and the Udemy Support Team. The help center vendor is contractually required to store and process User related data solely as directed by Udemy for the purpose of providing services to Udemy. Udemy also partners with a chat messaging vendor to provide support to Users and Administrators, to collect feedback, and to display in-app messages for feature announcements or onboarding new users.
Udemy shares User information with third-party companies that perform email services to enable Udemy to send email communications to Users and to manage email preference settings of Users.
For Leadership Academy Users, certain features like chat rooms, message boards, news groups, or other public forums are available and are visible to other participants, so confidential or proprietary information should only be shared in accordance with their organization’s standards.
Any other sharing of User data is subject to the consent and instructions of the Customer.
5. Cross-Border Processing of User Data
Our servers and subprocessors are located in the United States. In order to provide the Services to you, we transfer and process your data there.
If personal data processed by Udemy originates from a User or Administrator in the EEA, Udemy will ensure that such processing will only take place if: (a) the non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection; (b) the transfer is made pursuant to a Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) executed between Udemy and the Customer and subject to a lawful transfer mechanism, like the Data Privacy Framework (for eligible entities) or the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (also known as “Model Clauses”), which have been incorporated into the DPA.
6. Jurisdiction-Specific Information
Australia.
If you are located in Australia, you may contact our privacy team at
privacy@udemy.com
in order to:
request access to or seek correction of your personal information; or
make a complaint about a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles which will be investigated and responded to within 30 days.
7. General
Translation for Convenience Purposes Only.
In the event that Customer has been provided a translated version of the Udemy Business Privacy Statement in a language other than English, that translation is provided for convenience purposes only. The English version of the UB Privacy Statement provided at
https://www.udemy.com/terms/ub-privacy/
is controlling, and in the event of a conflict between the English version of this Privacy Statement and any translated version, the English version will prevail.Development
