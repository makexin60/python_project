As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.

The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:

with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.
Consent-based processing of personal data
If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.
Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations
Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.

of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
You have the right to obtain from us the
erasure
of personal data concerning you under certain conditions (e.g. when the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were processed or when they are no longer required for overriding legitimate grounds, such as the detection/prevention of fraud), unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law. Please note that it is not possible to erase data from the blockchain. Please see section
11. Other important information regarding data protection
for further information.
You have the right to request that we
restrict the processing of your personal data
to the extent that

The cookies and similar technologies used in connection with the Services have different functions:
They may be technically necessary for the provision of our Services
They help us optimize our Services technically (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)
They help us improve your user experience (e.g. save font size and form data entered)

11. Other important information regarding data protection
This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.
Learn more about section 11
What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?
Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.
When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.
To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).
Use of our Services through third-party applications
If you use our Services from within a third-party application, that application may also collect your data in accordance with their separate privacy policies. When accessing our Services from a web browser within a third-party application (e.g. Facebook's in-app browser), you should also review that application's privacy policy for information about the application's processing of your personal data.
Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay
When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our
User Agreement
.
Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.
You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our
User Agreement
.
Personal data relating to third parties
If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.
Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools
All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our
User Agreement
(including any of our
rules and policies
), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.
This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our
User Agreement
and our other
rules and policies
(e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the
prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay
.
Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?
Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the
Payments Terms of Use
- opens in new window or tab
and/or to comply with legal obligations. For example, under the
Payments Terms of Use
- opens in new window or tab
you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfill our legal "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations. As described in our User Privacy Notice and in the
Payments Terms of Use
- opens in new window or tab
, we may share this data with other eBay Affiliates in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.
Children's Privacy
Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.
Staying Signed in
When you sign into your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed into your account for a certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:
Bid, buy or make an offer on an item
Check out or add items to your cart
Purchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)
View the activity header
View the My eBay page
View or edit the Watchlist or order details
View the profile page
Send member-to-member messages
Conduct after-sale activities, like leaving feedback, canceling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims
If you attempt to change your password or username, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.
You can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.
Blockchain and Controllership
Certain features in our marketplace may enable tokens, smart contracts, and/or other digital assets (e.g. immutable tokens for eBay Authenticity Certificates) to be deployed to a public blockchain with your separate agreement to certain terms and conditions. Please note that notwithstanding other provisions in this User Privacy Notice addressing data controllership, the blockchain is an inherently public and decentralized infrastructure that cannot be controlled by any one person or group and is therefore outside of our ability to control. For example, details of blockchain-based transactions are immutable and cannot be deleted by any one person or group.
To the extent that certain Services involve personal data processed on eBay websites or applications such as through account or wallet registration, customer service interactions, or marketing activities, one of the eBay Affiliates is responsible for the processing of your personal data depending on the region in which you reside (see section
2. Controller
above). Such eBay Affiliate is also the controller for its independent activities involving your personal data on the blockchain to verify and manage risk involving digital wallets or to enable features for brands, collectors, sellers, traders, or such eBay Affiliate for user engagement or marketing purposes. By contrast, neither eBay Inc. nor an eBay Affiliate is the controller for activities you choose to conduct via the blockchain, publicly visible digital wallets, or other decentralized networks (e.g. which allow you to engage in transactions on public blockchains and which inherently involve personal data placed on the public blockchain ledger). In addition, we may engage third-party partners who may act as independent data controllers to assist to facilitate transactions you request, and your interactions with that third-party partner as an independent data controller are governed by the applicable terms of service and privacy policy of that third party.
12. eBay and AI
Responsible AI
We are committed to developing and using artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly, ensuring that we use AI to enhance the eBay experience and respect the needs of the entire eBay community. To achieve this, we have invested in a robust Responsible AI (RAI) approach at eBay which leverages the RAI principles set out in our
RAI Policy
- opens in new window or tab
. These principles direct the development, deployment, and use of AI at eBay.
Use of AI
We may use AI-powered tools and products for various purposes, including:
To improve and enhance our Services.
To offer you new or enhanced features and products (such as AI-powered listing generation, image background enhancement, and AI assistants).
To make information about listings and services more accessible, such as by offering AI-generated summaries of product reviews.
To offer you a more customized and personalized experience.
To provide you with enhanced customer service, for example, to bring real-time answers to chat, to analyze customer service interactions to improve their quality or to better understand customer pain points, and to help respond to customer queries.
To support fraud detection, and compliance checks, and to detect suspicious activity on our properties.
To analyze data for specific patterns (e.g. for market research purposes).
To support us in our day-to-day work (e.g. to create summaries, to translate text or to generate images).
AI-powered tools and products may involve personal data processing, but this is not necessarily the case. We use both our own AI models and third-party AI models and systems to deliver AI-powered tools and products. If our use of AI involves the processing of personal data, we rely on the legal bases set out in Section
5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients
above for the purposes mentioned therein. If we use any AI system that interacts directly with you, we will let you know.
AI development and training
Where permitted under applicable law, we use personal data collected from our users to train, test, validate, and align our own AI models as well as third-party AI models and systems that we use for the purposes outlined in this User Privacy Notice. This may include the personal data set out in Section
4. What personal data we collect and process
. We may combine personal data from our users with data from external sources (e.g. from publicly available sources). The use of personal data for AI development and training is based on our legitimate interest to achieve the objectives outlined under "Use of AI" above.
When training, testing, validating, and aligning AI models, we take appropriate steps to mitigate potential privacy impacts (e.g. through filtering, data masking, differential privacy techniques). Where applicable, our steps are based on data protection impact assessments and the legitimate interest assessment that we carry out. These take into account the purpose of the model, the need and suitability of certain training data, as well as measures that can be reasonably taken during training and thereafter.
AI-related individual rights
You have rights with regard to your personal data. See Section
8. Rights as a data subject
above for more details. Your rights also include the
right to object
- opens in new window or tab
to our processing of your personal data for AI development and training purposes.

6. Cross-border data transfers
Some recipients of your personal data are located outside your jurisdiction or have offices in jurisdictions where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your jurisdiction. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.
Learn more about section 6
6.1 Data transfers to eBay Affiliates
The transmission of personal data between eBay Affiliates (e.g. to enable cross border transactions and for other legally permitted purposes) is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2021/914/EU). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, eBay Affiliates undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the

6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)
We may transfer your personal data to recipients (see section 5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients) who may be located anywhere in the world. We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorized by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States (Data Privacy Framework) and Uruguay.

Additional information regarding the measures taken by us is available
on request
. We regularly re-evaluate the measures taken to assess requirements deriving from new regulatory guidance and case law.
7. Storage duration and erasure
Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section
5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients
for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.

The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:

This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.
Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations
Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.

11. Other important information regarding data protection
This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.
Learn more about section 11
What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?
Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.
When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.
To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).
Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay
When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.
Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.
You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our
User Agreement
.
Personal data relating to third parties
If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.
Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools
All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our
User Agreement
(including any of our
rules and policies
), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.
This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our
User Agreement
and our other
rules and policies
(e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the
prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay
.
Use of Artificial Intelligence or AI-Powered Tools

We use technologies that are considered automated decision making or profiling. We will not make any automated decisions about you that would significantly affect you unless such a decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract with you, we have obtained your consent, or we are required by applicable law to use such technology. You will find information on your right to object to this processing of your data below under section
8. Rights as a data subject
.
6. Cross-border data transfers
Some recipients of your personal data are located outside your jurisdiction or have offices in jurisdictions where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your jurisdiction. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.
Learn more about section 6
6.1 Data transfers to eBay Affiliates
The transmission of personal data between eBay Affiliates (e.g. to enable cross border transactions and for other legally permitted purposes) is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2021/914/EU for transfers from the EEA). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, eBay Affiliates undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the
eBay Privacy Center

.
6.2 Other data transfers (from the EEA, UK or Switzerland to third countries)
We may transfer your personal data to recipients (see section
5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients
) who may be located anywhere in the world. We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorized by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States (Data Privacy Framework) and Uruguay. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2021/914/EU) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. Additional information regarding the measures taken by us is available
on request
. We regularly re-evaluate the measures taken to assess requirements deriving from new regulatory guidance and case law.
7. Storage duration and erasure
Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section
5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients
for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.
Learn more about section 7
The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:
Necessity for the provision of our Services
This includes such things as executing the
User Agreement
and
Payments Terms of Use
- opens in new window or tab
with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.
Consent-based processing of personal data
If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.
Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations
Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.
8. Rights as a data subject
Subject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data. In addition, you can withdraw your consent and

rectification
of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
You have the right to obtain from us the
erasure
of personal data concerning you under certain conditions (e.g. when the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were processed or when they are no longer required for overriding legitimate grounds, such as the detection/prevention of fraud), unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law. Please note that it is not possible to erase data from the blockchain. Please see section
11. Other important information regarding data protection
for further information.
You have the right to request that we
restrict the processing of your personal data
to the extent that

right to object
to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation. This also applies to profiling.

9. Cookies & similar technologies
When you use our Services, we and authorized third parties make use of cookies and similar technologies (which we will refer to collectively as "cookies") to provide you with a better, faster and safer user experience or to show you personalized advertising. You can find detailed information about the use of cookies and similar technologies and your choices in our
User Cookie Notice
.

The cookies and similar technologies used in connection with the Services have different functions:
They may be technically necessary for the provision of our Services
They help us optimize our Services technically (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)
They help us improve your user experience (e.g. save font size and form data entered)

10. Data security
We protect your personal data through technical and organizational security measures to minimize risks associated with data loss, misuse, unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure and alteration. To this end we use network security services and data encryption, for example, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centers and logical access controls for data and systems access.

11. Other important information regarding data protection
This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.
Learn more about section 11
What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?
Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.
When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.
To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).
Use of our Services through third-party applications
If you use our Services from within a third-party application, that application may also collect your data in accordance with their separate privacy policies. When accessing our Services from a web browser within a third-party application (e.g. Facebook's in-app browser), you should also review that application's privacy policy for information about the application's processing of your personal data.
Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay
When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our
User Agreement
.
Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.
You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our
User Agreement
.
Personal data relating to third parties
If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.
Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools
All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our
User Agreement
(including any of our
rules and policies
), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.
This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our
User Agreement
and our other
rules and policies
(e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the
prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay
.
Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?
Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the
Payments Terms of Use
- opens in new window or tab
and/or to comply with legal obligations. For example, under the
Payments Terms of Use
- opens in new window or tab
you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfill our legal "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations. As described in our User Privacy Notice and in the
Payments Terms of Use
- opens in new window or tab
, we may share this data with other eBay Affiliates in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.
Children's Privacy
Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.
Staying Signed in
When you sign into your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed into your account for a certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:
Bid, buy or make an offer on an item
Check out or add items to your cart
Purchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)
View the activity header
View the My eBay page
View or edit the Watchlist or order details
View the profile page
Send member-to-member messages
Conduct after-sale activities, like leaving feedback, canceling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims
If you attempt to change your password or username, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.
You can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.
Blockchain and Controllership
Certain features in our marketplace may enable tokens, smart contracts, and/or other digital assets (e.g. immutable tokens for eBay Authenticity Certificates) to be deployed to a public blockchain with your separate agreement to certain terms and conditions. Please note that notwithstanding other provisions in this User Privacy Notice addressing data controllership, the blockchain is an inherently public and decentralized infrastructure that cannot be controlled by any one person or group and is therefore outside of our ability to control. For example, details of blockchain-based transactions are immutable and cannot be deleted by any one person or group.
To the extent that certain Services involve personal data processed on eBay websites or applications such as through account or wallet registration, customer service interactions, or marketing activities, one of the eBay Affiliates is responsible for the processing of your personal data depending on the region in which you reside (see section
2. Controller
above). Such eBay Affiliate is also the controller for its independent activities involving your personal data on the blockchain to verify and manage risk involving digital wallets or to enable features for brands, collectors, sellers, traders, or such eBay Affiliate for user engagement or marketing purposes. By contrast, neither eBay Inc. nor an eBay Affiliate is the controller for activities you choose to conduct via the blockchain, publicly visible digital wallets, or other decentralized networks (e.g. which allow you to engage in transactions on public blockchains and which inherently involve personal data placed on the public blockchain ledger). In addition, we may engage third-party partners who may act as independent data controllers to assist to facilitate transactions you request, and your interactions with that third-party partner as an independent data controller are governed by the applicable terms of service and privacy policy of that third party.
12. eBay and AI
Responsible AI
We are committed to developing and using artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly, ensuring that we use AI to enhance the eBay experience and respect the needs of the entire eBay community. To achieve this, we have invested in a robust Responsible AI (RAI) approach at eBay which leverages the RAI principles set out in our
RAI Policy
- opens in new window or tab
. These principles direct the development, deployment, and use of AI at eBay.
Use of AI
We may use AI-powered tools and products for various purposes, including:
To improve and enhance our Services.
To offer you new or enhanced features and products (such as AI-powered listing generation, image background enhancement, and AI assistants).
To make information about listings and services more accessible, such as by offering AI-generated summaries of product reviews.
To offer you a more customized and personalized experience.
To provide you with enhanced customer service, for example, to bring real-time answers to chat, to analyze customer service interactions to improve their quality or to better understand customer pain points, and to help respond to customer queries.
To support fraud detection, and compliance checks, and to detect suspicious activity on our properties.
To analyze data for specific patterns (e.g. for market research purposes).
To support us in our day-to-day work (e.g. to create summaries, to translate text or to generate images).
AI-powered tools and products may involve personal data processing, but this is not necessarily the case. We use both our own AI models and third-party AI models and systems to deliver AI-powered tools and products. If our use of AI involves the processing of personal data, we rely on the legal bases set out in Section
5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients
above for the purposes mentioned therein. If we use any AI system that interacts directly with you, we will let you know.
AI development and training
Where permitted under applicable law, we use personal data collected from our users to train, test, validate, and align our own AI models as well as third-party AI models and systems that we use for the purposes outlined in this User Privacy Notice. This may include the personal data set out in Section
4. What personal data we collect and process
. We may combine personal data from our users with data from external sources (e.g. from publicly available sources). The use of personal data for AI development and training is based on our legitimate interest to achieve the objectives outlined under "Use of AI" above.
When training, testing, validating, and aligning AI models, we take appropriate steps to mitigate potential privacy impacts (e.g. through filtering, data masking, differential privacy techniques). Where applicable, our steps are based on data protection impact assessments and the legitimate interest assessment that we carry out. These take into account the purpose of the model, the need and suitability of certain training data, as well as measures that can be reasonably taken during training and thereafter.
AI-related individual rights
You have rights with regard to your personal data. See Section
8. Rights as a data subject
above for more details. Your rights also include the
right to object

7. Storage duration and erasure
Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section
5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients
for more information on the processing purposes).

In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.

What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?
Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.
When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.
To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).
Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay
When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.
Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.
You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our
User Agreement
.
Personal data relating to third parties
If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.
Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools
All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our
User Agreement
(including any of our
rules and policies
), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.
This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our
User Agreement
and our other
rules and policies
(e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the
prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay
.

Our Principles
The privacy of your personal information is important to us. We are committed to providing you with an experience on all our sites and services that is safe, secure, and trustworthy.
Our Privacy Principles and What They Mean
Be transparent with the information we collect
We want our users to understand what information eBay collects and the value they receive in return.
We aim to explain to our users the information that we collect from them and what we plan on doing with it. Where we use techniques that gather information without your direct input, we will let our customers and users know and provide them options to limit this collection.
Allow users to easily access and update their own data
Having accurate information about our users helps create a smooth customer experience.
We will provide mechanisms where we can to give our users access to information related to their account and other interactions with eBay. We want our customers and users to be able to easily correct that information if it is wrong or out of date.
Be a guardian for user data and user privacy
Users trust us with their personal information and expect us to protect and use it appropriately.
We operate information privacy and information security programs that incorporate leading practices to manage personal data from collection through to destruction.
Be accountable to our privacy commitments
We take our commitment to privacy seriously and hold ourselves to a high standard.
Our program takes into account legal requirements and our commitments to our customers to deliver a trusted experience when interacting with eBay.
Give users meaningful choices in privacy
We know that control over personal information is important.
We give our users real and realistic choices about what information they share with us and how it is used, and provide visibility into those choices and how they can be updated.
Limit the sharing of customer information
We limit the sharing of customer information and provide our users with visibility into circumstances where we could share outside of eBay, and choices about the extent that information is shared.
Build and maintain safe products & services
We work hard to provide buyers and sellers a safe and trustworthy place to interact.
We have implemented a number of programs to protect everyone who uses eBay websites. With millions of transactions per day, a small number don’t go as planned. We have developed complaint and escalation processes to help resolve problems in a fair and consistent manner.
Our Commitment
Binding Corporate Rules
In addition to eBay Inc.'s privacy principles and the practices described in our privacy notice, eBay Inc. has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to as Binding Corporate Rules), approved by the Luxembourg National Data Commission.

4.  Your Privacy Rights
Depending on where you live, you may be able to assert certain rights related to your personal data. We encourage you to visit our
Privacy Center Contact
page for more information on your rights and our practices. We may deny certain requests where permitted or required by applicable law, including where granting the request would have a negative impact on another's privacy; to protect our rights and properties; where the request is excessive or overly burdensome; or where we suspect fraudulent activity. If we deny your request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
For eBay to fulfill your request, you must provide sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that you are the consumer from whom we collected the personal data. The information you send us to verify your identity will be used for this purpose only.
Subject to certain exceptions, you may be entitled to exercise the following rights:
Right to Access (also called a “Request to Know”).
You may have the right to know certain information about the personal data the business has collected about you and information about our processing activities, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing it, and information about third parties to whom we disclose it.
Right to Portability.
Under certain circumstances and to the extent technically feasible, you may have the right to receive personal data we hold about you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format so that you can provide that personal data to another entity.
Right to Correct.
You may have the right to request that we rectify, correct, or update your personal data held by us that is inaccurate.
Right to Delete.
You may have the right to request that we delete the personal data that we hold about you, subject to certain exceptions. For instance, in addition to the exceptions above, we may refuse your right to delete if it is reasonably necessary for us to provide a service requested by you; to perform a contract between us; to maintain functionality and ensure security of our systems; to enable solely expected internal uses of your personal data; to exercise a right provided by law; or to comply with a legal obligation.
Right to Opt-Out of Sale.
You may have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal data.
Right to Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising.
You may have the right to opt-out of processing of your personal data for purposes of targeted advertising based on your activity across non-affiliated websites, applications, and online services. Like many online marketplaces, we use cookies, pixels, and similar technology, and we share certain information, such as your IP address or device identifiers, to certain third-party advertisers in order to improve your user experience and to optimize our marketing activities. Please note that you may still receive generalized ads after opting out of targeted advertising and your eBay experience may still be personalized based on your eBay activity.
Right Against Discrimination.
You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described in this section. We will not discriminate against you for exercising or requesting to exercise your privacy rights.
How to Exercise Your Rights
Registered eBay users with accounts
To exercise your Right to Access and Right to Portability, please go to the
Account tab in My eBay
, select "Request your eBay data," and follow the instructions to submit your request.
For the Right to Delete, please go to our
Deleting your data
help page, select “Delete My Data” and follow the instructions. We will verify your identity using your existing username and password prior to accepting your request.
To exercise your Right to Correct, please go to your eBay
Account Settings
where you can directly correct your personal data. If you are unable to correct your personal data from Account Settings, please submit your request through our
Privacy Center webform
.
To exercise your Right to Opt-out of Sale or Targeted Advertising at the user-account level, please go to our State
Opt-out Rights
page or click on “Your Privacy Choices” in our website footer and toggle the switch to “out.” To ensure your choice is permanently associated with your eBay account, please ensure you are logged in to your eBay account before opting out. You may also exercise your opt-out of sale or share right, by going to our
Privacy Center webform
.
Depending on where you live, registered and non-registered users can also exercise their Right to Opt-out of Sale or Right to Opt-out of Sharing via the Global Privacy Control (GPC) browser signal. Where legally required, when we detect such a signal, we will honor that choice, including associating it with your eBay account when you are logged in. If not logged in to your eBay account, your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request. Learn more at the Global Privacy Control website.
Non-registered eBay users (e.g. guest users) or eBay users with suspended accounts
For non-registered eBay users and eBay users with suspended accounts, you may submit your Access, Portability, Correction, and Deletion requests through our Privacy Center webform.
eBay users with suspended accounts may be able to directly correct much of their personal data by going to their eBay Account Settings. If you are unable to correct your personal data from Account Settings, please submit your request through our
Privacy Center
webform.

Authorized agents
Depending on where you live, you may also be entitled to submit certain requests through an authorized agent. To designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights, we will require written proof that the authorized agent has been authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable law. If you are a registered agent and want to exercise rights on behalf of a user with a registered eBay account in good standing, you should work with the user to submit an access request directly through his or her account.
If you are submitting a request to opt-out of sale or targeted advertising, to the extent applicable, on behalf of a person without a registered eBay account or an eBay user with a suspended account, you may submit the request through our Privacy Center webform by clicking
here
, and selecting “I am a third party making a request on behalf of a data subject.”
You will need to provide Proof of Identity (POI) and Proof of Address (POA) for the consumer on whose behalf you are submitting the request and proof that you are authorized to act on their behalf. Only after verifying both your authorization to act and proof of the requestor’s identity will we fulfill the request. Please note that for requests to know or portability, the report containing the consumer’s personal information will be sent directly to the consumer at the email address he or she uses for eBay transactions.
If the name, address, or email address you provide us for the consumer on whose behalf you are submitting the request does not match what is in our records, we will not be able to process the request.
Right to Appeal Denials.
Depending on where you live, you may also have the right to appeal if we deny certain requests. For such consumers, you may appeal a denial by following the instructions included in the denial email.
5.  Additional Information / Contact Us

5.  Your Privacy Rights
The California Privacy Laws provide various rights to California residents. These include rights to access, deletion, correction, portability, opt-out, and non-discrimination. This section provides more information about each right and how California consumers can exercise these rights. We also encourage you to visit our
Privacy Center Contact Page
for more information on your rights and our practices.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify your personal information that we collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use, and to respond to your requests. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee, or decline to act upon a request, if it is excessive or overly burdensome. If we deny your request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
For eBay to fulfill your request, you must provide sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that you are the consumer from whom we collected the personal information. The information you send for us to verify your identity will be used for this purpose only. If we are unable to verify your identity or if we suspect fraudulent activity, we may decline to comply with your request.
Right to Access (also called a “Request to Know”).
California consumers have the right to request that we disclose the personal information that we collect, use, disclose, and sell. This includes the right to request the categories of personal information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of personal information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we share or sell personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information we have collected. We try to fulfill access requests within 45 days of receiving the request. If we need more time or additional information to fulfill your request, we will write to let you know.
Right to Correct.
Subject to some exceptions, California consumers have the right to request the correction of personal information we have collected from them. Corrections made to your eBay profile will be made immediately. Correction requests submitted through a webform may take up to 45 days to fulfill. If we need more time or additional information to fulfill your request, we will write to let you know.
Right to Delete.
Subject to some exceptions, California consumers have the right to request the deletion of the personal information we have collected from them. Deletion requests may take between 30 and 60 days to fulfill (depending on whether you have recently sold on eBay as we must meet our commitment under
eBay’s Money Back Guarantee policy
). If we need more time or additional information to fulfill your request, we will write to let you know.
Right to Portability.
Under certain circumstances and to the extent technically feasible, California consumers have the right to receive personal information we hold about them in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format so that you can provide that personal information to another entity. When you make a request to know specific pieces of information, the report we will provide will be in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
Right to Opt Out of Sale.
You have the right to opt-out of the Sale of your personal information. “Sale” is defined broadly under California Privacy Laws to include the transfer of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, which includes practices common among online marketplaces.
Right to Opt Out of Sharing.
You have the right to opt-out of the Sharing of your personal information. “Share” is defined under the California Privacy Laws to include the transfer of personal information to third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Like many online marketplaces, we use cookies, pixels, and similar technology, and we Share certain information, such as your IP address or device identifiers, to certain third-party advertisers in order to improve your user experience and to optimize our marketing activities. You have the right to direct us not to Share or use your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Please note that you may still receive generalized ads after opting out of targeted advertising.
Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information.
To the extent your sensitive personal information (as that term is defined under California Privacy Laws) is used to infer characteristics about you, you have the right to direct us to stop such processing of your sensitive personal information for such purposes. eBay does not use your sensitive personal information to infer characteristics about you or limits its use to purposes authorized by CPRA Section 1798.121(a).

UK Credit Reference Notice
Effective date: April 8, 2024
This UK Credit Reference Notice is provided as a supplement to our
User Privacy Notice
and includes information relating to our use of credit reference agencies in the UK.
Where you apply to use our marketplace or payments services, we may check your details with a fraud prevention agency/agencies and credit reference agencies. If you give false or inaccurate information and we identify fraud, this will be recorded and may be shared by those agencies with other organisations and us, so that we and those other organisations, including law enforcement agencies and debt collection agencies, may access, use and search these records to:
(a) help make decisions about credit and credit related services, for you and members of your household;
(b) help make decisions on motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims, for you and members of your household;
(c) trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud, and to manage your accounts or insurance policies;
(d) prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:
Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;
Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities;
Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; and
Checking details of job applicants and employees.
Please contact us through our
webform
if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.
More information about credit reference agencies, their role as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, for how long, your rights and how they use personal data is available at the following links to each agency’s Credit Reference Agency Information Notice:

TransUnion:

Any credit reference agency whose records we search will keep a record of any search, and lenders may use it to assess applications they receive from you in the future.
You acknowledge that credit reference agencies link together the records of you and anyone that you have advised is a financial associate (e.g. someone with whom you have a joint credit account) including previous and subsequent names of parties to the account. Links between financial associates will remain on your, and their, credit reference files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the credit reference agencies. When assessing the affordability of your repayments, we may take into account information about your financial associates in your credit reference.
