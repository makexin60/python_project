This Privacy Policy outlines how Craveo Labs Private Limited ("Craveo", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects user data.
Craveo, operated by Craveo Labs Private Limited, operates as an advanced tool designed to assist users in finding the best deals by comparing prices across food delivery platforms. It retains encrypted forms of personal information such as user names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and third-party authentication details. Additionally, Craveo stores user avatars and names from Google-Authentication to personalize the user experience.
As an advanced automation tool, Craveo may create an account on the desired platform that the user intends to connect, if such an account does not already exist, utilizing the provided phone number.
This privacy policy thoroughly outlines the disclosure of all accessed, utilized, and shared data, encompassing both personal and sensitive information, within the context of an automation tool in the price comparison domain of food delivery apps.
Craveo gathers and employs specific categories of cart and user data essential for automating price comparisons across various platforms on behalf of the user. This includes necessary tokens and IDs to retrieve addresses and construct carts across connected platforms.
Users provide consent to Craveo for using OTPs during the account connection process for authentication purposes.
Craveo stores credential tokens securely in an encrypted manner to protect user information.
Craveo integrates only with platforms that users have authorized, utilizing user-provided data like addresses and personal details to enhance the user experience.
As an automation tool, Craveo may transfer user-provided addresses from connected platforms to ensure a unified app experience when the address is not present on that specific platform. It is important to note that Craveo functions solely as an automation tool and users retain full control over their data and its sharing within Craveo.
Craveo requests certain user permissions to enable cart sharing through the Craveo overlay bubble. Screen content is accessed only when the user actively interacts with the overlay bubble. Data is transmitted to the backend for processing solely if it is identified as a cart page; otherwise, the screen data is immediately discarded locally on the user's device, ensuring minimal and purposeful data usage.
Users acknowledge that there could be the possibility of final prices on Craveo not consistently reflecting accuracy, owing to dynamic pricing adjustments made by third-party platforms.
Craveo solely facilitates the users automated price comparison behaviour and does not alter or manipulate information sourced from third-party platforms. Consequently, Craveo explicitly disclaims responsibility for pricing errors and advises users to independently verify prices directly on the respective third-party platforms.
Craveo employs industry-standard security measures to protect all personal and sensitive user data. This includes the encryption of stored credential tokens and the implementation of secure data transmission protocols.
Craveo does not share user information with third parties except as necessary for the functioning of the platform and as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
The types of personal and sensitive user data shared may include phone numbers and addresses with third-party food delivery platforms for the purpose of integrating and accessing services on behalf of the user.
Craveo retains user data for the duration necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Users may request the deletion of their account and associated data by contacting Craveo's support team at

Craveo regularly reviews and deletes user data that is no longer required for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Craveo Labs Private Limited reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy as needed. Users will be informed of any changes, and continued use of the platform implies acceptance of the updated policy.
