§ 1 Scope
1.1 BBG allows users to use the app within its existing technical and operational bounds. BBG provides all of its services in connection with the app based exclusively on the Terms of Use described here as well as other conditions, insofar as these additional conditions are referred to in these Terms of Use.
1.2 BBG does not recognize the validity of any general terms and conditions or any of the user’s other conditions. Any general terms and conditions or other conditions of the user shall only become an integral part of the contract if confirmed by BBG in writing.
1.3 BBG may utilize the services of independent third parties (hereinafter called „
third party service(s)
„), such as the App Store and social networks, for the app. Third party services are not services from third parties that provide the service under the direction of BBG. Third party services are not services of BBG. They shall be identified accordingly by BBG or the third party. Questions that may arise in connection with third party services are not affected by these Terms of Use. BBG is not responsible for third party services. Third party services may possibly be subject to the general terms and conditions of their provider.
§ 2 Authorized Users
2.1 The app that is provided by BBG is exclusively geared to consumers. Use of the app for commercial purposes is not permitted. Participation in the app is solely for the purpose of entertainment.
2.2 Only those users who are over the age of 18 or have the explicit permission of a parent or legal guardian are entitled to use our services.
2.3 By making use of the app, the user expressly acknowledges his/her full legal age and legal capacity. In the case of minors, the user expressly asserts the consent of his/her parent(s) or legal guardian. BBG is entitled, but not required, to request documentation at any time that the user has reached full legal age or has the consent of his/her parent(s) or legal guardian.
2.4 Once a minor uses the app after reaching the age of majority, all of the contracts and agreements in connection with this account that were concluded before reaching full legal age shall be deemed accepted, provided the user does not revoke his/her acceptance from BBG within two weeks of reaching full legal age.
§ 3 Formation of contracts
3.1 Downloading and installation of the app from the App Store is required to use the app. To do this, an existing account must be used or a new one created for the App Store. By downloading the app from the App Store, the user receives a personal, timely, non-exclusive, unrestricted, non-transferable license to install the app on a mobile device. The license applies to all of the mobile devices that are connected with the App Store account.
3.2 Furthermore, to use the app it may be necessary that the user be logged on to services for example from Apple, Google, Amazon or Microsoft as the manufacturer of the mobile device as well as the developer of the mobile device’s operating system.
3.3 The user can read these Terms of Use in the App Store and print them out or store them to a durable storage medium before downloading the app.
3.4 The formation and fulfillment of contracts, especially those regarding the purchase of the app and/or premium features for real money, shall also be subject to the terms and conditions of the App Store, see § 5.1 and § 5.3 of these Terms of Use.
§ 4 Limits to use / prohibited behaviors
4.1 BBG provides the app only for use in accordance with these Terms of use.
4.2 The user is not entitled to use measures, mechanisms or software in connection with the app that may affect or interfere with the function or the operation of the app. The user shall not take measures that may cause an unreasonable or excessive burden on the technical capacity of BBG. In particular, the user shall not be permitted to block, overwrite or modify contents generated by BBG without the express written consent of BBG.
4.3 The user shall not be permitted to add elements to the app or change, delete or modify elements of the app in any other form without the explicit prior consent of BBG. In particular, the user shall not be permitted to copy, export or otherwise use graphic elements or try to decompile the app’s source code. This shall not apply if decompiling is permitted by law in accordance with § 69e of the German Copyright Act (
Urhebergesetz
,
UrhG
).
4.4 The user may under no circumstances use any aids that influence the operation of the app (such as „bots,“ „hacks“ etc.). The user shall also not offer or advertise any of these aids. The user shall, in particular, be prohibited from obtaining premium features or other advantages through the use of third party software or other applications that systematically or automatically control the app or specific functions of the app. This also applies to using program errors or bugs to the user’s own advantage („exploits“).
4.5 The user shall not insert or transmit any content with illegal or offensive contents into or within the app. This also applies to content of communications insofar as BBG enables the users to communicate with each other in the app. The same applies for the user generated display name. The user is not entitled to the allocation of a certain name. The chosen name must not infringe on the rights of third parties (in particular copyright, personal rights, trademark rights, company rights, etc.) and must not offend against good morals, e.g. hurt the religious feelings of third parties, be racist, discriminatory, pornographic, or sexist. BBG expressly disapproves of such behavior. BBG is entitled to change or delete the chosen name for technical, ethical or other reasons without the user’s approval.
4.6 The user shall not be allowed to advertise for products or programs of third parties in the app. The user shall also not make any mention of such advertising.
4.7. The user is not allowed to save, use, publish, transfer or distribute content which breaks the law or infringe any rights of third parties in the app or otherwise by using the app. The user is especially only allowed to upload content for which he own the copyright.
4.8 BBG shall be entitled to prevent non-compliance with § 4 of these Terms of Use. BBG shall also be entitled to delete the user’s content. This shall also apply if there is solid evidence of a violation of these Terms of Useor the contents are otherwise unlawful behavior. Users shall not have the right to request the recovery of deleted contents.
4.9 BBG shall be entitled to use appropriate measures and programs to uncover breaches of contractual obligations by the users, particularly to review individual actions for plausibility and compliance with § 4.1 to 4.8.
4.10 In the event of a culpable breach of his/her contractual obligations on the part of the user, particularly against § 4.1 to 4.8, BBG shall be entitled to block the user’s access to the app after a prior warning that it may block him/her. A warning is expandable, in case of a breach of his/her contractual obligations by the user in such a way, that an acceptance of the breach without further consequences than a warning would be unreasonable for BBG.
4.11 The conditions laid down in § 4 shall not limit BBG’s right to terminate a user’s access – in particular the right to terminate the contract with immediate effect – in accordance with § 11. They also shall not limit BBG’s right to enforce virtual house rules.
4.12 Settings, contacts or in-app purchases as defined in § 5.3 (collectively „
user results
„) are in most cases not bound to the installed app on the mobile device. BBG cannot ensure the same user experience when using the app over different mobile devices or mobile data connections. The app’s response time, in particular, may be worse than when using the app on land line data networks (like fixed lines via Wi-Fi).
§ 5 App purchase / premium features / data connections
5.1 The free or paid app may be downloaded and purchased in the App Store (hereinafter referred to as
„app purchase
„). App purchases are processed by the App Store. The formation and fulfillment of the contract and payment processing are determined by the App Store’s terms and conditions.
5.2 Users have the opportunity, in addition to the use of the basic version, to purchase premium features for the app from BBG for a fee. If the users purchase virtual currency, this currency can be exchanged for, among other things, various premium features. BBG shall expressly inform the users about the respective functions, requirements and prices of the premium features before they are acquired in the app.
5.3 Premium features and/or their temporary use may be purchased directly in the app (hereinafter referred to as
„in-app purchase
„). In-app purchases are processed by the App Store. The formation and fulfillment of the contract and payment processing are determined by the App Store’s terms and conditions.
5.4 Paid apps and/or premium features and/or their temporary use may be purchased using real money. The purchase of premium features and/or their temporary use using real money is only possible as an in-app purchase. The App Store terms and conditions shall apply.
5.5 The app and the premium features are not goods as defined in § 90 of the German Civil Code (
Bundesgesetzbuch
,
BGB
). BBG therefore does not transfer ownership to the premium features, but merely grants a right of use within the app. Even though the term „sell“ is used in connection with the purchase of the app and/or the premium features, it means the granting of the right of use. The terms „buyer,“ „seller,“ „sale,“ „purchase“ and similar terms have corresponding meanings. The scope and duration of the granted right of use depend on the respective app or premium feature. The right of use for the app and/or premium features shall expire at the latest when the contract between the user and BBG for the use of the app expires.
5.6 The purchase of the premium features and/or their temporary use includes the possibility to acquire these in two ways, either through one-time purchase or in different time-limited periods. In the case of conclusion a temporary use of the premium features BBG is entitled to charge the credit card or the bank account of the user with the usage fee plus any applicable sales tax. Content and prices for the temporary use resulting at the time the contract goes into effect. The contract schedule of prices and services are provided in the game at any time. The temporary use contract has the specific period which can be found in the schedule of prices and services. The period of the temporary use automatically ends with the end of the temporary use contract. If the user fails to pay its payment obligations, the temporary use ends automatically and the access to the premium features will be set back to the basic functionality.
5.7 If BBG incurs charges for return debits and/or cancellation fees due to the late cancellation of direct debits due to the fault of the user or a lack of funds to cover the charges, the user shall be responsible for the costs incurred as a result of these actions. If BBG incurs charges for return debits (for example, due to insufficient funds) due to the fault of the user, the user agrees to reimburse BBG for the incurred, proven and reasonable losses.
5.8 The user may only offset counterclaims against BBG that are undisputed or legally binding. The user may only exercise a right of retention if his/her counterclaim is based on the same contractual relationship. The assignment of the user’s claims against BBG to third parties is hereby excluded.
5.9 For the using of the app a mobile data connection is required. BBG would like to point out that using the app can sometimes, depends on the use of the app, require a high volume of data and the user may incur charges that must be paid to the provider of the mobile data connection. The prices for use of the mobile data services arise from the service descriptions of the respective mobile service provider. BBG cannot offer any assistance in this context.
§ 6 Duties and obligations of the user
6.1 The user’s main obligation is the payment of any possible fees.
6.2 BBG protects its systems from computer viruses. Nevertheless, infections with computer viruses can never be completely excluded. In addition, it is possible that unauthorized third parties may send e-mails using the name of BBG without BBG’s consent, and that these e-mails may contain computer viruses, spyware or links to web content which, in turn, may contain viruses or spyware. BBG does not have any influence on this. The user should therefore be cautious when opening all incoming messages that are sent using the name of BBG. This also applies to messages from other users.
6.3 BBG shall not be liable for damages or loss of data on the user’s mobile devices that is caused by the installation of software that does not originate from BBG.
6.4 The user undertakes to never under any circumstances use another user’s mobile device or App store account or app account, user name or password without their permission. If a third party uses one of these accounts after having gained access to the login data because the user did not sufficiently safeguard these against third party access, the user shall allow himself/herself to be treated as if he/she had accessed the account. The same applies to the use of a mobile device by a third party. If the user is not using his/her own mobile device or his/her own mobile data connection to use the app, he/she must obtain the consent of the respective owner. In this case, the user shall assure BBG that the consent has been given. BBG disclaims any liability of any unauthorized access of personal information of users by third parties (e.g. as a result of unauthorized access by “hackers”), unless such access is due to a fault on the part of BBG, e.g. by omitting protection measures.
6.5 In the event that BBG has a justifiable reason to believe that an unauthorized third party is in possession of access data, BBG may, but is not required to, at its own discretion, change the account access data without prior notice or suspend the respective account. BBG will promptly inform the user and will, upon request, communicate the new access data to them without undue delay. The user has no right to demand that the original access data be restored.
6.6 The user shall immediately notify BBG as soon as he/she becomes aware that unauthorized third parties know the login data for his/her App Store account or unauthorized third parties have used his/her mobile device. BBG would especially like to point out that login data should be changed at regular intervals for security reasons.
6.7 Users can contact BBG through the communication media and addresses listed below:
BBG Entertainment GmbH
Cuvilliésstr. 14
81679 Munich
Germany
E-Mail:
info@bbg-entertainment.com
tel: +49 (0)89 35498-100
fax: +49 (0)89 35498-499
For evidentiary reasons, BBG recommends that the user submits any important declarations (such as terminations, complaints, etc.) in writing (e.g., by e-mail), unless these Terms of Use allow for another form.
6.8 BBG would like to expressly point out that the persons responsible for customer service are not authorized to agree to changes to these Terms of Use.
6.9 The user is responsible for ensuring that his/her mobile device is maintained in a condition that allows use of the app. BBG provides system requirements and compatibility information to the best of its knowledge. Due to the large number of network operators, mobile devices and operating system versions, it is not possible for BBG to test and ensure the operability of the app in all the various constellations. BBG recommends that, in addition to the prerequisites and compatibility information published by BBG to the best of its knowledge, the user carefully read the description of the app in the App Store.
§ 7 Further developments / condition / defects
7.1 It is in the nature of the provided app that it should continuously be developed and updated. Changes may also arise from the installation of updates that ensure and improve the app’s usability. Changes and ongoing developments should offer the user the best possible entertainment fun. BBG therefore provides the user access to the app in its latest existing version. Changes and ongoing developments may affect the system requirements and compatibility requirements. The user therefore has no right to maintain or achieve a certain state (version) or functional scope of the app. Any of the user’s claims for defects that affect the usability of the app itself shall remain unaffected. Because of the continual development of the app, BBG reserves the right to offer new app and/or premium features and/or to withdraw, modify or offer them as part of the free basic version. If the user has already made advance payments for premium features and cannot use them for the above reasons or because they are also offered in the free basic version, BBG shall, depending on what the user chooses, offer other premium features for the app. In these cases, the user is free to terminate the contract with immediate effect. Any further claims by the user to this regard shall be excluded.
7.2 BBG would like to point out that the app is state of the art, but that it cannot guarantee that the app is bug-free. For this reason, the user shall expect that apps like this one do not function perfectly. BBG shall make every effort to provide an app that is as bug-free as possible to ensure complete usability. However, as with any software, minor software errors in an app cannot be entirely prevented. The app can be considered to be defective enough that the user would be entitled to assert claims based on defects if the usability of the app is seriously and constantly interrupted.
7.3 The user shall always document any possible defects in the app, especially any displayed error messages, and shall report them in writing. Before reporting an error, the user should consult help documentation provided by BBG to eliminate problems. The user shall help BBG as much as possible to correct the problems.
7.4 Errors caused by external influences, operating errors by the user, force majeure or modifications or other manipulations that were not carried out by BBG are excluded from any claims based on a defect.
7.5 BBG does not grant guarantees within the meaning of the law.
§ 8 Limitation of liability / availability
8.1 Insofar as BBG charges a fee for its services, BBG shall be liable without limitation only in the case of intentional or gross negligence. In the event of a breach of essential contractual obligations, BBG shall also be liable for minor negligence. Essential contractual obligations (also referred to as cardinal obligations within the meaning of case law) are understood to be those obligations that allow for the proper execution of the contract and rely on the fulfillment of its users.
8.2 When BBG provides services free of charge, BBG shall only be liable for damages caused intentionally or as a result of gross negligence.
8.3 The above limitations of liability shall not apply to liability for injury to life, limb and health or in the event that a guarantee has been issued by BBG or liability under the Product Liability Act. BBG’s liability within the coverage of § 44a of the Telecommunications Act (
Telekommunikationsgesetz
,
TKG
) shall remain unaffected by this.
8.4 BBG shall be liable for consulting services only insofar as the questions were related to the app.
8.5 A change in the burden of proof to the disadvantage of the user is not part of the previous provisions.
8.6 BBG warrants an annual average of 90% availability of components of the app that are not available offline. This does not include periods in which the servers for the app cannot be accessed via the Internet due to technical or other problems beyond BBG’s control (e.g., force majeure, the fault of third parties, etc.). This also does not include periods in which regular maintenance work is carried out. BBG may restrict or block access to the app to the extent that the security of network operation, maintenance of network integrity, in particular avoidance of severe disturbances of the networks, the software, or the stored data so demands; these periods shall also not be taken into consideration when calculating availability. BBG’s liability for non-availability of the server due to intentional and gross negligence shall remain unaffected. § 9 will contain more information on the liability of BBG.
§ 9 Third party contents / responsibility
BBG may provide users with a function or platform through which they can communicate with one another. The users shall be responsible for the content of these communications as well as all other contents that are published by the users. This content is considered by BBG to be third party content as defined in § 8(1) of the German Telemedia Act (
Telemediengesetz
,
TMG
). BBG does not consider the content to be its own nor does it necessarily agree with these contents. If links are published to other external web pages operated by third parties, BBG shall not be responsible for the content of the linked pages. BBG does not control these pages and expressly distances itself from their contents. If illegal contents are reported to BBG, BBG shall exercise its right to delete the content and shall immediately remove it.
§ 10 Commercial property rights and copyrights / user-generated content
10.1 The contents of the app and any websites of BBG are the sole property of BBG or the relevant licensor. The contents are protected under national and international law, and especially copyright law. The unauthorized dissemination, copying, reuse or other breach of BBG’s intellectual property rights or copyrights shall be prosecuted under civil and/or criminal law.
10.2 The user shall retain all rights to the information posted by him/her. By introducing contents into the app, the user grants BBG a non-exclusive license, at no charge and freely revocable at any time, to make these contents publicly available to third parties worldwide in the context of the app. BBG does not have any further rights of use to the information provided by the user. The license shall be terminated when the user deletes his/her content. BBG is not obligated to provide a facility for the content to be deleted.
§ 11 Term of the contract, ordinary termination of the contract / virtual domiciliary right / extraordinary termination of the contract
11.1 The contracts between the user and BBG have been concluded for an indefinite period, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
11.2 Both parties have the right to terminate the contract(s) at any time with a notice period of two weeks, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
11.3 BBG reserves the right to exercise its virtual domiciliary right at any time.
11.4 The parties‘ right to terminate the contract with immediate effect at any time shall remain unaffected by the above provisions. BBG, in particular, has the right to terminate the contract for cause if the user culpably violates laws, these Terms of Use or rules for the use of premium features and repeatedly misbehaves in the same or similar manner despite receiving warnings against such actions.
11.5 In the event of serious violations, termination with immediate effect is permitted without the need for any prior warning.
11.6 A serious violation is a violation that is so severe that BBG cannot reasonably be expected to adhere to the contract.
11.7 As a rule, BBG cannot reasonably be expected to adhere to the contract in the following cases:
When the user violates criminal laws;
When the user uses the app in an unauthorized manner (see § 4 above);
When the user provides false data when paying for premium services (see § 5).
11.8 In the event that BBG lawfully issues notice of termination for cause, BBG shall be entitled to charge an amount equivalent to 75% of the sum total of all fees the user would have had to pay during the term of the contract (including but not limited to services not yet provided by BBG, especially for virtual currency that have already been ordered) had the user terminated the contract within the set time limit. The user’s right to furnish proof that BBG has suffered no damage or considerably less damage remains unaffected. Insofar as the user has already received the service to be provided by BBG, there is no right to any refund. In particular, there shall be no refunds for virtual currency that the user has already ordered and received from BBG. Differing contract provisions belonging to the App Store shall take precedence.
11.9 BBG shall be granted an exceptional right of termination in the event that BBG loses the authority to operate the app. In this case, BBG may terminate all of the contracts relating to the operation and use of the app (such as the contract on the use of the app and/or the contract on the provision and use of premium features) with immediate effect. Other rights of termination shall remain unaffected. § 11.4 shall apply accordingly.
11.10. BBG shall be granted an exceptional right of termination in the event that BBG stops running the app. BBG may terminate all of the contracts relating to the operation and use of the app (such as the contract on the use of the app and/or the contract on the provision and use of premium features) with immediate effect. BBG will announce the date of the suspension of operations and the date up to which premium features can still be purchased 6 months in advance. Other rights of termination shall remain unaffected § 11.4 shall apply accordingly.
11.11 Notice of termination must be made in writing, whereas any message in text form shall be considered to be in compliance with the requirement of written form. The user must be informed of the reasons for the termination of the contract with immediate effect in writing at his/her request, provided they were not already stated in the notice of termination. No reasons for termination are required for ordinary termination of the contract. From the moment of deletion of user’s account further usage of the app will not be possible anymore until a new account is created.
§ 12 Changes to the Terms of Use
12.1 BBG reserves the right to change or expand on these Terms of Use with effect for the future at any time if it appears to be necessary and provided that it does not adversely affect the user under the principle of equity and good faith. A change may be especially necessary in order to make adjustments due to a change in the legal situation. New court decisions are also considered to be a change in the legal situation. Changes and further development of the app may also necessitate a change or addition to the Terms of Use.
12.2 Any changes or additions shall be announced in an appropriate manner in text form at least one month prior to the effective date of the change or addition.
12.3 The user shall have the right to object to the change or addition with BBG within one month from the publication of this notice. In the event of an objection in good time, both parties have the right to terminate the contract with immediate effect in accordance with this contract’s provisions on termination. Other rights of termination shall remain unaffected. If the user does not object to the change or addition within the stipulated period or he/she continues to use the services, the change or addition shall be deemed accepted and become part of the contract.
12.4 In its notice regarding the changes to the Terms of Use, BBG shall expressly point out the opportunity to object to changes and to terminate the contract, the time limit and the legal consequences, including but not limited to those relating to non-objection.
§ 13 Final provisions
13.1 If one party hesitates to enforce, delays or sets aside his or her rights under these Terms of Use or grants the other party time, these rights shall remain unaffected.
13.2 The users shall not be entitled to transfer their rights under this contractual relationship to third parties. This shall not apply if BBG has approved it in writing beforehand.
13.3 BBG will, failing an agreement to the contrary in the Terms of Use or any other agreement, usually get in contact with the user by e-mail. The user will ensure that e-mail messages from BBG reach him at the e-mail address he has specified during registration or subsequently submitted (changed) to BBG. The user is responsible for choosing and maintaining spam filter settings and for regularly checking all incoming e-mail sent to this address. Apart from that, BBG reserves the right to use another form of communication.
13.4 The contracts concluded based on these Terms of Use and all related claims shall be exclusively governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany; the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply.
13.5 Should individual provisions of these Terms of Use be or become invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.
13.6 Any amendments and additions to this usage contract as well as supplementary agreements must be in writing in order to be legally valid. This also applies to any changes to the requirement for written form. The requirement for written form does not apply to changes to these Terms of Use.

info@bbg-entertainment.com
(hereinafter “BBG”), respects your right for privacy. BBG always endeavors to offer you an outstanding service for all products and services. In addition, BBG would like to provide Users of the offering with supplemental information concerning the handling of personal data by means of this Privacy Policy.
Of course, BBG will treat all personal data that a User transmits in the course of the business relationship in compliance with the applicable data protection provisions. The details about how BBG handles personal data can be found in this Privacy Policy.
1.  Scope of application
This Privacy Policy is applicable to all websites operated by BBG as well as all BBG apps that can be loaded via the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon App Store Windows/Windows Phone Store, or other App Stores(“offering”) and is oriented towards Users of this offering (“Users”).
If other BBG offerings have differing privacy policies, the differing privacy policy published on the respective website or in the respective offering shall apply. The BBG offering might contain cross-references („links“) to other websites or offerings of third-party providers. By clicking on such a link, Users sometimes leave the websites or offerings of BBG and reach the websites or offerings of third parties, for which content, compliance with data protection or privacy policy, BBG assumes no responsibility. The processing of Users’ personal data is executed by the third party operating the website and offering the service. In particular, BBG is not responsible that the same data protection standards that are observed by BBG do apply on websites or offerings not operated by BBG. BBG has no influence on that process. This also applies to personal data entered by the User on third party websites or offerings which come through to BBG, e.g. when entering BBG’s Facebook profile. For this reason, Users should carefully read through the privacy policies of third party websites and offerings.
2. Personal data
“Personal data” are individual details about personal or objective circumstances of a specific or determinable natural person.These data include name, mailing address, birth date and gender as well as information through the use of the offering, e.g. game and exercise results and individual high scores the User achieves.
Information that the User provides to other Users via the offering of BBG (e.g. photos, chat-contents) may also constitute personal data.
3.
Collecting and Use of Data, Google Analytics, Social Plugins and Advertising
3.1
Data Processing when using the Offering and Downloading the App
3.1.1
Data processing and logging for internal system purposes and statistical purposes
BBG’s system automatically records information during the visit to and use of BBG’s offering which BBG uses to in case it is required to enable the use and recording of the offering, so called usage data. This might include data such as browser type, browser language, operating system of the device used, display resolution, language and time zone settings, User’s geographical origin, date and time of the visit, access time or the address of the pages visited, and potentially the User’s IP address and the domains from which the User is accessing BBG’s offering.
IP addresses serve the purpose of the clear identification of the computers which are connected with the Internet. The location of the computer can also be derived from this. The IP address is transmitted with each server enquiry so that the server knows where the answer has to be sent to. The IP address is allocated to each user of an Internet-Service-Provider (ISP) as soon as he connects with the Internet. The ISP can understand which IP address at which time was allocated to which of its customers. As long as the IP address is stored there, it is theoretical possible to determine the identity of the connection holder via the ISP. BBG stores the IP address of the User which he possesses during his registration, when logging in, when placing an order as well as in the event of the deactivation of the user account.

3.9.1 Information about the BBG Service per email
If Users declare their permission to use and process their email address, BBG will send the desired information to the respective Users, usually in the form of newsletters or invitations to participate in special offers or competitions.
In order to send newsletters or other information to Users per email (“Newsletter-Service”) BBG needs at least one valid email address of the User.
For the registration to the Newsletter-Service BBG uses the so-called double-opt-in procedure. In this procedure Users will only receive newsletters or other information after they have clicked on a special link for confirmation, which will be sent to their email address after their registration for the Newsletter-Service. This procedure should guarantee, that the respective User is the owner of the submitted email address.

If and insofar as BBG uses User data for creating User profiles it shall discontinue the usage if this is objected to by the respective Users. BBG uses data not anonymized nor aggregated based on article 6, paragraph 1, page 1 lit f) GDPR. BBG’s justified interest is to improve and develop the offering, products and services, of BBG
.

Parts of the offering may also be apps and software („Professional Solutions“), which are licensed to a licensee (e.g. medical personnel) to be used by the licensee’s customers (“End User”).
In that case, personal data are entered when setting up a User profile for the End User based on the data provided by the End User as well as further personal data (e.g. predetermined user name, e-mail address and the password for the User profile, registration date, date and time of logins). Transmitting these personal data is neither mandated legally nor is it a prerequisite to entering into a contract.
In addition, when using the Professional Solutions, personal usage data as mention under number #2 are being recorded (e.g. browser type, browser language, operating system of the device used, display resolution, language and time zone settings, users’ geographic location, date and time of last visit, time at accessing the site, visiting time and URLs of sites visited, possibly users’ IP address and domain from which Users access the BBG offering, information on the usage of the offering including exercise and game results as well as individual high scores by user).
On a case by case basis, the licensee may transmit additional personal data of the End User to BBG.
The logging and processing of all aforementioned personal data of the End User is executed as per the licensee’s briefing for the purposes stated by the licensee. Legal basis for logging and processing End Users’ personal data by BBG is article 6, paragraph 1, page 1 lit b) GDPR, whereas BBG is being active as the licensee’s provider of the job order as per article 28 GDPR. The legal basis for the logging and procession of Users’ personal is being determined by the licensee; only the licensee is responsible for this. For further information regarding the legal basis, one can inquire with the licensee.
Besides that, BBG will use personal data of the End User and those of the licensee regarding the usage of the Professional Solution only in an anonymized and aggregated form, without there being the option to trace them back to individuals. BBG will use the data only for its own purposes, in particular to calculate statistics being available as consulting information to the licensee and to optimize the Professional Solution and other offerings.
4. Data integrity and security
BBG endeavors to achieve a level of correctness of the stored personal data of Users that is corresponding to the current standards. For this purpose, BBG will take a precautionary measure by allowing individual persons reasonable access to the stored personal data of Users in order to check, correct or anonymize (if necessary), block or delete such data. Within the framework of BBG’s offering Users also have the opportunity, following authentication, to independently inspect and/or modify the data they have transmitted.
The protection of personal data that BBG has received from Users of the offering is an important component of the company philosophy of BBG. BBG protects personal data of Users of offerings of BBG against loss, abuse and modification by means of modern security measures of a physical, technical and administrative nature. All servers are hosted by BBG or selected partners, who can ensure the same data security as BBG and are obliged to comply with data protection law.
As is the case with all transmissions of data via the Internet, however, a residual risk also remains in the case of sending and receiving personal data.
BBG points out to Users that, in spite of the stringent requirements BBG places on data protection, all information that a User voluntarily releases via the Internet can also potentially be used by others. For this reason, BBG cannot assume any responsibility or liability for the disclosure of information as a result of errors in data transmission and/or unauthorized access by third parties.
5.
User Rights
Each User has the right to inquire and receive information about their personal data being stored. More detail is available under number 6.
Each User has the right to the correction, blocking and deletion of his personal data in accordance with the statutory provisions. If the User does not undertake any amendment or deletion himself, BBG as well as the person responsible for the Privacy Policy at BBG are available at the address stated at the end of this Privacy Policy and are happy to receive corresponding applications. BBG will appropriately amend or, as the case may be, delete Users’ personal data of BBG’s offering as quickly as possible. BBG points out that, due to technical and organizational conditions, it is possible that, even after the request for amendment or deletion, some measures will still be carried out that have already begun, but have not yet been completely executed, after Users notified BBG of the request for deletion. BBG likewise points out, however, that deletion of User data is only possible if it is not precluded by legal provisions, particularly with respect to data storage timelines, data for billing and/or bookkeeping purposes.
Each User is at liberty at all times to object to the processing and use of his personal data for purposes of direct marketing and data analyses, which are based on article 6, paragraph 1, page 1 lit f) GDPR. In the instance of the last stated case, this applies only if BBG cannot prove reasons worthy of protection for processing, which outweigh the User’s interests, rights and freedom of choice or which are designed to claim, execute or defend legal claims (article 21, paragraph 1, GDPR).
In particular, Users can object to the use of their e-mail address for the receipt of newsletters and/or information of BBG at all times without cause and without incurring transmission cost for this purpose other than the delivery cost to convey the objection (at basic rates). BBG will clearly point out their right to objection to its Users both when collecting the email address as well as with each use in newsletters or other information.
If Users provide data concerning them and BBG processes these data based on Users’ consent, Users can demand to have BBG transmit the data to them in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or that these data are transmitted to another named responsible as far as that is technically feasible (so called Right of Transferring Data).
Each User consent to the use of his personal data can be freely revoked by the User at any point in time effective as of the time is was revoked.
In addition, the User can file a complaint against the data processing with the overseeing authorities if he believes it to be violating current law.

In these cases, the disclosure and the possible transmission to maintain aforementioned justified interest of BBG based on article 6, paragraph 1, page 1 lit f) GDPR may be required, and therefore legal.
7.
Time to Storage

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls

For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:
Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like
Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.
Legal bases of processing
We process your information for the
purposes
described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
We process your data in order to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at

For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

X Privacy Policy
Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:
X is a public platform

We collect some data

Affiliate services may have their own policies

We use your data to make X better

10. How To Contact X
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us.
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
Personal Accounts.
If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
Professional Accounts.
If you create a
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.
Payment Information.
In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
Preferences.
When you set your preferences using your
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
Biometric Information.
Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.
Job Applications / Recommendations.
We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your activity on X, including:
Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.
We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).
Purchase and payments.
To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
Device Information.
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:
Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.
Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.
Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information.
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.
Inferred Identity.
We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:
When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.
When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.
Log Information.
We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:
IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identiﬁers; and identiﬁers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.
Advertisements.
When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).
Cookies and similar technologies.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.
3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android.

5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether
videos you upload
are downloadable by others.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates
and third-party partners and
service providers
located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.
X is a
participant
in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us
here
. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body
JAMS
, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in
Annex 1
to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF
