CCP Games UK Limited, United Kingdom;
CCP Information Technology (Shanghai) Co. Limited, People’s Republic of China; and
Pearl Abyss Corporation, Republic of Korea.
Disclosure Within The Game
Character names and in-game activities are available to other Players within the Game. Members of your corporation may also have access to greater amount of your in-game activities than others.
If you have published data on message boards, forums and chats within a Game, such information is also available to other players.
Disclosure To Third Parties
Data Processors And Suppliers Of Services
CCP may disclose your personal data to third party contractors, consultants and suppliers in relation to their work for us. Personal data may for example be disclosed to external parties which provide us with IT services and third parties which assist us in administering, operating, maintaining and supporting the Services, based on our legitimate interests of outsourcing such services. This includes data storage providers, software providers and players’ support providers. We ensure that these third parties process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy based on a specific data processing agreement.
Payment Service Providers
In the event you make a payment on our Websites through a payment service provider, we may transfer your contact details, that is name, address and e-mail address, to the applicable payment service provider, where it is necessary for the execution of payment.
Advertising Partners
CCP shares Players’ e-mail addresses and hashed user-IDs with CCP’s marketing agency which manages the Company’s marketing campaigns on all channels CCP uses for marketing purposes – such as Google, Facebook, Twitter etc. CCP’s marketing agency, acting as a data processor on CCP’s behalf, shares e-mail addresses and hashed user-IDs with the platforms for marketing purposes and in certain limited circumstances CCP shares the player’s e-mail addresses and hashed user IDs with the platforms directly, depending on the marketing campaign. The transfer of the limited data is based on CCP’s legitimate interests for marketing purposes, as this allows us to reach individuals who have played our Games, or those with similar interests. These third parties are not allowed to use the data for any other purposes.
In relation to marketing purposes, CCP also uses a data processor for sending out marketing e-mails to Players on its behalf.
You can always opt-out of the transfer of your e-mail address to third parties by contacting the Data Protection Team.
Third Party Developers
On the basis of Players’ consent, third party developers can obtain in-game data. On the Community Site, you can view and revoke third-party applications' access you have consented to.
Law Enforcement and governmental officials
CCP may disclose your personal data to law enforcement or other government officials, as CCP, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible crimes or to respond to judicial, regulatory, agency or similar inquiries. Disclosure may also be necessary in emergency situations and to ensure the rights and safety of Customers, CCP staff or third parties.
Ownership Changes
If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services changes, we may share your data during negotiations or in preparation for a change of control or other acquisition, and and transfer your personal data to the new owner, as applicable.
Eve Swagger Interface – Publicly Available In Game Data
Via the EVE Swagger Interface (“ESI”), CCP provides public access to a limited dataset, solely linked to Players’ character names. Under no circumstances can third parties thus use ESI to obtain information about players. No account data or user-level data is shared with third-party developers via ESI. Since character and in-game data made available via ESI cannot be linked to a specific player, the data available via ESI is not considered personal data under EU data protection regulations.
Aggregated Information
We may collect aggregated demographic information about our users, such as age, interests, etc. We may share certain aggregated demographic information with our partners regarding the users of the Services. The aggregated information that we provide is not directly linked to you or any other identifiable person and is therefore not considered personal data.
International Transfer Of Data
The data we collect from you may be transferred to, stored and processed by CCP companies at one or more destinations both inside and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including the Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of China for any purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
Our contractors, consultants and suppliers may also be located outside the EEA.
However, we only transfer your personal data to countries outside the EEA if such transfer is permitted under the applicable privacy legislation. The transfer to CCP companies outside of the EEA is based on Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission.
E. How long do we keep Customers' data?
Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we are committed to retaining your personal data only for as long as it is necessary for you to use our Services or until you request to have your personal data deleted, whichever comes first.
If you request to have your personal data deleted, we will delete your personal data from your Player Account, which will render other data, such as Gaming Data, anonymous and non-traceable to you as an individual. The user generated content that you have created, such as your avatar, messages in chat rooms, on bulletin boards and other user-to-user areas may not be deleted, but you will not be associated with that content after the deletion of your Player Account personal data.
Data regarding permanent suspension of a player is kept for an unlimited period, as the player is permanently suspended from parts of our Services. In such cases, Player Account data cannot be deleted, as it is necessary for CCP to keep a record of the ban in order to prevent the player from accessing specific Services again.
We may keep your personal data for longer for research or statistical purposes. If we do, we will make sure your personal data is anonymised and non-traceable to you as a person. We may also keep your personal data for longer if required to do so for legal or regulatory reasons.

We may share your personal data with contractors, consultants and other third parties who require such data to assist us with managing our relationship with you. Third parties who provide us with information technology and data processing services may also have access to your data, as necessary.
These third parties may be established outside the EEA. However, we only transfer your personal data to countries outside the EEA if such transfer is permitted under applicable privacy legislation.
Your personal data may also be disclosed to third parties as permitted or required by applicable law.
