3. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyze use, target advertisements, and prevent fraud. The technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your device. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly. This automatic collection may include:
i. Cookies (or browser cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Service. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Service.
ii. Web Beacons. Pages of our Service may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
iii. GPS (global positioning systems) software and other precise location-based technologies to locate you so we may verify your location, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as allow you to share your location with other players as part of the services we provide via the Service. Upon you downloading the App, we provide location-based technologies to determine your approximate and/or exact location information. In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, we or some of our partners and others we work with may utilize low-power Bluetooth, wifi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the App can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise interact with the App. Because such precise location-based technologies are more precise than GPS, we can improve the Service and App such as to send you more specific and relevant messages and offers. In addition, you may be able to send your location information via the Service to other Service users. You should consider the pros and cons involved in disclosing your location information to us and to others. Where a user of the Service requests that their location information be revealed to other persons, the user will be provided options for managing sharing services, which may be through third-party services such as through social media networks. We are not responsible for the acts, omissions or policies of such third parties.
4. Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Service are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers.

The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers, see ‘Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information.’
