This Privacy Notice describes practices regarding the processing of personally identifiable information (“PII”) and Protected Health Information (“PHI”) (collectively, “Personal Information”) by Modivcare Inc., Modivcare Solutions, LLC, and Modivcare Solutions’ divisions and subsidiaries (collectively, “Modivcare”) in connection with all of Modivcare’s website(s) and associated subdomains and related applications (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Notice does not apply to the processing of certain employment-related information.
1. Collection of Personal Information
Modivcare may collect the following types of information:
Information you provide to Modivcare in connection with your use of the Services, such as through online forms, requests to receive alerts, registration forms, surveys, email communications, and other online avenues including, but not limited to, name, address, email address, phone number, demographic information, and feedback.
Information that is automatically collected when you use the Services, including, but not limited to home server domain name, internet protocol (IP) address, geolocation data, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, type of Web browser, and aggregate and user-specific information regarding user activity.
TRACKING PRACTICES
Modivcare may place cookies on the hard drives of users of the Services. Cookies save data about individual users, such as the user’s name, username, screen preferences, and user activity. When a user revisits the Services, Modivcare may recognize the user by the cookie and customize the user’s experience accordingly.
You may disable or delete browser cookies through your browser settings. Cookies are generally easy to disable or delete, but the method varies between browsers. If you disable or delete cookies, or if you are running third-party software that intercepts or deletes cookies, please note that some parts of our Services may not work properly.
Modivcare also may use web bugs (i.e., web beacons) to gather, store, and track certain information related to user visits to and activity on the Services. A web bug is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, that is placed on a web page or in an email message to monitor user activity. A web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of a user’s computer, the time the web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.
