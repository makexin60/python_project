Method for Prioritizing Updates
Vulnerabilities are classified based on industry-standard severity ratings, such as
CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
:
Critical
(CVSS 9.0-10.0): Patches are applied immediately, with systems updated within
24-48 hours
of detection or availability.
High
(CVSS 7.0-8.9): Updates are prioritized within
5 business days
.
Medium
(CVSS 4.0-6.9): Updates are addressed within
30 days
, depending on the potential impact.
Low
(CVSS 0.1-3.9): Addressed during routine maintenance cycles.
Internal risk assessments determine the urgency, considering the potential impact on systems handling sensitive data.

Browsers and other applications used in development are updated immediately upon receiving vendor notifications of security patches.
Monthly audits are conducted to verify compliance and detect missed updates.
