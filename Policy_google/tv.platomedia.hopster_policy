The data we collect about you
Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual which can identify that individual. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you, which we have grouped together into the following categories:
Contact Data
includes any email address which you might provide to us, for example when logging in.
Technical Data
includes your login data, time zone setting and location, operating system and platform, device identifiers including device ID and advertising ID and other technology on the devices you or your child use to access the Hopster applications.
Profile Data
for example, your password.
Usage Data
includes information about how you use the Hopster applications. Please note that this may include personal data relating to your child’s use of the Hopster apps e.g. records of which puzzles have been successfully solved.
Please note that any processing of financial data is carried out by the payment provider chosen by the user e.g. iTunes, Google Play etc. As such, Hopster apps do not collect, store or have access to any financial data.
We also collect, use and – where necessary to provide the Hopster services – we might share what we will call Aggregated Data. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data (using the definition above) to calculate how many subscribers are using a particular feature of the Hopster mobile apps. If we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, then we treat the combined data as personal data – which will always be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We do not collect any data which is not necessary to provide the Hopster services to you.

If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Hopster apps and website may become inaccessible or not function properly. Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences. Our cookies themselves do not contain any personal data. Our cookies may reference the personal data you provided during registration. We reference the information you provided via an encrypted identifier. Where we link these unique identifiers with your personal information, we will treat the unique identifiers as personal data as long as they are linked. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate Hopster apps and services. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your internet browser’s “help” file. When your kids use Hopster apps, we collect certain non-personal information by placing and accessing Hopster apps cookies on the device they are using. Cookies do not contain any personal data, so we do not use cookies (or other covert or non-consensual methods) to acquire contact information about your kids or other users of the device.
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that that we need to use it for another purpose which is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will let you know and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that where we have to carry our processing where required by the law, we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent.

We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. We may share personal information collected with the companies within the Sandbox International Holdings Ltd. We will not share any personal information about you with any third party (a party not affiliated with Sandbox International Holdings Ltd.), except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy and in the following circumstances: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws; (c) when disclosure is directed or consented to by the registered member who has inputted the personal information; (d) in the event that Sandbox International Holdings Ltd.

International transfers
Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (
EEA
) – which is all EU member countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. So, their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we make sure that similar levels of protection are in place. Below are some examples of how we do this:
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts which may have been approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
Please contact us if you would like further information regarding the transfer of your personal data out of the EEA.
Data security
We have put in place security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Additionally, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Data retention
How long will you use my personal data for?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
