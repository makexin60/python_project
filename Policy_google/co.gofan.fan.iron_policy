In some cases, you may be entitled under local laws to access or object to the processing of information that we hold relating to you.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our Services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases

For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.

You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe
. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.

Once we share your Personal Data with Business Users, we may process that Personal Data as a Data Processor for those Business Users, as detailed in Section 1.2 of this Policy.  You should consult the privacy policies of the Business Users’ you do business with for information on how they use the information shared with them.
Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention
. We use your Personal Data collected across our Services to detect fraud and prevent financial losses for you, us, and our Business Users and Financial Partners, including detecting unauthorized purchases.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center
, including the

Transaction Data

Identity/Verification Information
. Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that our Business Users can use to verify Personal Data about you, such as your authorization to use a particular payment method. During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Customers, including about your online activity, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers
To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use and share End Customers' Personal Data with them.

During payment transactions, your Personal Data is shared with various entities in connection with your transaction.

Please review your merchant’s, bank’s, and payment method provider’s privacy policies for more information about how they use and share your Personal Data.
Financial services
. Certain Business Users leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via Stripe or our Financial Partners. For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User. In addition to any Transaction Data we may generate or receive when these cards are used for purchases, we also collect and use your Personal Data to provide and manage these products, including assisting our Business Users in preventing misuse of the cards. Please review the privacy policies of the Business User and, if applicable, our bank partners associated with the financial service (the brands of which may be shown on the card) for more information.
Identity/Verification services
. We use Personal Data about your identity to perform verification services for Stripe or for the Business Users that you are transacting with, to prevent fraud, and to enhance security.

The Business Users you choose to do business with may further share your Personal Data with third parties (like additional third party service providers other than Stripe). Please review the Business User’s privacy policy for more information.
Advertising by Business Users

What we do
How does Stripe protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse we use security measures to comply with federal law.  These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.  We impose access controls along with ongoing monitoring to prevent data misuse, and we require our service providers to take similar steps to protect your information.
How does Stripe collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
• open a Link account;
• ask Stripe to process a payment for goods or services;
• provide bank account information to Stripe using Financial Connections

Why can’t I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
• sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
• affiliates from using your information to market to you
• sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you.
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See the Other Important Information section below for more information on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.

Last Updated March 19, 2024
Introduction
Extole, Inc. (“Extole”, “us” or “we”) offers a referral, advocacy, and analytics platform enabling brands (our “Clients”)–whether those brands use websites or “apps,” and across different types of devices–to allow their end users’ (“Users”) to share, refer, and engage on those website and devices with content, and to derive additional insights into how their Users experience the brand. Extole recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and secure data and  describes your rights in determining what we do with the information that we collect or hold about you.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts, and is intended to meet requirements globally, including those in North America, Europe, APAC, and other jurisdictions:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how information is collected about our Clients’ Users, and used, by Extole in connection with the provision of our products and services (the “Extole Services” or the “Services”).
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website: This section explains how information is collected and used by us from our website visitors through our website located at www.extole.com (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at my.extole.com. If you are a Client using our Extole dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Extole Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Extole Collect from Our Services?
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Extole Services: Overview
Extole provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients deliver content, including rewards and links, to their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices, and applications so that Users can share content, links, and rewards with one another. Extole helps Clients by providing analytics to Clients. This information is used by the Client to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences.
Extole has no direct relationship with Users. Extole’s Services are provided when Extole Clients install on their platforms “Extole Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture the User action on behalf of the Client. By associating the information collected from these Mechanisms, Extole creates and stores identifiers unique to individual clients in the Extole platform, and then uses a variety of techniques to connect these User actions and identifiers together. Some of these common connection techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform. These techniques help Clients match Users and issue rewards based on those matches. Extole stores this information separately for each Client program and does combine specific actions and information about individuals between different Client programs.
The key use cases of Extole’s service are:
To support Clients in implementing refer-a-friend programs typically using rewards based on key events such as purchase.
For example, Extole helps a Client create and deliver a sharing UI on a Clients website or app so that Users can create links and send them to other Users in email, over social networks, and directly to recommend purchase or sign-up. Extole tracks the events in this referral process and helps Clients deliver reward to Users.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s referral and advocacy initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Extole can tell a Client how many Users shared, visited their website, registered for their service, and/or purchased. Extole can also tell a Client about the rewards issued as a result of those events.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted offers and content to their Users depending on Client determined criteria in order to deliver more relevant referral and advocacy content and rewards.
For example, a Client can use Extole Mechanisms to provide a tailored reward like a coupon code in the Client’s website to users who have interacted with the Client’s app and/or website in the past.
Extole requires that each Client commit to share with Extole only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users, or from their parents for children under 13, or in certain jurisdictions such as the European Union, under 16), and that it has the right to share with Extole, and we strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information that is not necessary for the provision of the Services.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Extole Links, Pixels, and Tags
Extole collects the following information from web URLs created by the Client and Users and from pixels and tags placed by the Client on its websites. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“Personal Data”).
Type of Information Collected
Purpose
IP Address
Standard web HTTP request; used for matching
Cookie
Standard web cookies, used for matching
Link Data
Metadata controlled by the Client, which may be used to interpret the data for reporting, or for analytics
User Agent
Standard web browser user agent metadata; used for matching
Referrer
Standard web browser HTTP referrer; may be used for reporting and analytics
Request
Standard web HTTP request
Address Book Information
Clients may allow Users in a sharing UI to connect their address books from Google, Yahoo, and other providers in order to simplify sharing by Users.
Extole will only collect the first name, last name, and email address of the individual(s) Users select from their address books in order to:
Personalize share messages;
Deliver the share or referral message on that platform;
Support accurate recognition of a referral in order to provide rewards depending on the rules of the Client program.
How Does Extole Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Data Extole collects through the Services is processed:
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Extole Services.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Extole does not control how Clients use information Extole shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Extole.
to analyze and aggregate Client data with data of other Clients for Extole’s own internal business purposes and as permitted by applicable law.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot be linked back to any individual person or Client, and share these reports with the public.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Our Clients use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ brand experience and to better understand their marketing programs and how Users experience their brand and products. For example, a User may want to share information about a retailer that she loves with a friend. When that User sends her friend an Extole link to that retailer, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the website where often the Client will provide a reward because of User recommendation applicable at purchase. When the friend purchases, the Client will often give the User a reward as well. The Client would gain insights and analytics as to how their site and rewards appeal to Users and friends.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with the law. Extole is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy and terms and conditions. Users should review the privacy policy and terms and conditions of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Opt-Outs
Extole supports functionality to allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data privacy rights. Clients can flag in the Extole SDK that a particular User has requested that their data not be processed by Extole, in which case Extole will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website

Extole collects information from Website visitors (“you” or “Website Users”) located at www.extole.com (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at my.extole.com. The types of information we may collect and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with us and the requirements of applicable law. Below are the legal bases and some of the ways we collect information and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

If you no longer have access to the Client Portals, you may submit a request to remove Personal Information you provided to us by emailing a request to privacy@impact.com or contacting us by telephone or mail as further specified in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before removing your information.
We reserve the right to retain and use Client Personal Information as reasonably necessary to comply with our contractual obligations to you, and in order to comply with applicable laws, including privacy and/or data protection legislation.

If you are a customer of one of our Clients, or a visitor to their website (or have downloaded one of our Client’s applications), please contact the Client to request access to your Personal Information, or to correct or have such information deleted. If you do contact Impact, Impact does not associate the data that we process on behalf of our Clients with any particular individual, and Impact may not be able to verify whether we have Personal Information that belongs to you. See information below at How to Contact Us if you have questions regarding this policy or requests regarding your Personal Information.
Other Information
Log Data
Impact collects information that your browser or device sends whenever you visit our Website or use our Services, and we collect browser and device data as part of our Services for our Clients (“Log Data”). When we collect this of our Clients, this Log Data may include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Website or Services that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, your activity on those pages and other statistics. In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Services’ functionality. These third-party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information. When you access the Services by or through a mobile device, we may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, your location information and other statistics. Please see the section regarding Location Information below regarding the use of your location information and your options.
The Log Data that we collect for our Clients, of visitors to their website or mobile applications, includes the visitor’s computer or mobile device IP address, browser type, browser version, and the ads that you interact with. If you are referred by one of our Clients to another’s website or application from interactions with the ads, we are passed information if you conclude an action there, such as the purchase of goods or services, signing-up for a newsletter or downloading an application. Impact does not receive your name, address, credit card, or other personally identifying information.
Location Information
In addition to Log Data, Impact may use and store information about Clients and Clients’ visitors’ location depending on the permissions that have been set on the relevant device. We use this information about our Clients to provide features of our Services and to improve and customize our Services. For our Clients’ visitors, Impact collects location information to attribute actions to particular Clients and for fraud prevention. You can enable or disable location services through your device settings.
Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and transferred to your device. For visitors to our Website and our Clients’ visitors, we use cookies to collect information in order to perform and improve our Website and Services. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. The “Help” feature on most browsers provide information on how to accept cookies, disable cookies or to notify you when receiving a new cookie. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our Website or Services (or our Clients’ websites) and we recommend that you leave them turned on.
Integrations
For Clients, you may enhance the Services by enabling Impact integrations with third-party products. If you provide third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Further, Impact software may request permissions to take actions on your behalf using your third-party account credentials.
Service Providers
We may employ third-party companies and individuals (our “agents”) to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Service-related services and/or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. Examples may include processing and storing data, delivering messages, processing credit card payments, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, and providing customer service. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are under written obligation not to disclose or use your Personal Information for any purpose other than those disclosed in this Privacy Policy. We do not transfer data to non-agent third parties, except as indicated above in “Personal Information Collection and Use”.
Notwithstanding any legal and contractual obligations between us and our agents, we remain potentially liable for any misuse of your Personal Information.
Your Options for Communications
For Clients and our Website visitors that sign-up to be contacted, Impact may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.
Security of Personal Information
The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.
International Transfer of Personal Information
Your Personal Information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction, and in some cases be less stringent as compared to those of your own region. Our servers are located in data centers within the United States and other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Impact utilizes the EEA’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the purposes of transfers from the EEA to Impact and its Affiliates located outside of the EEA. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. Our Affiliates process Personal Information if necessary and appropriate for the business purposes (or legal basis) for which it was collected, and this may include if you have contacted the Affiliate directly for assistance or provide them directly with your information. Your consent to this Privacy Policy and your submission of Personal Information represents your agreement to those transfers.
Links to Other Sites
Our website and Services may contain links to other web sites or online locations that are not operated or controlled by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every online site or location you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Children’s Privacy
Only persons who are age 18 or older have permission to access our Services. Our Services are not for access by anyone under the age of 18 (“Children”). We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from Children. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your Child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a Child without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
If the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applies to your Personal Information, we confirm that we are a Service Provider for our Clients and that we do not sell your Personal Information (which under the CCPA includes information about your household). We only share such Personal Information as described in this policy. Impact processes your Personal Information for the purposes described in this policy, which include the following “business purposes” under the CCPA:
Security. Impact uses and may disclose information to detect, prevent and respond to security incidents, and for protecting against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity. For example, to protect our Services, Impact may receive or disclose information about IP addresses that malicious actors have compromised.
Analytics & Services. Impact uses information for analytics to understand how our Services are used, as well as in the performance of our Services. We disclose data to our Clients pursuant to our agreements with them and their instructions, and this includes Personal Data of visitors to their websites and applications. If instructed by a Client to delete Personal Data, we delete the data or anonymized it (including automatically after a set period of time).
Maintenance of our Services. Impact uses Personal Information of our Clients to ensure that our Services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting bugs and other issues that we observe or that are reported to us.
Research and Development. Impact uses Personal Information of our Clients concerning their use of our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our Clients. We do not use Personal Information of our Clients’ visitors for these purposes.
Use of Service Providers. Personal Information is processed by our Affiliates and third-party Service Providers to perform services on our behalf, in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we utilize cloud storage solutions to store data that we process.
Compliance. Impact also uses information to satisfy applicable laws or regulations, and discloses information in response to legal process or enforceable government requests, including to law enforcement.
If the CCPA is applicable to you and you have additional questions or requests related to your rights under the CCPA, see How to Contact Us below.
Retention and Deletion
Impact retains Personal Data only as long as is reasonably necessary for the performance of its Services, and Personal Data of our Clients’ visitors is automatically deleted or anonymized after ninety days. When Impact is requested to delete Personal Data prior to such automatic deletion, we follow a process to make sure that genuine requests are honored. This involves verifying that the requestor is the individual that is the data subject, or, if the request comes from a Client about its visitors, we delete Personal Data as instructed by our Client. Since we do not collect personally identifiable information of our Client’s visitors, if the information comes directly from a Client’s visitor we may not be able to verify that we have any such data, or to match a request with a particular Client.
When deleting data, the Personal Data is completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. If we have collected Personal Data about you from more than one Client, we will delete all instances of the Personal Data that we have at the time of the request (to the extent that we are able to verify and match such data). However, if you subsequently authorize or visit the same Client or another Client’s website or application, we will have processed your Personal Data in relation to such authorization or visit.
Privacy Policy Changes
We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of our website and/or the Services after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us, or by placing a prominent notice on our website.

Frequently asked questions
Data privacy management software helps businesses automate and enforce certain controls or settings to protect sensitive data and stay compliant with privacy laws and regulations.
These tools can help keep an updated inventory of data to know which information is stored where, who has access, and any transformations the data has undergone. It can also help regulate internal access to sensitive or high-risk data (like personally identifiable information) and encrypt data for further protection.
The needs and requirements of a privacy management tool will depend on your business, but a few common things to look for include:
Data encryption abilities
Permission and user controls to prevent unauthorized access
Integration capabilities
User rights management (e.g., handle requests for data deletion)
Managing data privacy requires a clear set of policies and procedures. It begins with documenting what data your business collects, why you’re collecting it, who has access to it, and where it ultimately will be stored. From there, businesses can begin to classify data based on risk level, manage who has access internally, and enforce different security measures like encryption at rest and in transit.
Managing data privacy also requires having a clear understanding of overarching data privacy laws and regulations that apply to your business. Many businesses also appoint a
Data Protection Officer
to help oversee these efforts.
Data privacy tools are especially helpful for managing data privacy at scale, as they’re able to automate auditing, risk detection, and more.
Segment’s Privacy Portal automates data governance at scale so businesses can protect customer data and stay compliant with laws and regulations like the GDPR and CCPA. A few key features to Segment’s Privacy Portal include:
The ability to automatically detect and classify sensitive or high-risk data (e.g., PII)
Proactively block data that doesn’t adhere to your company’s tracking plan
PManage user deletion or suppression requests at scale
Data encryption at rest and in transit
An
open-source consent manager
And more!
