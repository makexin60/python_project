Permissions We Use
Accessibility Service (Necessary)
When you are using our auto clicker app, we will request this permission to help implement our app's core features, such as simulating auto clicks. We do not collect your private data through this permission.
Ignore Battery Optimization (Optional)
Turning on this permission ensures that the app will not be automatically closed by the system when the device battery is low. This allows the app to run safely in the background and provide a consistently stable service for users. This permission is optional, and without it, the quality of your experience may be affected.
QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES
Lists All Installed Apps
:This permission allows the app to access a complete list of installed apps, which is needed to show all available apps for selection in the auto-start feature.
Auto-Start Mode Activation :
When a user selects an app, this feature ensures that the selected mode (auto-click, gestures, etc.) starts automatically whenever the
app is opened.
Required for Android 11+ Restrictions
: Since Android 11 and above restrict access to installed app lists, QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES is necessary to make the auto-start
feature work properly.
FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL USE
Requires special permission for foreground services that interact with user inputs (like accessibility services, auto-clickers, and floating views).
Floating Click Service runs a persistent floating overlay (UI) and performs auto-click actions, it needs this permission to function without restrictions
.
Security
We value your trust in providing us with the permissions necessary to protect your device. We are committed to ensuring that the App operates securely and that your privacy is maintained. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
User Consent
By granting the requested permissions, you enable the app to function as intended. If you choose not to allow certain permissions, some features may not work, and we may be unable to perform specific tasks.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will be considered your acceptance of those changes.
