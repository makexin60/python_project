Notice to Parents:
The games available through the App are directed at Children, who may be subject to special legal protections under applicable law. Ensuring the safety of Children using the App, in particular when it comes to the Personal Data we collect, is of paramount important to us.

We do not collect the names or other information that would allow us to identify any individual Child, however, we do collect device IDs and information related to gameplay. Where only one Child uses the App on a specific device, this would be considered Personal Data.
By permitting a Child to use our App, you represent that you are such Child's legal guardian, that you consent to our use of Personal Data as described herein, and you agree that you will be responsible for the Child's use of the App, including monitoring and supervising the Child and ensuring compliance with these Terms. You should read this Privacy Notice and explain to any Children using the App the implications of this Privacy Notice.
If you or the applicable Child is an individual located in the European Union ("
EU Individual
"), some additional terms and rights may apply, as detailed herein. Kido Games is the data controller in respect of the processing activities outlined in this Privacy Notice. Our registered office is Derech Begin 132, Tel Avi, Israel and our company number is 516530359.
