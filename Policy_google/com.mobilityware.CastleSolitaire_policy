PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: September 18, 2024
APPLE ARCADE
This section applies if you are playing a MobilityWare app that is part of Apple Arcade.
Data. MobilityWare does not collect, access, or store any of your data as part of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games.
iCloud. Our Apple Arcade games provide full support for Apple’s iCloud service. This means they automatically save some of your game information (such as progress, daily challenges, and current game state) in a special way that allows the iCloud service to access it. If you have iCloud enabled on your device, the iCloud service will send that data into the cloud, on your behalf. It will also pull that data back down so that you can continue your experience on any of your devices. This process never involves MobilityWare servers or storage, in any way. You can enable/disable iCloud through your device settings.
Customer Support. We want you to have the best experience possible. If you choose to contact customer support from within our Apple Arcade games, we will populate an email with information that will help us solve your problem. This email will show all the information we are sending, in human-readable text. You will have full control over what, when, and how the information is sent. As this email is outside of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games, any data sent to MobilityWare is covered by all of the terms of the MobilityWare Privacy Policy.
Anonymized Data. As part of the Apple Arcade service, MobilityWare may periodically receive data from Apple about the general usage of our games. This data is anonymized, which means it cannot be connected to individuals in any way.
Children. Apple allows children to play Apple Arcade games. Fortunately, MobilityWare does not collect, access, or store any of your data as part of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games. As a guardian, you can provide additional protection by restricting access to iCloud, email, or websites on your devices. Please note that our customer support team and the MobilityWare websites are outside the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games – they should never be accessed by children or minors. Please see the “Use By Minors” section for more information.

Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Calling us at (866) 233-8624
Emailing us at
privacy@mobilityware.com
Going directly in the Settings of the application you are using
Only you, or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf (“Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through the mobile application sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific application.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights below.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
We will deliver our written response to you electronically.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time (the “Right to Opt-Out”). We do not sell the Personal Information of Users we actually know are less than 18 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “Right to Opt-In”) from the parent or guardian of a consumer who is between 13 and 18 years of age. If you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to access the site, use any of our Services, or play any of our games.
Users who opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
California law requires that we maintain a separate link that allows you to opt out of the sale of your information. To exercise the Right to Opt-Out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us:
privacy@mobilityware.com

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.

Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

APPLE ARCADE
This section applies if you are playing a MobilityWare app that is part of Apple Arcade.
Data. MobilityWare does not collect, access, or store any of your data as part of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games.
iCloud. Our Apple Arcade games provide full support for Apple’s iCloud service. This means they automatically save some of your game information (such as progress, daily challenges, and current game state) in a special way that allows the iCloud service to access it. If you have iCloud enabled on your device, the iCloud service will send that data into the cloud, on your behalf. It will also pull that data back down so that you can continue your experience on any of your devices. This process never involves MobilityWare servers or storage, in any way. You can enable/disable iCloud through your device settings.
Customer Support. We want you to have the best experience possible. If you choose to contact customer support from within our Apple Arcade games, we will populate an email with information that will help us solve your problem. This email will show all the information we are sending, in human-readable text. You will have full control over what, when, and how the information is sent. As this email is outside of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games, any data sent to MobilityWare is covered by all of the terms of the MobilityWare Privacy Policy.
Anonymized Data. As part of the Apple Arcade service, MobilityWare may periodically receive data from Apple about the general usage of our games. This data is anonymized, which means it cannot be connected to individuals in any way.
Children. Apple allows children to play Apple Arcade games. Fortunately, MobilityWare does not collect, access, or store any of your data as part of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games. As a guardian, you can provide additional protection by restricting access to iCloud, email, or websites on your devices. Please note that our customer support team and the MobilityWare websites are outside the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games – they should never be accessed by children or minors. Please see the “Use By Minors” section for more information.

PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: September 18, 2024
APPLE ARCADE
This section applies if you are playing a MobilityWare app that is part of Apple Arcade.
Data. MobilityWare does not collect, access, or store any of your data as part of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games.
iCloud. Our Apple Arcade games provide full support for Apple’s iCloud service. This means they automatically save some of your game information (such as progress, daily challenges, and current game state) in a special way that allows the iCloud service to access it. If you have iCloud enabled on your device, the iCloud service will send that data into the cloud, on your behalf. It will also pull that data back down so that you can continue your experience on any of your devices. This process never involves MobilityWare servers or storage, in any way. You can enable/disable iCloud through your device settings.
Customer Support. We want you to have the best experience possible. If you choose to contact customer support from within our Apple Arcade games, we will populate an email with information that will help us solve your problem. This email will show all the information we are sending, in human-readable text. You will have full control over what, when, and how the information is sent. As this email is outside of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games, any data sent to MobilityWare is covered by all of the terms of the MobilityWare Privacy Policy.
Anonymized Data. As part of the Apple Arcade service, MobilityWare may periodically receive data from Apple about the general usage of our games. This data is anonymized, which means it cannot be connected to individuals in any way.
Children. Apple allows children to play Apple Arcade games. Fortunately, MobilityWare does not collect, access, or store any of your data as part of the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games. As a guardian, you can provide additional protection by restricting access to iCloud, email, or websites on your devices. Please note that our customer support team and the MobilityWare websites are outside the normal operation of our Apple Arcade games – they should never be accessed by children or minors. Please see the “Use By Minors” section for more information.

You have the right to request that MobilityWare delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Calling us at (866) 233-8624
Emailing us at
privacy@mobilityware.com
Going directly in the Settings of the application you are using
Only you, or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf (“Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through the mobile application sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific application.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights below.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
We will deliver our written response to you electronically.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time (the “Right to Opt-Out”). We do not sell the Personal Information of Users we actually know are less than 18 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “Right to Opt-In”) from the parent or guardian of a consumer who is between 13 and 18 years of age. If you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to access the site, use any of our Services, or play any of our games.
Users who opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
California law requires that we maintain a separate link that allows you to opt out of the sale of your information. To exercise the Right to Opt-Out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us:
privacy@mobilityware.com
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
