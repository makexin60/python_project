To the extent data is transmitted out of the Services, Company is not responsible for the privacy, security or integrity of that data.

THE SERVICES, BETA FEATURES, AND ADVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
INDEMNIFICATION
Customer Indemnity.
Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold Company, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, successors in interest, employees, and agents harmless from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, settlements, and expenses (including, but not limited to attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “Claims”) by a third party related to, arising from, or connected with: (a) Customer’s or any User’s use of the Services; (b) Customer’s or any User’s breach of the AUP or any representation or warranty made by Customer herein or therein; (c) Custom Works and/or any Customer Content (including, without limitation, Claims alleging that the Custom Works and/or the Customer Content violates or misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights or other rights of any third party); (d) Customer’s or User’s gross negligence or intentional misconduct; (e) an allegation of defamation or invasion of privacy by Customer or any User; and/or (f) any violation of Law by Customer or any User. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall not make any admissions on behalf of Company or settle any Claim without Company’s consent.
Company’s Right to Defend.
Promptly upon learning of any Claim against Customer arising from or related to allegations that the Services violate or infringe a third party’s privacy or Intellectual Property Rights (a
“Services Claim”
), Customer shall give notice to Company of the Services Claim and immediately deliver to Company all original notices and documents (including court papers) received in connection with and/or related to the Services Claim. Company will have the exclusive right, but no obligation, to assume defense of such Services Claim at any time and at any stage. If Company assumes defense of any such Services Claim, Customer shall cooperate in the defense thereof as reasonably requested by Company. Upon assuming the defense of a Services Claim, Company may appoint any legal counsel selected by Company and settle any Services Claims on such terms and conditions that Company deems advisable. Customer agrees that upon Company’s assumption of the defense of the Services Claim: (a) Company will not be liable to Customer for any legal costs or expenses subsequently incurred by Customer in connection with the Services Claim; (b) such assumption is not an acknowledgment by Company that it is liable to indemnify Customer in respect of the Services Claim; and (c) it will not constitute a waiver by Company of any defenses it may assert against the Customer if Customer claims it is owed indemnification for such Services Claim. If, in Company’s sole opinion, any Claim related to, arising from, or connected with allegations that the Services infringe, violate or misappropriate a third party's Intellectual Property Rights may have validity, then Company may modify the Services, or any part thereof, to make them non-infringing, non-violating or non-misappropriating, as applicable, procure any necessary license, or replace the affected item with one that is substantially functionally equivalent in all material respects. If Company determines in its sole opinion that none of these alternatives are reasonably available, then Company may terminate this Agreement, Customer will discontinue all use of the allegedly infringing Services, and Company will issue Customer a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees for such Services based on the number of months remaining in the then-current Order Term.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY BE LIABLE TO THE CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IN THE EVENT THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES IS FOUND LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, IN NO EVENT COMPANY’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDERING DOCUMENT IN THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT EXPAND THIS LIMITATION. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. CUSTOMER AGREES THAT COMPANY’S LIABILITY WILL BE REDUCED BY THE EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH CUSTOMER CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOSS.
CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE AMOUNT OF FEES CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH MAKING THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMER, AND THAT, IF COMPANY WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN, SUCH FEES WOULD OF NECESSITY BE SET SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER.

Nothing in this Agreement purports to modify or exclude the conditions, warranties and undertakings, and other legal rights that Customer may have available under the Australian Consumer Law.

As an email service provider, Campaign Monitor takes an active role in reducing spam and supporting regulatory and best-practice guidance that fosters a fair, respectful and effective email marketing community. In consideration of the many anti-spam laws in effect throughout the world and best practice guidance from industry leaders, we have created this anti-spam policy to simplify the requirements we place on our customers. Your adherence to this policy will help maintain a high reputation for our sending infrastructure which, in turn, will boost the deliverability and effectiveness of messages you send using our services.
Throughout this Anti-Spam Policy references to “Company” are references to Campaign Monitor and references to “Customer” are to you, a user of the Services.
SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS.
In addition to terms defined elsewhere in this Anti-Spam Policy, the definitions below will apply to capitalized words in this Anti-Spam Policy. Capitalized words in this Anti-Spam Policy that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed in the Agreement or Acceptable Use Policy (as applicable).

SECTION 2. REQUIRED CONTENT
A.
Customer understands and agrees that Customer is the “sender” (as that term is defined by Anti-Spam Laws) of any emails sent by Customer via the Services.
B.
Unsubscribe Link.
Unless expressly agreed by Company in advance in writing, Customer must ensure that all emails sent through Customer’s Account contain a Company (or other Company-approved) “unsubscribe” link, in form and substance satisfactory to Company, that: 1) allows Contacts to instantly and permanently unsubscribe themselves from the applicable Customer List, 2) presents unsubscribe instructions in a clear and conspicuous way, and 3) remains operational for a period of 30 days after sending the email. Customer must monitor, correct, and process unsubscribe requests immediately and ensure that Users do not remove, disable or attempt to remove or disable such link. Customer understands that instead of using the unsubscribe link provided, some Contacts may use other means to submit a request to Customer to opt them out of receiving such messages. In such cases, Customer agrees to unsubscribe any such Contact manually, by changing the Contact's mailing status to "opt-out" within 10 business days of the opt-out request using the tools provided inside Customer’s Account.
C.
Contact Information
. Each email must clearly and accurately identify the individual or organization that authorized the sending of the email (“Authorizing Party”). This means that if Customer is sending messages on behalf of an Authorizing Party, the Authorizing Party must be identified. For example, if a marketing agency is sending an email on behalf of its client, the client must be identified. To the extent required by law, identification must include the correct legal name of the Authorizing Party, a registered business number, legitimate physical address, and contact details. All identification information should remain valid for at least 30 days after the email is sent.
D.
Other Required Information.
Customer shall ensure that communications sent through Customer’s Account are truthful and include subject lines that are in no way false or misleading as to the nature of the content contained in the email. All emails must state the reason the Contact is receiving the message. For example, “You are receiving this message from ABC Company because you signed up for our email list at abc.com.”
SECTION 3. PERMISSION
A.
Customer Representations.
Customer represents and warrants that Customer has provided all disclosures required by Law in conjunction with obtaining Contact’s Permission. Customer further represents and warrants that Customer
has not used any false or misleading information, names, email addresses, subject lines, or other information for the purpose of or in connection with obtaining Contact’s Permission.
B.
Obtaining Permission
. Customer must retain records of any Permissions received and shall provide such records to Company immediately upon request. Permissions must be obtained in one of the ways described below. A Contact:
i.  fills out or opts in via a web form subscribing to receive marketing communications from Customer; provided that the form does not contain any pre-selected fields;
ii.  completes an offline form that expressly indicates their willingness to receive marketing communications from Customer;
iii.  gives Customer their business card; provided that Contact was informed that by providing the business card to Customer, Contact was indicating their willingness to receive marketing communications from Customer;
iv.  has a clear relationship with Customer, as an individual that (a) pays dues or a subscription fee to belong to Customer’s organization, or (b) has purchased a good or service from Customer within the preceding 6 months, in the course of which Customer obtained that Contact’s email address and there is a reasonable expectation that the Contact would consent to receiving emails; or
v.  otherwise provides Customer with their express written permission to receive marketing communications from Customer.
C.
Scope of Permission.
Customer shall not send emails to Contacts on any topic that exceeds the scope of the topic that Contact has given Customer Permission to email them about. Where a Contact has provided Permission for specific individual or organization to contact them, that Permission may not be transferred to another individual or organization. Any Permission obtained from a Contact will be exclusive to Customer and will not extend to Customer’s Affiliates, unless such Permission was also granted to such Customer Affiliate.
SECTION 4. APPROVALS, RESTRICTIONS, & COMPLIANCE
A. Account
Approval.
Company may request specific information about Customer’s Permission practices and email marketing activities prior to allowing access to the Services and Company’s sending infrastructure. Should Company’s trained compliance team, in its reasonable discretion, find cause to delay or withhold access, to the Services and Company’s sending infrastructure, Customer will be notified promptly. Customer may not send any emails using the Services until Customer’s Account has been reviewed by a member of Company’s trained compliance team.
B. Bulk
Uploads.
Prior to any bulk and/or large Contact list uploads to the Services, Customer must obtain Company’s prior written approval, which may be withheld in
Company’s
sole discretion.
C. Company
API.
The Services provide API Calls (“Calls”) to facilitate certain account activities without relying on the Services’ main application interface. These Calls are governed by the same policies set forth herein. The Customer and its Users shall not use the API to circumvent Company's efforts to facilitate Permission-based sending via the Services. Company may dictate, in its sole discretion, permissible use of the API and Calls. Any improper use of the API, as solely determined by Company, will be grounds for immediate termination of Customer's account.
D. Prohibited
Uses.
There are some list collection methods, sending practices, and models of business which are irreconcilably at odds with Company’s Permission policy or which represent untenable risk to the reputation of Company’s sending infrastructure. Customer shall not:
i.  mail to Distribution Email Addresses, emails addresses copied or scraped from the internet (
or to Contact email addresses otherwise programmatically obtained from any physical or electronic source)
; newsgroups, or purchased, loaned, or rented lists;
ii.  mail to any Contacts obtained from a third party (unless such third party specifically obtained Permission from the Contact for Customer to mail them);
iii.  mail to
co-promotion lists, where more than one potential sender is given access to email addresses collected without the recipient’s willful, sender-specific consent;
iv.  use the Transactional Email Feature to send non-Transactional Messages to Contacts unless you have Permission to do so;
v.  use the Services to administer illegal contests, pyramid schemes, chain letters, multi-level marketing campaigns, or otherwise conduct any illegal activities; or
vi.  take known demographic information and append it to information Customer obtains from a third party for the purpose of emailing an individual who has not otherwise provided Permission as required by this Anti-Spam Policy.
E.
Compliance.
Customer acknowledges that the Services allow Customer to upload data related to Contacts and also to track Contacts engagement with emails sent using the Services. Customer represents and warrants that Customer has complied with all notice, disclosure, consent, and other requirements imposed by applicable Laws prior to uploading information about a Contact to
Customer’s A
ccount. Customer further represent and warrants that Customer shall comply with the Acceptable Use Policy, Agreement, and all applicable Laws in connection with Customer’s use of the Services
.
SECTION 5. COMPANY’S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
A. Contacts.
Company will not use Contacts’ information for any purpose other than those related to the Services and as otherwise described in
Company’s
Privacy Notice.
B. Monitoring.
Company reserves the right to inspect and monitor Customer’s Account and Customer Content at any time, without notice, to ensure compliance with the terms of this Anti-Spam Policy.  In connection with the foregoing, Customer agrees to promptly provide records and/or other information requested by Company. In addition, Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to:
i.  scan every campaign for the existence of an unsubscribe link. If an unsubscribe link is not detected, Customer will be informed and required to include Company’s unsubscribe link before sending additional email messages or Customer Content via the Services.
ii.  monitor and meter the number of kilobytes of data transferred when sending email messages.
iii.  monitor any and all Customer Content and Customer’s use of the Services to ensure compliance with this Anti-Spam Policy.
C.
Abuse
Complaints & Remediation.
Emails sent through the Services may generate abuse complaints from Contacts. Customer is responsible for ensuring that email campaigns sent from Customer’s Accounts do not generate a number of complaints in excess of industry norms. If Customer’s complaint rate exceeds industry norms, Company may take action to prevent or repair damage to the sending reputation of its sending infrastructure, including suspending Customer’s Account. In the event that Company sends Customer a notification regarding excessive spam complaints, Customer must respond to Company’s requests promptly and act in good faith by participating in the creation and/or execution of any remedy. If Customer is unresponsive, does not implement remediation measures in accordance with Company’s recommendations within thirty (30) days of Company’s notification to Customer, and/or Customer continues to experience high complaint rates (as determined by Company in its reasonable discretion), then Company may suspend Customer’s use of the Services until the issue is resolved or until the end of the period specified by the contract.
D. Right
to Terminate.
Company may, in its reasonable discretion, remove any Customer Content, suspend, or terminate (without refund)
Customer’s use of the Services for any actual breach of this Anti-Spam Policy at any time. For clarity, removal, suspension, or termination pursuant to this clause will not terminate Customer’s obligation to pay fees owed to Company.
If you feel you have received SPAM from our customer, write to us at
abuse@campaignmonitor.com
. If we find that our anti-SPAM policy has been violated, we may terminate the violator’s account.

Because both identifying and non-identifying information can put a researcher at risk, we limit what we share with third parties, as further described below.
If your security research as part of the bug bounty program violates certain restrictions in our site policies, the safe harbor terms permit a limited exemption.
1. Safe Harbor Terms
We consider vulnerability research conducted according to this policy to be:
Exempt as authorized under any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good-faith violations of this policy;
Exempt as authorized under any relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service (TOS) and/or Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis; Except:
Where the use of services puts an excessive burden on the bandwidth of our services or compromises their performance;
Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the internet, and conducted in good faith.
You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
2. Third Party Safe Harbor
If you submit a report through our bug bounty program which affects a third party service, we will limit what we share with any affected third party. We may share non-identifying content from your report with an affected third party, but only after notifying you that we intend to do so and getting the third party's written commitment that they will not pursue legal action against you or initiate contact with law enforcement based on your report.
Please note that we cannot authorize out-of-scope testing in the name of third parties, and such testing is beyond the scope of our policy. Refer to that third party's bug bounty policy, if they have one, or contact the third party either directly or through a legal representative before initiating any testing on that third party’s systems or services. This is not, and should not be understood as, any agreement on our part to defend, indemnify, or otherwise protect you from any third party claim based on your actions.
That said, if legal action is initiated by a third party, including law enforcement, against you because of your participation in this bug bounty program, and you have complied with this Safe Harbor Policy and have not acted in bad faith, upon your written request, we will inform the third party that your actions were conducted in compliance with this Safe Harbor Policy.
3. Limited Waiver of Other Site Policies
If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this Safe Harbor Policy, please submit a report in advance as set forth in the security text file located
here
.
Note that the Safe Harbor applies only to legal claims under our control; it does not bind independent third parties.

“Profiling” is defined as “the collection and use of personal information to assess certain characteristics of a natural person, in particular for the purpose of analysing that person’s work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests or behaviour”.
We do monitor web page interactions and track your location when using the Website, if and when you choose to activate such technologies by accepting cookies on the website. For further information, please consult our Cookies Policy available on our website.
Consent to Collection of Personal Data
Generally speaking, we will obtain your consent prior to any collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data, except where such collection, use or disclosure is authorized or required by applicable law. You are generally not obliged to provide your Personal Data, however, please note that, in certain cases, we may be unable to provide certain Services to you or enable access to the Website if you refuse ‎to provide certain Personal ‎Data.‎ ‎
You have the right to change your mind and withdraw consent to future ‎processing of Personal Data by writing to us at
privacy@helpshift.com
. Please note that ‎such withdrawal may impact our continued ability to provide certain Services or access to the Website to you. Such ‎withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any processing which took place prior to such ‎withdrawal, nor does it ‎create an obligation for us to delete Personal Data which we are ‎otherwise ‎allowed or ‎required to retain under applicable law.‎
Further Processing
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collect it (as outlined above), unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose, it is clearly to the benefit of the person concerned or is otherwise authorized or required by applicable law. If we need to use your Personal Data for any other reasonable purposes in connection with our engagement with you, the purpose for any further processing will be made known to you in advance. We may ask you to provide additional consent to such processing, if and to the extent required by applicable law.
If you provide your social network account credentials to us or otherwise sign-in to the Services through a third-party site or service, some content and/or information in those accounts may be transmitted into your account with us. This will be specifically addressed in the relevant app privacy notice or software-specific privacy notice to which you are required to give consent before installing same.
Sharing Your Personal Data with Other Entities
We will share Personal Data with our service providers or any other entities acting as Keywords’ agents or data processors for the purposes of providing services to Keywords and on the understanding that Personal Data will only be processed in line with our instructions and in compliance with all applicable legal obligations.  Generally, we may share Personal Data where this is authorized or required by law (including by a court or administrative body having order-making or relevant regulatory power).
All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to another entity if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction (or proposed transaction) in which that other entity assumes control of our business (in whole or in part), to the extent necessary to give effect to such transaction. In such instances we will take steps to ensure that the third party has agreed in writing to protect your Personal Data, and that you are notified in writing of the transfer where possible.
Data Transfer
Generally, transfers of Personal Data outside Québec will not occur unless and until a data privacy assessment has been undertaken by us and appropriate safeguards have been put in place to protect the Personal Data.
Data Retention
We retain Personal Data about you for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise authorized or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. In general, Keywords (or its service providers on its behalf) will hold this information for a period of seven years after you cease to interact with us, unless it is obliged to hold it for a longer period under applicable law or regulatory requirements. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally, whether directly or indirectly.
Your Rights
You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below.
You have the right to request a copy of your Personal Data from Keywords.
If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request correction of any inaccuracies and, in certain circumstances, to request erasure of the Personal Data.
You may request, in certain circumstances, that we ‎cease disseminating your Personal Data or to ‎‎de-‎index any hyperlink that allows access to ‎that Personal Data by technological means, ‎‎if ‎such dissemination contravenes applicable ‎law or a court.‎
Any such access/correction/erasure requests can be made to Keywords’ Québec Data Protection Officer at
privacy@helpshift.com

For security purposes, authorized agents will be required to provide proof of their authorization in their first communication with us, and we may also require that the relevant consumer directly verify their identity and the authority of the authorized agent.
Unless otherwise permitted by the CCPA, you may only make a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. Therefore, we will need your first and last name, email address, and, if applicable, customer number. In some cases, we may request additional information to verify your identity, or where necessary to process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity after a good faith attempt, we may deny the request and, if so, will explain the basis for the denial.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or
Enable Opt-in Reporting (Android)
Performance Monitoring

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).
