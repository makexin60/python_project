        (information or software) on Skiplagged's web site or apps for personal,
        non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license,

                non-commercial);
attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Skiplagged's web site or apps;

        license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed
        format.
3. Disclaimer
The materials on Skiplagged's web site and apps are provided "as is". Skiplagged makes no warranties, expressed or
        implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied
        warranties
        or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
        property
        or other violation of rights. Further, Skiplagged does not warrant or make any representations concerning
        the

        relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site or app.

    for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the
    materials on Skiplagged's Internet site or apps, even if Skiplagged or a Skiplagged authorized representative has
    been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow
    limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
    limitations may not apply to you.

    therefore makes no guarantees of entry with purchases made on its web site or apps.
8. Fees
If you are making a purchase from outside your local country, your bank may convert your payment amount to your 
    local currency and charge you a conversion fee. Rates are determined by your bank, not Skiplagged. In such cases, 
    the amount shown on your billing statement may be different from the amount shown on Skiplagged’s web site or apps 
    at the time of purchase. They may also charge you a foreign transaction fee depending on the type of card you use 
    and how they choose to classify the transaction. With some cards, booking an international trip is considered an 
    international purchase. We urge users to check with their banks prior to making an international purchase.
 
    For purchases made on Skiplagged’s web site, there may be a fee charged. The full amount of this fee will be disclosed 
    to user prior to making their payment.

    including ad networks, may use cross-device/cross-context tracking. For example, you might use multiple browsers on a single device,

    across these various contexts and devices. Cross-device/cross-context technology may be used to connect these various accounts or 
    profiles and the corresponding data from the different contexts and devices.

9. THIRD PARTY SITES
The Skiplagged Services may provide links to other websites or resources over which Skiplagged does not have control (“External Web Sites”). 
    Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Skiplagged of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that Skiplagged is providing these 
    links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Skiplagged is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your 
    use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the applicable External Web Site. We encourage you 
    to be aware when leaving our Services and to read the privacy statements of External Web Sites that collect your personal information.
10. SECURITY
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we employ 
    procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to help safeguard the information we collect. Only authorized Skiplagged 
    personnel have access to the personal information, including server logs and cookie utilization data, that we collect. These individuals are 
    required to follow strict security policies and procedures. Skiplagged may use encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection 
    and other physical and logical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to such. Skiplagged may also place internal restrictions 
    on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to such information.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, despite our efforts, 
    we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We do not warrant or represent that personal information about you will be protected against, loss, 
    misuse, or alteration by third parties.
If you use the Services, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and password. You are responsible for 
    restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password. We cannot secure 
    any personal information that you release on your own, that you request us to release or that is released through another third party to whom you've given access.
Where required under applicable law or by contract, we will notify the appropriate parties or individuals of any loss, misuse or alteration of 
    personal information so that such parties or individuals can take the appropriate actions for the due protection of their rights. If such personal information is 
    information of a Skiplagged customer, we will notify such customer and coordinate with them regarding any required notices to particular individuals.
11. CHILDREN
We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy and safety of children. The Skiplagged Services are not intended for children under 13 years of 
    age - and for European residents, for children under 16 years of age - see our
European Privacy Policy
. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Anyone under 13 should not use the Skiplagged Services. If we learn we have 
     collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might 
     have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us as set forth below.
12. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
The Skiplagged Services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world, including the United States and other countries. 
    Therefore, personal information about individuals or customers may be transferred, processed and stored outside the country where the Skiplagged Services are used, 
    including to countries outside the European Union (“EU”), European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, where the level of data protection may not be deemed adequate 
    by the European Commission. With respect to Europe, we may use standard data protection clauses adopted by supervisory authorities and approved by the European

Personal Data and Processing.
For the purposes of this European Privacy Policy:
“Personal Data”
means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person who can be identified, 
    directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, 
    location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, 
    mental, economic, cultural or social identity of such natural person; and
"Processing"
means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data,

    or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, 
    alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
Personal Data may be transferred outside of Europe, provided that certain conditions as set out in the applicable 
    legislation are complied with. Your Personal Data will also be processed by personnel operating outside Europe who

    of support services. We are party to data transfer agreements with each of our service providers and the members of 
    our group and we will (i) keep each document up to date with current law, and (ii) only engage in personally identifiable

Arbitration and Dispute Resolution
Disputes and Arbitration
Priceline is committed to customer satisfaction.  If you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve it.  If we are unsuccessful, you may pursue your claim as explained in this section.
You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any problem, dispute, or claim relating in any way to the Priceline websites and/or any of its related applications or services (the 'Site'); any dealings with our customer service agents; the purchase, use, or performance of any services or products available through this Site; any representations made by Priceline; or our Privacy Policy (collectively, 'Claims') by providing Notice to Customer Support as described in section I.A.2.b below.  If we are unable to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, without regard to conflict of law's provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.   All Claims or other matters in dispute between you or any Third-party (as defined in paragraph K above) and Priceline, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of law's provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
Limitation on Claims
Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, any Claim must be brought within two (2) years from the date on which such Claim arose or accrued.
Mandatory Arbitration
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY.  IT REQUIRES THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, AND IT PREVENTS YOU FROM PURSUING A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING IN ANY FORUM.  THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS AGAINST PRICELINE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR COMPANIES OFFERING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE SITE.
IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY.  THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION WILL GENERALLY BE FINAL AND BINDING, WITH NO RIGHT OF APPEAL.  ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT PROCEDURES.
By using this Site, you, any Third-party (as defined in paragraph K above), and Priceline agree that any 
                Claim, including claims regarding the applicability or validity of this arbitration provision, shall be 
                resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association 
                ('AAA') and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the then applicable Rules and Procedures 
                established by AAA ('Rules and Procedures'), except that, pursuant to subsection (e) below, under no 
                circumstances may any claim be brought or arbitrated as a class action or be joined with another person's claim, 
                or proceed on a basis involving claims brought on a purported representative capacity (either on behalf of the 
                general public or other users or persons). As an exception to arbitration, you, any Third-party, and Priceline 
                retain the right to pursue in a small claims court located in the federal judicial district that includes your 
                or the Third-party's billing address at the time of the Claim, any Claim that is within the court's jurisdiction 
                and proceeds on an individual basis.  All Claims you or a Third-party bring against Priceline, its subsidiaries 
                or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site 
                must be resolved in accordance with this Disputes and Arbitration Section.  All Claims filed or brought 
                contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed and void.
If you decide to seek arbitration, you must first send, by certified mail, a written Notice of 
                Dispute ('Notice') addressed to:  Legal Department, priceline.com LLC, 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, CT 06854 
                ('Notice Address').  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (ii) set forth the specific 
                relief sought.  If Priceline and you, or Priceline and any Third-party, do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim 
                within 60 days after the Notice is received, you, or the Third-party, may commence an arbitration proceeding. 
                During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after 
                the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you, any Third-party, or Priceline is entitled. 
                A form to initiate arbitration may be downloaded
here
.
The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures 
                (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you, or any Third-party asserting a Claim), 
                or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon.
To the extent that any Claim is held not to be subject to arbitration and proceeds in a Court 
                other than small claims court, such Claim shall be filed only in the United States District Court for 
                Connecticut or, if there is no federal jurisdiction over the action, in the courts of the State of 
                Connecticut located in Fairfield County, Connecticut. You hereby consent and submit to the personal 
                jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such Claim that is not subject to the 
                arbitration provision and not pursued in small claims court, and agree that any such claim shall be 
                resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action (as described more fully in 
                section I.A.2.e below).  You further agree that any and all Claims or other matters asserted in such 
                dispute, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of 
                the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of law's provisions that would result in the 
                application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
YOU AND ANY THIRD-PARTY FURTHER AGREE THAT NO PROCEEDING AGAINST PRICELINE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR 
                AFFILIATES, OR ANY TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR COMPANIES OFFERING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH 
                THE SITE (UNDER THIS PROVISION OR OTHERWISE) MAY PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION, BE JOINED WITH ANOTHER 
                PERSON'S CLAIM, OR PROCEED ON A BASIS INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY 
                (EITHER ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR OTHER USERS OR PERSONS).  ANY AND ALL PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE 
                CLAIMS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  IN ADDITION, NO ARBITRATION PROCEEDING UNDER THIS 
                PROVISION SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED OR JOINED IN ANY WAY WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE 
                EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES.
For any arbitration involving Claims that together seek damages that do not exceed $25,000, Priceline 
                will reimburse you for all fees and costs imposed by AAA. If you are unable to pay the filing fee, 
                Priceline will pay it for you.  For any arbitration involving Claims that together seek damages 
                that exceed $25,000, if you, or any Third-party, prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against Priceline, 
                Priceline will reimburse such prevailing party for any fees or costs the prevailing party paid to AAA in 
                connection with the arbitration.
If you prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against Priceline and are awarded an amount greater than 
                Priceline's last written settlement offer to you, Priceline will pay a minimum recovery of $5,000, and 
                Priceline will reimburse you for all reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in arbitrating the Claim(s) 
                upon which you have prevailed.  If any Third-party prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against 
                Priceline and is awarded an amount greater than Priceline's last written settlement offer to such Third-party, 
                Priceline will pay a minimum recovery of $5,000 to the Third-party, and Priceline will reimburse such 
                Third-party for all reasonable attorney's fees incurred in arbitrating the Claim upon which he or 
                she has prevailed.  Any dispute regarding attorney's fees to be paid pursuant to this paragraph will be 
                decided by the arbitrator who decided the underlying Claim. If you or the Third-party do not prevail on 
                the claim or prevail but are awarded an amount less than or equal to Priceline's last written settlement 
                offer to you, Priceline will pay only the amount of the award, not the minimum recovery or attorneys' fees.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any of the Rules and Procedures established by AAA which may 
                be to the contrary, Priceline will not be entitled to seek reimbursement of its attorney's fees for any 
                Claim the arbitrator finds to be non-frivolous.
With the exception of sub-part (e) above (the class action waiver), if any part of this arbitration provision 
                is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established 
                by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance 
                with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.  
                If, however, subpart (e) above (the class action waiver) is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then 
                the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor any Third-party, nor Priceline 
                shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
Arbitration rules and forms may be obtained from AAA at
http://www.adr.org
or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
IF YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY DO NOT CHOOSE TO ACCEPT THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU OR SUCH THIRD-PARTY MUST 
                NOTIFY PRICELINE IN WRITING BY CERTIFIED MAIL WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF YOUR PURCHASE OR BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO USE 
                THE SERVICES PURCHASED ON THIS SITE, WHICHEVER DATE IS SOONER.  SUCH NOTICE SHALL BE SENT TO THE NOTICE ADDRESS 
                DEFINED IN SUBSECTION (b), ABOVE.  IF YOU SO NOTIFY US BY THAT TIME THAT YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE BINDING ARBITRATION 
                PROVISION, YOU AND ANY SUCH THIRD-PARTY MAY NOT CONTINUE TO PURCHASE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS ON THIS SITE UNLESS AND 
                UNTIL PRICELINE NOTIFIES YOU OR SUCH THIRD-PARTY OTHERWISE. PRICELINE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROHIBIT YOUR AND

You will be charged in the currency shown upon checkout in the Summary of Charges.  If you make a purchase from us using a credit or debit card in a currency that is different from the one shown to you upon checkout in the Summary of Charges, please be aware that, due to the constant fluctuation in exchange rates, our charge to your card or the estimated charge amount we provide you, may differ based on the exchange rate at the time you make your reservation versus the rate at the time the charge is reflected on your credit card statement. Also, in the event that we must credit your account, we will refund the exact amount in the currency initially charged and will not be responsible for any fluctuations in exchange rates which may cause differences in your billing statement.

B. Hotel Service Restrictions
1. General
Check In:
Upon check-in, the reservation holder must present a valid 
        ID and credit card or, in the hotel's discretion, debit card, in his or her name 
        (the amount of available credit required will vary by hotel). Debit cards may not be accepted.
Double Occupancy:
All hotel reservations are guaranteed for double occupancy 
        (i.e. 2 adults) and accommodations for more than two adults are not guaranteed. Some hotels may 
        not allow extra guests.  If your hotel does allow extra guests, there may be additional charges. 
        These charges vary and will be payable directly to the hotel.
Late Arrival and Failure to Check-in on First Night:
While you should call 
        Priceline if you wish to cancel a cancellable reservation in advance of your stay, if you are 
        going to be delayed on your date of check in or find that you cannot check in to your hotel on 
        the date you requested, you should contact the hotel to let them know. If you fail to check in 
        to your hotel on the day of your reservation and do not alert the hotel, the remaining portion 
        of your reservation may be canceled and you may not be entitled to a refund, depending on the 
        terms and conditions of the applicable hotel.
Cancellations and Changes to Your Reservation:
Hotel cancellation policies vary. 
        Certain reservations are non-cancellable and non-changeable. Others require you to pay a penalty 
        if you cancel. Still others are fully refundable. Check the hotel cancellation policy when you book. 
        If changes to your pre-paid reservation are allowed, any changes to a pre-paid reservation are only 
        permitted as a cancellation and booking of a new reservation. Disability Needs: If you have disability 
        needs (for example only, you need a wheelchair accessible room or require the use of a service animal) 
        you must call the hotel and verify that disability needs can be met. If your disability needs cannot 
        be accommodated by the hotel, please call Priceline customer service.
Hotel Accommodations and Special Requests:
Depending upon which Priceline hotel 
        reservation service you use, you may or may not be able to select your room type and number and type of 
        beds. Room assignments are based on hotel availability and are at the hotel's discretion. We cannot 
        guarantee a non-smoking room. If you have special requests (including, for example, preferences for 
        smoking or nonsmoking rooms, a specific room, particular bedding, floor location, closeness to an elevator, 
        connecting rooms, or pet accommodations), you must call the hotel and verify that special requests can be 
        met after you have made your booking. Since Priceline has no control over which room a hotel will assign 
        to you, Priceline cannot accommodate special requests in advance of your booking and cannot guarantee that 
        special requests will be met.
Must be 21 Years of Age:
The guest on the reservation must be 21 years or older to check into the hotel.
Frequent Traveler Points:
Frequent traveler points, upgrades, certificate vouchers and other discounts or 
        incentives may not apply to Priceline's hotel services.
Hotel Star Ratings (General):
Priceline's star rating system is provided for your reference. Like other 
        well-known hotel rating systems, Priceline considers a number of factors in evaluating the quality of participating 
        hotels such as: amenities, facilities, reputation, brand, other rating services, customer feedback from guests who have 
        stayed at the hotel, etc., to assign a single star rating. Priceline screens participating hotels carefully and updates 
        our information periodically to ensure the validity of our ratings. Our ratings systems may sometimes differ from those 
        of other rating systems that you may be familiar with. We do not warrant or guarantee that our star rating system is equal 
        to or consistent with any other star rating system and reserve the right to change a hotel's rating at any time with or without 
        notice.
Accommodation Types:
Priceline offers its customers various properties, including hotels, motels, 
        bed and breakfasts, resorts and other types of rentable accommodations.
2. Prices
Sometimes cheaper rates are available for a specific stay at a hotel; however, these rates made by hotels may 
    carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund. Please check the 
    room and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
Pricing Errors:
We endeavor to publish and maintain accurate prices and information for the 
    services we offer. Hotels provide us with the price and other information related to these services. In the 
    event, however, that a service is listed or provided to us at an incorrect price or with incorrect information 
    due to typographical error or other error in pricing or service information received from a hotel, we retain 
    the right to refuse or cancel any Requests placed for such service. We shall have the right to refuse or 
    cancel any such Requests whether or not the order has been confirmed and/or your credit card charged. 
    If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your Request is canceled because of 
    incorrect hotel information, we will promptly issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount 
    of the charge. Prices, rates and inventory are subject to availability from the hotel.
3. Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service
Priceline's Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service are hotel services whereby Priceline acts as the merchant of record on the transaction (i.e., directly charges your form of payment and not the hotel).
Hotel bookings made available through Priceline's Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service are subject to the disclosed terms and conditions on your contract page and the disclosed terms and conditions of the applicable hotel you select.
The 'Total Charges' that you will pay for using our Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service will always be disclosed to you before you submit your Request. For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told both a) the total charges to your method of payment and b) the total cost, which includes the total charges to your method of payment and the mandatory fee or resort fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Your Total Charges and the Room Rate may include compensation to us for our facilitation services.
Charges for Taxes and Service Fees:
In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, we will charge your method of payment for Taxes and for Service Fees. This charge includes an anticipated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we anticipate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Service Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Service Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.
Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, bill all applicable taxes to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.
For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your debit or credit card for Taxes and Fees includes an additional payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.
Depending on the property you stay at you may also be charged (i) certain mandatory hotel specific service fees, for example, resort fees (which typically apply to resort type destinations and, if applicable, may range from $10 to $40 per day), energy surcharges, newspaper delivery fees, in-room safe fees, tourism fees, or housekeeping fees and/or (ii) certain optional incidental fees, for example, parking charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service and movie rentals, etc.. These charges, if applicable, will be payable by you to the hotel directly at checkout. When you check in, a credit card or, in the hotel's discretion, a debit card, will be required to secure these charges and fees that you may incur during your stay. Please contact the hotel directly as to whether and which charges or service fees apply.
For bookings in Canada, the charges may also include destination marketing fees collected by the hotel and passed along to tourist bureaus. If you are a citizen of a country other than the United States and you travel to your home country, you may owe additional taxes to the hotel at check out. Contact the hotel if you have questions.
Merchant Price Disclosed Bookings of Hotel Reservations Through Agoda.com:
Certain merchant model hotel reservations at properties in Asia are provided by priceline.com through its foreign affiliate Agoda Company Pte Ltd. (Agoda.com), which is headquartered and operates in Bangkok, Thailand. If your booking is one being provided through Agoda.com, you will be notified in the Important Information section of your priceline.com contract page shown to you prior to your booking your reservation on priceline.com. Your credit card will be charged by Agoda/ Priceline.
4. Agency Hotel Service
For Priceline's Agency Hotel Service, Priceline is not the merchant of record and does not charge your credit card or other form of payment. For these transactions, you will be notified in the 'Important Information' section of your contract page that your credit card will be used to guarantee the reservation. You will also be told in the 'Important Information' section that the hotel will charge you directly for room and tax and any other charges. You will be provided with a 'Total Estimated Charges' line item on your contract page that will provide you with an estimate of what the hotel will charge you, which will include taxes.
Certain of our Agency hotel offerings, including those labeled as either 'Pay When You Stay®' or 'Book Now, Pay LaterSM, are provided by priceline.com through its foreign affiliate Booking.com B.V., which is headquartered and operates in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Through the Agency Hotel Service, priceline.com and/or Booking.com B.V. (as the case may be), provides an online platform through which hotels (including other types of temporary accommodation) can advertise their rooms for reservation, and through which visitors to the website can make reservations. By making an Agency Hotel Service reservation, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the hotel at which you book. From the point at which you make your Agency Hotel Service reservation, priceline.com and/or Booking.com B.V. (as the case may be), acts solely as an intermediary between you and the hotel, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant hotel and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the hotel.
For Agency Hotel Service transactions, the information that we disclose regarding each hotel is based on the information provided to us by the hotel. As such, the hotels are given access to a platform through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability and other information which is displayed on our website. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our services, we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our website or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each hotel remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates and availability) displayed. Hotels offered through our Agency Hotel Service do not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement by us of (the quality, service level or rating of) any hotel made available.
Charges for Taxes and Service Fees:
We will not charge you when you complete an Agency transaction. You will be charged directly by the hotel. Unless expressly stated, taxes and service fees are excluded from your room cost, but are shown to you in the 'Taxes and Fees' line.  Taxes are included in the Total Estimated Charges.  For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told the Hotel Mandatory Fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Any mandatory fee is also included in the 'Total Estimated Charges' line.
All 'Pay When You Stay®'/'Book Now, Pay LaterSM' hotel service prices are per room for your entire stay and are displayed including VAT (value added tax) and all other taxes, unless stated differently. Sometimes cheaper rates are available for a specific stay at a hotel, however, these rates made by hotels may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund. Please check the room and rate details through conditions prior to making your reservation.
Credit card:
Agency Hotel Service reservations require credit or debit card details in order to guarantee your reservation. As such, we will send your credit or debit card information directly to the hotel at which your booking is made and we may verify (i.e. pre-authorize) your credit card as well.
For certain rates or special offers that state that a deposit is required (which will be disclosed in the Important Information section of your contract page), please note that your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged by the hotel (sometimes without any option for refund) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
Cancellation:
You accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that hotel, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the hotel that may apply to your reservation or during your stay, including for services rendered and/or products offered by the hotel (the delivery terms and conditions of a hotel can be obtained with the relevant hotel). The general cancellation and no-show policy is made available on our website at the hotel information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or special offers that require an upfront deposit to the hotel (which will be disclosed in the Important Information Section of your contract page) are not eligible for cancellation or change. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
If you wish to review, adjust or cancel, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the hotel's cancellation and no-show policy. We recommend that you read the cancellation and no-show policy of the hotel carefully prior to making an Agency Hotel Service reservation.
5. Express Deals Hotel Service
Additional Restrictions:
In addition to the restrictions described above in the Merchant 
        Price Disclosed Hotel Service Section, the following restrictions apply to priceline.com's Express Deals hotel service:
All hotel reservations are non-cancelable, non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable by you. 
                Once you purchase a reservation, your method of payment will be charged for the amount shown - regardless 
                of whether or not the reservation is used. Credit will not be given for any unused reservations and cannot 
                be used toward any future purchases.

                    hotel's discretion, debit card, in his or her name that is consistent with the transactional 
                    details provided to priceline.com (the amount of available credit required will vary by hotel). 
                    Debit cards may not be accepted.
We or the applicable hotel may, on an exception basis and at the request of the hotel guest, 
                    waive one or more of the restrictions after the hotel room has been booked. We may, in our 
                    discretion, impose additional obligations and/or fees in connection with any such waiver.

                    below) disclosed to you before booking, to your method of payment. The price listed is per 
                    night and does not include priceline.com's charge to you for Taxes and Fees.
Mandatory Fees:
For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told both a) the total charges to your method of payment and b) the total cost, which includes the total charges to your method of payment and the mandatory fee or resort fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Your Total Charges and the Room Rate may include compensation to priceline.com for our facilitation services.
Charges for Taxes and Service Fees:
In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, 
        we will charge your method of payment for Taxes and Fees. This charge includes an anticipated amount to 
        recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel 
        including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax 
        and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service 
        fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the 
        hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount 
        we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we 
        retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, 
        for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors 
        including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be 
        staying, and may include profit that we retain.
Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable 
            taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, bill all applicable taxes to us and we pay over 
            such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we 
            book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the 
            type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.
For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your method of 
            payment for Taxes and Fees includes an additional payment of tax that we are required to collect and 
            remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.
For bookings in Canada, the charges may also include destination marketing fees collected by the 
            hotel and passed along to tourist bureaus.   If you are a citizen of a country other than the 
            United States and you travel to your home country, you may owe additional taxes to the hotel at 
            check out. Contact the hotel if you have questions.
Hotel Accommodations and Special Requests:
Express Deals hotel reservations 
        are guaranteed for double occupancy (one double bed or two twin beds). Bedding type maybe selected 
        for certain Express Deals. Priceline.com requests that our hotel suppliers provide non-smoking rooms. 
        However, room assignments are based on hotel availability and are at the hotel's discretion. We 
        cannot guarantee a non-smoking room, nor can we guarantee you will have one bed or two. If you have 
        special requests (including, for example, preferences for smoking or nonsmoking rooms, a specific 
        room, particular bedding, floor location, closeness to an elevator, connecting rooms, or pet 
        accommodations), you must call the hotel and verify that special requests can be met after you have 
        made your booking. Priceline.com has no control over which room a hotel will assign to you, Priceline.com 
        cannot accommodate special requests in advance of your booking and cannot guarantee that special requests 
        will be met. A hotel reservation cannot be refunded, canceled or modified on the basis that a special 
        request was not (or could not be) met by the hotel.
Disability Needs:
If you have disability needs (for example only, you need a wheelchair 
        accessible room or require the use of a service animal) you must call the hotel after your booking is 
        made and verify that your needs can be met. If your disability needs cannot be accommodated by the hotel, 
        please call Priceline customer service. Priceline.com has no control over which room a hotel will assign

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SKIPLAGGED REWARDS PROGRAM.
These Terms and Conditions (these “Terms”) apply to your access to, and participation in, the 
    Skiplagged Rewards Program (the “Program”), which is operated by Skiplagged, Inc. (“Skiplagged”). 
    Skiplagged reserves the right to change, modify and/or terminate the Program and/or all or any 
    portion of these Terms or any policy, FAQ, or guideline pertaining to the Program at any time and in 
    its sole discretion. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions 
    to
www.skiplagged.com/terms
, and you waive any right you may 
    have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your participation in the Program confirms 
    your acceptance of these Terms and any such changes or modifications; therefore, you should review these 
    Terms and applicable policies, such as Skiplagged’s General Terms, Privacy Policy and FAQs, frequently 
    to understand the terms and conditions that apply to the Program. If you do not agree to these Terms 
    in their entirety, you are not authorized to create an account or to participate in the Program in any 
    manner. Skiplagged’s General Terms and Privacy Policy are available 
    at:
skiplagged.com/terms
.
The Program is intended for personal use only. Commercial use is prohibited. The Program is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 18.
Please read Skiplagged’s Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Skiplagged collects, uses and discloses information about users and customers.
How the Program Works
To participate in the Program, visit the Rewards page by clicking here. Sign up to create a 
    Skiplagged account by providing a valid email address and creating a password. Then, find 
    a great flight or hotel deal and book it yourself or share it with others through your 
    personalized “https://skiplagged.com/r/” link (“Personalized Link”).
For every flight or hotel you book on Skiplagged, or when others book flights or hotels on Skiplagged through your Personalized Link, you may be eligible to receive “Rewards” (defined below), provided you are otherwise eligible under, and fully compliant with, these Terms. Skiplagged reserves the right to disqualify you at any time from participation in the Program if you do not comply with any part of these Terms.
Eligibility
You must be 18 years or older.
When sharing flights and hotels, you must have the legal right to provide the personal information (e.g., name and email address) of individuals you share your Personalized Link with.
Earning Rewards
You may earn travel credits valued at up to twenty-five dollars ($25 USD) that may be redeemed for flights and hotels booked through Skiplagged (“Reward(s)”) for each valid and verified flight or hotel booked by you or each time another person books a flight or hotel using your Personalized Link. Referrals, created by sharing a flight, a hotel, or Personalized Link, expire after 30 days. The amount of the Reward for any particular booking will be determined by Skiplagged in its sole discretion (but shall in no event exceed twenty-five dollars ($25 USD). A flight or hotel booked by another person will qualify for a Reward if s/he follows the link provided in your invitation and books the shared flight or hotel on skiplagged.com.
Not all flights and hotels are eligible for earning Rewards. Eligible flights are those booked directly on skiplagged.com. Eligible hotels have rooms labeled “Skiplagged rate.”
You may not earn Rewards when you book flights or hotels with Rewards.
You may not earn Rewards by booking flights or hotels on Skiplagged’s iOS or Android apps.
Redeeming Rewards
To redeem Rewards, log-in to your Skiplagged account. Select a flight or hotel. Then, on the booking page, choose to pay with your “Travel Credits.” If the credit is sufficient, hit “Pay with travel credits.”
Rewards can only be redeemed if the amount is equal to or greater than the flight or hotel you are looking to purchase. You must have earned at least twenty dollars ($20 USD) in Rewards to start redeeming. Your last seven (7) days of earnings are locked for fraud prevention.
Rewards are subject to verification. Skiplagged may withhold a Reward for investigation, or refuse to process any transaction it deems fraudulent, suspicious, in violation of these Terms, or believes will impose liability on Skiplagged or any of its officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents. Rewards are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered, sold or redeemed for cash. Upon termination of the Program or any portion thereof for any reason any unredeemed Rewards accumulated by you are forfeited.
Skiplagged’s decisions are final and binding, including decisions as to whether a booking or Reward is valid.
Liability
By participating in the Program, you agree: (a) to be bound by these Terms, the decisions of Skiplagged and/or its designee, and Skiplagged’s General Terms and Privacy Policy; (b) to release and hold harmless Skiplagged and its employees, directors, officers, licensees, licensors, shareholders, attorneys and agents including, without limitation, their respective advertising and promotion entities and any person or entity associated with the production, operation or administration of the Program, from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses caused by, arising out of, in connection with or related to the Program; and (c) to be contacted by Skiplagged via email. You further agree that the Program and Rewards are provided “as is where is.” SKIPLAGGED MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, THIRD PARTIES RIGHTS, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OR ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.
As a condition of participating in the Program, you agree that under no circumstances will you be entitled to recover any actual or direct damages. In no event will Skiplagged be liable to you for any consequential, incidental, indirect or special damages (including, without limitation, lost profits, savings or use), or any punitive or exemplary damages, even if Skiplagged has been advised of the possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any third party.
Skiplagged’s failure to enforce any term of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
The laws of certain states or other jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply, some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations may not apply to your, and you may have rights in addition to those contained in these Terms. In such jurisdictions, Skiplagged’s liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
Arbitration; Applicable Law
This Program is void where prohibited by law.
Any dispute that in any way relates to or arises out of these Terms, the Program or any Reward shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York. The arbitration, as well as the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms and the Program, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without reference to its conflict of laws principles). Any award in an arbitration initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount. Except as may be required by law, neither party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.
These Terms do not allow class or collective arbitrations even if the AAA procedures or rules would. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, the arbitrator may award money only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. No class or representative theories of liability or prayers for relief may be maintained in any arbitration held under these Terms. Any question regarding the enforceability or interpretation of this paragraph shall be decided by a court and not the arbitrator.
If either Skiplagged or you intend to seek arbitration under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Skiplagged should be sent to [Skiplagged, Inc. PO Box 318 New York, NY 10116]. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.
An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.
If for some reason the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth above cannot be enforced as to all or part of a dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that dispute or part of the dispute.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and Skiplagged agree that there will not be a jury trial. You and Skiplagged unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to these Terms in any way. In the event of litigation, this paragraph may be filed to show a written consent to a trial by the court. Any and all claims and causes of action arising out of or related to this Program or any Reward shall be resolved under New York law (without reference to its conflict of laws principles).
Bulk Distribution
Bulk email distribution, distribution to strangers, or any other promotion of a Personalized Link in a manner that would constitute or appear to constitute unsolicited commercial email or “spam” in Skiplagged’s sole discretion is expressly prohibited and may be grounds for immediate termination of your account and deactivation of your Personalized Link.
Fraudulent and Suspicious Behavior
Skiplagged may prohibit you from participating in the Program or receiving a Reward, in its sole discretion, if it determines you are attempting to undermine the fairness, integrity or legitimate operation of the Program in any way by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other fraudulent behavior or unethical conduct. Use of any automated system to participate in the Program is strictly prohibited and will result in disqualification. You may not register with multiple or fake email addresses or accounts, use fictitious identities or use any system, bot or other device or artifice to participate in the Program or receive a Reward. Skiplagged reserves the right to disqualify you and/or cancel any Reward(s) it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Program or violating these Terms.

10. SECURITY
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we employ 
    procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to help safeguard the information we collect. Only authorized Skiplagged

    on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to such information.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, despite our efforts, 
    we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We do not warrant or represent that personal information about you will be protected against, loss, 
    misuse, or alteration by third parties.
If you use the Services, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and password. You are responsible for

    any personal information that you release on your own, that you request us to release or that is released through another third party to whom you've given access.
Where required under applicable law or by contract, we will notify the appropriate parties or individuals of any loss, misuse or alteration of 
    personal information so that such parties or individuals can take the appropriate actions for the due protection of their rights. If such personal information is 
    information of a Skiplagged customer, we will notify such customer and coordinate with them regarding any required notices to particular individuals.

Arbitration and Dispute Resolution
Disputes and Arbitration
Priceline is committed to customer satisfaction.  If you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve it.  If we are unsuccessful, you may pursue your claim as explained in this section.
You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any problem, dispute, or claim relating in any way to the Priceline websites and/or any of its related applications or services (the 'Site'); any dealings with our customer service agents; the purchase, use, or performance of any services or products available through this Site; any representations made by Priceline; or our Privacy Policy (collectively, 'Claims') by providing Notice to Customer Support as described in section I.A.2.b below.  If we are unable to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, without regard to conflict of law's provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.   All Claims or other matters in dispute between you or any Third-party (as defined in paragraph K above) and Priceline, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of law's provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
Limitation on Claims
Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, any Claim must be brought within two (2) years from the date on which such Claim arose or accrued.
Mandatory Arbitration
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY.  IT REQUIRES THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, AND IT PREVENTS YOU FROM PURSUING A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING IN ANY FORUM.  THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS AGAINST PRICELINE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR COMPANIES OFFERING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE SITE.
IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY.  THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION WILL GENERALLY BE FINAL AND BINDING, WITH NO RIGHT OF APPEAL.  ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT PROCEDURES.
By using this Site, you, any Third-party (as defined in paragraph K above), and Priceline agree that any 
                Claim, including claims regarding the applicability or validity of this arbitration provision, shall be 
                resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association 
                ('AAA') and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the then applicable Rules and Procedures 
                established by AAA ('Rules and Procedures'), except that, pursuant to subsection (e) below, under no 
                circumstances may any claim be brought or arbitrated as a class action or be joined with another person's claim, 
                or proceed on a basis involving claims brought on a purported representative capacity (either on behalf of the 
                general public or other users or persons). As an exception to arbitration, you, any Third-party, and Priceline 
                retain the right to pursue in a small claims court located in the federal judicial district that includes your 
                or the Third-party's billing address at the time of the Claim, any Claim that is within the court's jurisdiction 
                and proceeds on an individual basis.  All Claims you or a Third-party bring against Priceline, its subsidiaries 
                or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site 
                must be resolved in accordance with this Disputes and Arbitration Section.  All Claims filed or brought 
                contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed and void.
If you decide to seek arbitration, you must first send, by certified mail, a written Notice of 
                Dispute ('Notice') addressed to:  Legal Department, priceline.com LLC, 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, CT 06854 
                ('Notice Address').  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (ii) set forth the specific 
                relief sought.  If Priceline and you, or Priceline and any Third-party, do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim 
                within 60 days after the Notice is received, you, or the Third-party, may commence an arbitration proceeding. 
                During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after 
                the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you, any Third-party, or Priceline is entitled. 
                A form to initiate arbitration may be downloaded
here
.
The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures 
                (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you, or any Third-party asserting a Claim), 
                or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon.
To the extent that any Claim is held not to be subject to arbitration and proceeds in a Court 
                other than small claims court, such Claim shall be filed only in the United States District Court for 
                Connecticut or, if there is no federal jurisdiction over the action, in the courts of the State of 
                Connecticut located in Fairfield County, Connecticut. You hereby consent and submit to the personal 
                jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such Claim that is not subject to the 
                arbitration provision and not pursued in small claims court, and agree that any such claim shall be 
                resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action (as described more fully in 
                section I.A.2.e below).  You further agree that any and all Claims or other matters asserted in such 
                dispute, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of 
                the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of law's provisions that would result in the 
                application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
YOU AND ANY THIRD-PARTY FURTHER AGREE THAT NO PROCEEDING AGAINST PRICELINE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR 
                AFFILIATES, OR ANY TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR COMPANIES OFFERING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH 
                THE SITE (UNDER THIS PROVISION OR OTHERWISE) MAY PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION, BE JOINED WITH ANOTHER 
                PERSON'S CLAIM, OR PROCEED ON A BASIS INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY 
                (EITHER ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR OTHER USERS OR PERSONS).  ANY AND ALL PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE 
                CLAIMS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  IN ADDITION, NO ARBITRATION PROCEEDING UNDER THIS 
                PROVISION SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED OR JOINED IN ANY WAY WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE 
                EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES.
For any arbitration involving Claims that together seek damages that do not exceed $25,000, Priceline 
                will reimburse you for all fees and costs imposed by AAA. If you are unable to pay the filing fee, 
                Priceline will pay it for you.  For any arbitration involving Claims that together seek damages 
                that exceed $25,000, if you, or any Third-party, prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against Priceline, 
                Priceline will reimburse such prevailing party for any fees or costs the prevailing party paid to AAA in 
                connection with the arbitration.
If you prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against Priceline and are awarded an amount greater than 
                Priceline's last written settlement offer to you, Priceline will pay a minimum recovery of $5,000, and 
                Priceline will reimburse you for all reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in arbitrating the Claim(s) 
                upon which you have prevailed.  If any Third-party prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against 
                Priceline and is awarded an amount greater than Priceline's last written settlement offer to such Third-party, 
                Priceline will pay a minimum recovery of $5,000 to the Third-party, and Priceline will reimburse such 
                Third-party for all reasonable attorney's fees incurred in arbitrating the Claim upon which he or 
                she has prevailed.  Any dispute regarding attorney's fees to be paid pursuant to this paragraph will be 
                decided by the arbitrator who decided the underlying Claim. If you or the Third-party do not prevail on 
                the claim or prevail but are awarded an amount less than or equal to Priceline's last written settlement 
                offer to you, Priceline will pay only the amount of the award, not the minimum recovery or attorneys' fees.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any of the Rules and Procedures established by AAA which may 
                be to the contrary, Priceline will not be entitled to seek reimbursement of its attorney's fees for any 
                Claim the arbitrator finds to be non-frivolous.
With the exception of sub-part (e) above (the class action waiver), if any part of this arbitration provision 
                is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established 
                by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance 
                with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.  
                If, however, subpart (e) above (the class action waiver) is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then 
                the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor any Third-party, nor Priceline 
                shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
Arbitration rules and forms may be obtained from AAA at
http://www.adr.org
or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
IF YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY DO NOT CHOOSE TO ACCEPT THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU OR SUCH THIRD-PARTY MUST 
                NOTIFY PRICELINE IN WRITING BY CERTIFIED MAIL WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF YOUR PURCHASE OR BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO USE 
                THE SERVICES PURCHASED ON THIS SITE, WHICHEVER DATE IS SOONER.  SUCH NOTICE SHALL BE SENT TO THE NOTICE ADDRESS 
                DEFINED IN SUBSECTION (b), ABOVE.  IF YOU SO NOTIFY US BY THAT TIME THAT YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE BINDING ARBITRATION 
                PROVISION, YOU AND ANY SUCH THIRD-PARTY MAY NOT CONTINUE TO PURCHASE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS ON THIS SITE UNLESS AND 
                UNTIL PRICELINE NOTIFIES YOU OR SUCH THIRD-PARTY OTHERWISE. PRICELINE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROHIBIT YOUR AND

B. Hotel Service Restrictions
1. General
Check In:
Upon check-in, the reservation holder must present a valid 
        ID and credit card or, in the hotel's discretion, debit card, in his or her name 
        (the amount of available credit required will vary by hotel). Debit cards may not be accepted.
Double Occupancy:
All hotel reservations are guaranteed for double occupancy 
        (i.e. 2 adults) and accommodations for more than two adults are not guaranteed. Some hotels may 
        not allow extra guests.  If your hotel does allow extra guests, there may be additional charges. 
        These charges vary and will be payable directly to the hotel.
Late Arrival and Failure to Check-in on First Night:
While you should call 
        Priceline if you wish to cancel a cancellable reservation in advance of your stay, if you are 
        going to be delayed on your date of check in or find that you cannot check in to your hotel on 
        the date you requested, you should contact the hotel to let them know. If you fail to check in 
        to your hotel on the day of your reservation and do not alert the hotel, the remaining portion 
        of your reservation may be canceled and you may not be entitled to a refund, depending on the 
        terms and conditions of the applicable hotel.
Cancellations and Changes to Your Reservation:
Hotel cancellation policies vary. 
        Certain reservations are non-cancellable and non-changeable. Others require you to pay a penalty 
        if you cancel. Still others are fully refundable. Check the hotel cancellation policy when you book. 
        If changes to your pre-paid reservation are allowed, any changes to a pre-paid reservation are only 
        permitted as a cancellation and booking of a new reservation. Disability Needs: If you have disability 
        needs (for example only, you need a wheelchair accessible room or require the use of a service animal) 
        you must call the hotel and verify that disability needs can be met. If your disability needs cannot 
        be accommodated by the hotel, please call Priceline customer service.
Hotel Accommodations and Special Requests:
Depending upon which Priceline hotel 
        reservation service you use, you may or may not be able to select your room type and number and type of 
        beds. Room assignments are based on hotel availability and are at the hotel's discretion. We cannot 
        guarantee a non-smoking room. If you have special requests (including, for example, preferences for 
        smoking or nonsmoking rooms, a specific room, particular bedding, floor location, closeness to an elevator, 
        connecting rooms, or pet accommodations), you must call the hotel and verify that special requests can be 
        met after you have made your booking. Since Priceline has no control over which room a hotel will assign 
        to you, Priceline cannot accommodate special requests in advance of your booking and cannot guarantee that 
        special requests will be met.
Must be 21 Years of Age:
The guest on the reservation must be 21 years or older to check into the hotel.
Frequent Traveler Points:
Frequent traveler points, upgrades, certificate vouchers and other discounts or 
        incentives may not apply to Priceline's hotel services.
Hotel Star Ratings (General):
Priceline's star rating system is provided for your reference. Like other 
        well-known hotel rating systems, Priceline considers a number of factors in evaluating the quality of participating 
        hotels such as: amenities, facilities, reputation, brand, other rating services, customer feedback from guests who have 
        stayed at the hotel, etc., to assign a single star rating. Priceline screens participating hotels carefully and updates 
        our information periodically to ensure the validity of our ratings. Our ratings systems may sometimes differ from those 
        of other rating systems that you may be familiar with. We do not warrant or guarantee that our star rating system is equal 
        to or consistent with any other star rating system and reserve the right to change a hotel's rating at any time with or without 
        notice.
Accommodation Types:
Priceline offers its customers various properties, including hotels, motels, 
        bed and breakfasts, resorts and other types of rentable accommodations.
2. Prices
Sometimes cheaper rates are available for a specific stay at a hotel; however, these rates made by hotels may 
    carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund. Please check the 
    room and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
Pricing Errors:
We endeavor to publish and maintain accurate prices and information for the 
    services we offer. Hotels provide us with the price and other information related to these services. In the 
    event, however, that a service is listed or provided to us at an incorrect price or with incorrect information 
    due to typographical error or other error in pricing or service information received from a hotel, we retain 
    the right to refuse or cancel any Requests placed for such service. We shall have the right to refuse or 
    cancel any such Requests whether or not the order has been confirmed and/or your credit card charged. 
    If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your Request is canceled because of 
    incorrect hotel information, we will promptly issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount 
    of the charge. Prices, rates and inventory are subject to availability from the hotel.
3. Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service
Priceline's Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service are hotel services whereby Priceline acts as the merchant of record on the transaction (i.e., directly charges your form of payment and not the hotel).
Hotel bookings made available through Priceline's Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service are subject to the disclosed terms and conditions on your contract page and the disclosed terms and conditions of the applicable hotel you select.
The 'Total Charges' that you will pay for using our Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service will always be disclosed to you before you submit your Request. For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told both a) the total charges to your method of payment and b) the total cost, which includes the total charges to your method of payment and the mandatory fee or resort fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Your Total Charges and the Room Rate may include compensation to us for our facilitation services.
Charges for Taxes and Service Fees:
In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, we will charge your method of payment for Taxes and for Service Fees. This charge includes an anticipated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we anticipate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Service Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Service Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.
Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, bill all applicable taxes to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.
For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your debit or credit card for Taxes and Fees includes an additional payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.
Depending on the property you stay at you may also be charged (i) certain mandatory hotel specific service fees, for example, resort fees (which typically apply to resort type destinations and, if applicable, may range from $10 to $40 per day), energy surcharges, newspaper delivery fees, in-room safe fees, tourism fees, or housekeeping fees and/or (ii) certain optional incidental fees, for example, parking charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service and movie rentals, etc.. These charges, if applicable, will be payable by you to the hotel directly at checkout. When you check in, a credit card or, in the hotel's discretion, a debit card, will be required to secure these charges and fees that you may incur during your stay. Please contact the hotel directly as to whether and which charges or service fees apply.
For bookings in Canada, the charges may also include destination marketing fees collected by the hotel and passed along to tourist bureaus. If you are a citizen of a country other than the United States and you travel to your home country, you may owe additional taxes to the hotel at check out. Contact the hotel if you have questions.
Merchant Price Disclosed Bookings of Hotel Reservations Through Agoda.com:
Certain merchant model hotel reservations at properties in Asia are provided by priceline.com through its foreign affiliate Agoda Company Pte Ltd. (Agoda.com), which is headquartered and operates in Bangkok, Thailand. If your booking is one being provided through Agoda.com, you will be notified in the Important Information section of your priceline.com contract page shown to you prior to your booking your reservation on priceline.com. Your credit card will be charged by Agoda/ Priceline.
4. Agency Hotel Service
For Priceline's Agency Hotel Service, Priceline is not the merchant of record and does not charge your credit card or other form of payment. For these transactions, you will be notified in the 'Important Information' section of your contract page that your credit card will be used to guarantee the reservation. You will also be told in the 'Important Information' section that the hotel will charge you directly for room and tax and any other charges. You will be provided with a 'Total Estimated Charges' line item on your contract page that will provide you with an estimate of what the hotel will charge you, which will include taxes.
Certain of our Agency hotel offerings, including those labeled as either 'Pay When You Stay®' or 'Book Now, Pay LaterSM, are provided by priceline.com through its foreign affiliate Booking.com B.V., which is headquartered and operates in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Through the Agency Hotel Service, priceline.com and/or Booking.com B.V. (as the case may be), provides an online platform through which hotels (including other types of temporary accommodation) can advertise their rooms for reservation, and through which visitors to the website can make reservations. By making an Agency Hotel Service reservation, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the hotel at which you book. From the point at which you make your Agency Hotel Service reservation, priceline.com and/or Booking.com B.V. (as the case may be), acts solely as an intermediary between you and the hotel, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant hotel and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the hotel.
For Agency Hotel Service transactions, the information that we disclose regarding each hotel is based on the information provided to us by the hotel. As such, the hotels are given access to a platform through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability and other information which is displayed on our website. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our services, we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our website or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each hotel remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates and availability) displayed. Hotels offered through our Agency Hotel Service do not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement by us of (the quality, service level or rating of) any hotel made available.
Charges for Taxes and Service Fees:
We will not charge you when you complete an Agency transaction. You will be charged directly by the hotel. Unless expressly stated, taxes and service fees are excluded from your room cost, but are shown to you in the 'Taxes and Fees' line.  Taxes are included in the Total Estimated Charges.  For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told the Hotel Mandatory Fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Any mandatory fee is also included in the 'Total Estimated Charges' line.
All 'Pay When You Stay®'/'Book Now, Pay LaterSM' hotel service prices are per room for your entire stay and are displayed including VAT (value added tax) and all other taxes, unless stated differently. Sometimes cheaper rates are available for a specific stay at a hotel, however, these rates made by hotels may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund. Please check the room and rate details through conditions prior to making your reservation.
Credit card:
Agency Hotel Service reservations require credit or debit card details in order to guarantee your reservation. As such, we will send your credit or debit card information directly to the hotel at which your booking is made and we may verify (i.e. pre-authorize) your credit card as well.
For certain rates or special offers that state that a deposit is required (which will be disclosed in the Important Information section of your contract page), please note that your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged by the hotel (sometimes without any option for refund) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
Cancellation:
You accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that hotel, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the hotel that may apply to your reservation or during your stay, including for services rendered and/or products offered by the hotel (the delivery terms and conditions of a hotel can be obtained with the relevant hotel). The general cancellation and no-show policy is made available on our website at the hotel information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or special offers that require an upfront deposit to the hotel (which will be disclosed in the Important Information Section of your contract page) are not eligible for cancellation or change. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
If you wish to review, adjust or cancel, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the hotel's cancellation and no-show policy. We recommend that you read the cancellation and no-show policy of the hotel carefully prior to making an Agency Hotel Service reservation.

Effective Date: November 28, 2018
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR PARTICIPATING IN THE SKIPLAGGED REWARDS PROGRAM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SKIPLAGGED REWARDS PROGRAM.
These Terms and Conditions (these “Terms”) apply to your access to, and participation in, the 
    Skiplagged Rewards Program (the “Program”), which is operated by Skiplagged, Inc. (“Skiplagged”). 
    Skiplagged reserves the right to change, modify and/or terminate the Program and/or all or any 
    portion of these Terms or any policy, FAQ, or guideline pertaining to the Program at any time and in 
    its sole discretion. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions 
    to
www.skiplagged.com/terms
, and you waive any right you may 
    have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your participation in the Program confirms 
    your acceptance of these Terms and any such changes or modifications; therefore, you should review these 
    Terms and applicable policies, such as Skiplagged’s General Terms, Privacy Policy and FAQs, frequently 
    to understand the terms and conditions that apply to the Program. If you do not agree to these Terms 
    in their entirety, you are not authorized to create an account or to participate in the Program in any 
    manner. Skiplagged’s General Terms and Privacy Policy are available 
    at:
skiplagged.com/terms
.
The Program is intended for personal use only. Commercial use is prohibited. The Program is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 18.
Please read Skiplagged’s Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Skiplagged collects, uses and discloses information about users and customers.
How the Program Works
To participate in the Program, visit the Rewards page by clicking here. Sign up to create a 
    Skiplagged account by providing a valid email address and creating a password. Then, find 
    a great flight or hotel deal and book it yourself or share it with others through your 
    personalized “https://skiplagged.com/r/” link (“Personalized Link”).
For every flight or hotel you book on Skiplagged, or when others book flights or hotels on Skiplagged through your Personalized Link, you may be eligible to receive “Rewards” (defined below), provided you are otherwise eligible under, and fully compliant with, these Terms. Skiplagged reserves the right to disqualify you at any time from participation in the Program if you do not comply with any part of these Terms.
Eligibility
You must be 18 years or older.
When sharing flights and hotels, you must have the legal right to provide the personal information (e.g., name and email address) of individuals you share your Personalized Link with.
Earning Rewards
You may earn travel credits valued at up to twenty-five dollars ($25 USD) that may be redeemed for flights and hotels booked through Skiplagged (“Reward(s)”) for each valid and verified flight or hotel booked by you or each time another person books a flight or hotel using your Personalized Link. Referrals, created by sharing a flight, a hotel, or Personalized Link, expire after 30 days. The amount of the Reward for any particular booking will be determined by Skiplagged in its sole discretion (but shall in no event exceed twenty-five dollars ($25 USD). A flight or hotel booked by another person will qualify for a Reward if s/he follows the link provided in your invitation and books the shared flight or hotel on skiplagged.com.
Not all flights and hotels are eligible for earning Rewards. Eligible flights are those booked directly on skiplagged.com. Eligible hotels have rooms labeled “Skiplagged rate.”
You may not earn Rewards when you book flights or hotels with Rewards.
You may not earn Rewards by booking flights or hotels on Skiplagged’s iOS or Android apps.
Redeeming Rewards
To redeem Rewards, log-in to your Skiplagged account. Select a flight or hotel. Then, on the booking page, choose to pay with your “Travel Credits.” If the credit is sufficient, hit “Pay with travel credits.”
Rewards can only be redeemed if the amount is equal to or greater than the flight or hotel you are looking to purchase. You must have earned at least twenty dollars ($20 USD) in Rewards to start redeeming. Your last seven (7) days of earnings are locked for fraud prevention.
Rewards are subject to verification. Skiplagged may withhold a Reward for investigation, or refuse to process any transaction it deems fraudulent, suspicious, in violation of these Terms, or believes will impose liability on Skiplagged or any of its officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents. Rewards are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered, sold or redeemed for cash. Upon termination of the Program or any portion thereof for any reason any unredeemed Rewards accumulated by you are forfeited.
Skiplagged’s decisions are final and binding, including decisions as to whether a booking or Reward is valid.
Liability
By participating in the Program, you agree: (a) to be bound by these Terms, the decisions of Skiplagged and/or its designee, and Skiplagged’s General Terms and Privacy Policy; (b) to release and hold harmless Skiplagged and its employees, directors, officers, licensees, licensors, shareholders, attorneys and agents including, without limitation, their respective advertising and promotion entities and any person or entity associated with the production, operation or administration of the Program, from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses caused by, arising out of, in connection with or related to the Program; and (c) to be contacted by Skiplagged via email. You further agree that the Program and Rewards are provided “as is where is.” SKIPLAGGED MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, THIRD PARTIES RIGHTS, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OR ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.
As a condition of participating in the Program, you agree that under no circumstances will you be entitled to recover any actual or direct damages. In no event will Skiplagged be liable to you for any consequential, incidental, indirect or special damages (including, without limitation, lost profits, savings or use), or any punitive or exemplary damages, even if Skiplagged has been advised of the possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any third party.
Skiplagged’s failure to enforce any term of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
The laws of certain states or other jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply, some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations may not apply to your, and you may have rights in addition to those contained in these Terms. In such jurisdictions, Skiplagged’s liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
Arbitration; Applicable Law
This Program is void where prohibited by law.
Any dispute that in any way relates to or arises out of these Terms, the Program or any Reward shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York. The arbitration, as well as the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms and the Program, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without reference to its conflict of laws principles). Any award in an arbitration initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount. Except as may be required by law, neither party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.
These Terms do not allow class or collective arbitrations even if the AAA procedures or rules would. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, the arbitrator may award money only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. No class or representative theories of liability or prayers for relief may be maintained in any arbitration held under these Terms. Any question regarding the enforceability or interpretation of this paragraph shall be decided by a court and not the arbitrator.
If either Skiplagged or you intend to seek arbitration under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Skiplagged should be sent to [Skiplagged, Inc. PO Box 318 New York, NY 10116]. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.
An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.
If for some reason the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth above cannot be enforced as to all or part of a dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that dispute or part of the dispute.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and Skiplagged agree that there will not be a jury trial. You and Skiplagged unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to these Terms in any way. In the event of litigation, this paragraph may be filed to show a written consent to a trial by the court. Any and all claims and causes of action arising out of or related to this Program or any Reward shall be resolved under New York law (without reference to its conflict of laws principles).
Bulk Distribution
Bulk email distribution, distribution to strangers, or any other promotion of a Personalized Link in a manner that would constitute or appear to constitute unsolicited commercial email or “spam” in Skiplagged’s sole discretion is expressly prohibited and may be grounds for immediate termination of your account and deactivation of your Personalized Link.
Fraudulent and Suspicious Behavior
Skiplagged may prohibit you from participating in the Program or receiving a Reward, in its sole discretion, if it determines you are attempting to undermine the fairness, integrity or legitimate operation of the Program in any way by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other fraudulent behavior or unethical conduct. Use of any automated system to participate in the Program is strictly prohibited and will result in disqualification. You may not register with multiple or fake email addresses or accounts, use fictitious identities or use any system, bot or other device or artifice to participate in the Program or receive a Reward. Skiplagged reserves the right to disqualify you and/or cancel any Reward(s) it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Program or violating these Terms.
