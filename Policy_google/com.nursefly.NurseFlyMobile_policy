Device Data: Technical data about your computer or device, like your IP address, device type, operating system type and version, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, your device's OS and other systems data. We also collect your approximate geographic location, like country, city, and approximate geographic coordinates, calculated based on your IP address. We may also allocate to you a unique browser ID by placing a cookie on your browser.
Usage Data: Usage statistics about your interactions with our website, including the last page you were on before clicking to our website, pages of our website you visited, content you accessed, time you spent on pages, features you used, your search queries, click data, online chat communications, and the date and time of these activities.
The personal information listed above is collected through the use of server log files and tracking technologies, as detailed in the
“Cookies and Data Collection Tools”
Section. We use this personal information to identify new and returning visitors, and their usage and access preferences. We also may use this information in aggregate to analyze usage of the Vivian Platform. This enables us to improve the design, content and offerings on the Vivian Platform, and to personalize your experience (for instance, to recognize you by name when you return to our platform, to present content in the language of your browser, or to promote certain content or features to you).
If you create an account with Vivian, all Device Data and Usage Data will become associated with your account.
You Create a Healthcare Professional Account
In order to use certain features (like applying for a job), you need to create a user account. When you create an account, including through a third-party platform like LinkedIn or Facebook, we collect and store any personal information you provide, such as:
Account Data: When you create or update your account, we collect and store certain personal information like your first and last name, email address, and password. You may provide us additional personal information to complete your profile like your phone number, date of birth, last four digits of your social security number, work history, references, education, certifications, Covid 19 vaccination status, and associated documentation and other professional information, as well as your account settings. We assign your account a unique identifying number. We may also associate with your account a badge or other distinction showing your qualification for a special program
Social Media Sign-in: Vivian may enable you to create an account and log in using sign-in services such as Facebook and LinkedIn. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information from your Facebook or LinkedIn account with us. If you log in using your Facebook or LinkedIn profile, we may receive personal information like your name, profile picture, age information, language, email address, and friend / connections list. All such information is then added to your Account Data.
Account Activity Data: When you are logged into your account, all your activities on the Vivian platform are associated with your account, including your job applications and information you provide (such as completed skills checklists), your interactions with recruiters, potential employers, or Vivian staff, including via email, SMS messages, and push notifications, and how you respond or interact with these messages. Any previous Device Data and Usage Data is also associated with your account.
Live Chat: Vivian provides a chat service enabling you to have real time conversations with a recruiter or an AI agent to answer questions on behalf of the recruiter. Such chat messages are stored by Vivian.
Social programs: if you participate in any loyalty or other special program, you may be requested to provide additional information for the administration of the program such as your paystub, or a completed W9 tax form which may include your social security number. We do not share any such information with anyone.
You use the Vivian Mobile Application
If you are a healthcare professional, you may create and access your account via our mobile app and use the Vivian platform and associated services through the app. In such case, we collect the same Account Data and associated Account Activity Data as if you were using the vivian.com website. We will also assign your app install a unique ID and will also receive the unique identifier that is tied to your app store account ID (such as Google Play or iTunes/Appstore or Amazon Appstore).
You Apply for a Job
When you respond to a job posting on Vivian, additional information and documentation may be requested from you by a healthcare facility or agency in order to process your application (job submission data). Such information may be uploaded to the Vivian platform by the agency for further sharing with the agency's or healthcare facility's systems. In such case Vivian is following the instructions of the agency or healthcare facility and acting as a service provider or processor under the
Data Processing Agreement
between Vivian and its customers.
You serve as reference for a candidate
The Vivian platform enables candidates to provide the name and contact information (phone number and email) of individuals who may be contacted by Vivian to serve as professional references.  We encourage candidates to ensure they receive consent of references prior to sharing reference personal information with us. We use this information  solely for contacting references in connection with the candidate, creating a candidate reference form and storing such form in our platform together with the candidate profile, to make it available to recruiters who are interested in the candidate. To request the deletion of your contact information from Vivian's platform and systems, please contact us at
support@vivian.com
.
See also your specific rights under the
State Specific Disclosures and Rights
section of this Privacy Policy.
You Participate in a Loyalty Program
In order to earn rewards under certain loyalty programs, you may be required to provide a pay stub to enable Vivian to verify that you have been hired for a job via the Vivian platform. Vivian will collect and use your pay stub information for such verification. Vivian will not share your pay stub information with anyone. Your pay stub may contain your full social security number, which is not required for Vivian's verification. You should redact your social security number prior to uploading your pay stub to the Vivian platform.
You Use an Employer/Recruiter Account
Vivian provides its enterprise customers (“Customers”) services by connecting them to our jobs marketplace. In the course of providing such services, Vivian will receive and have access to personal information of individual users to whom Customers grant access (“Authorized Users”). For the purposes of US privacy laws, Customers are businesses or controllers and Vivian is a service provider or processor and processes Authorized Users data in accordance with the
Data Processing Agreement

Authorized Users may be employees or independent contractors of Customers. Customers decide which individuals are given access to Vivian's services. Personal information processed by Vivian regarding Authorized Users includes the first and last name, professional email address, assigned Authorized User ID, when Authorized Users access our platform, and their activities on our platform while they are logged into their account, such as the candidate profiles they review, and communications with candidates and with our staff (including via chat, email, SMS messages, and push notifications).

Authorized Users should contact Customers (their employer) for assistance with any requests or questions relating to the processing of their personal information in connection with their use of Vivian’s services.

The full terms and conditions of any such challenge, contest or sweepstakes (“Promotion”) will be set forth where the opportunity to enter the Promotion is offered. To administer a Promotion and fulfill prizes to the winners, we may collect additional personal information about you when you enter the promotion, or once you have become eligible for receiving a prize, such as your postal address. We may also disclose such personal information with our prize fulfillment vendors.
You Contact Our Support Team
You may contact our support team to report a problem or concern, or you may contact us via a “contact us” feature on the Vivian platform. When you do, we collect and store your email address and the content of your message, as well as the content of any response we provide.
