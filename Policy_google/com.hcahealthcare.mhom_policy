We respect your privacy and take internet
privacy and information security very seriously. Please read the following
information in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) carefully.
This Privacy Policy covers our online privacy
practices with respect to use and/or disclosure of information we may collect
from you when you access or use MyHealthONE. "MyHealthONE" is a
website and mobile application designed to offer you access to some of your
records at affiliated facilities, as well as certain internet-based services
which may include assistance in finding a doctor, assistance in scheduling
appointments, the ability to register for classes and pre-register for
procedures, and health and patient education materials.
This Privacy Policy applies only to
MyHealthONE and its related services (the "Services" or
"MyHealthONE"), which are provided by HCA – HealthONE LLC and its
affiliates (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to
information collected through other means, such as by telephone or in person.
Please review our privacy practices and
email our privacy team

This Privacy Policy
does not apply to
information that would be considered “Protected Health Information”
under
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). HCA
HealthCare’s’ use and disclosure of Protected Health Information is set forth
in the HCA Healthcare
Notice of Privacy Practices
, which can be accessed
at the bottom of the applicable facility website.
IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS
PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE
SERVICES OR BY CLICKING OR TAPPING "I AGREE," OR TAKING SIMILAR
ACTION TO INDICATE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE
READ, ACCEPTED, AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT
AGREE TO ALL OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE
SERVICES AND, IF APPLICABLE, DELETE THE MOBILE APPLICATION FROM YOUR MOBILE
DEVICE. IF YOU CLICK ON THE “I DECLINE” BUTTON, OR TAKE SIMILAR ACTION TO NOT
ACCEPT THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO USE OR RECEIVE THE BENEFIT
OF THE SERVICES.
We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time
and from time to time in our sole discretion. We will use reasonable means to
notify you in writing prior to any such changes taking effect. Despite notice
in some cases, you should regularly review this Privacy Policy carefully in
order to make sure that you are aware of the most current terms and conditions
for the use of the Services, because any use of the Services by you after any
change to this Privacy Policy, whether or not you have reviewed the updated
Privacy Policy, constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy as updated.
Unless otherwise indicated, any new content or Services added to MyHealthONE
will also be subject to these terms and conditions effective upon the date of
any such addition.
Information Collected through
MyHealthONE
The type and amount of Personal Information
we collect about you depends on how you use MyHealthONE. As used in this
Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information that may
be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally
identify an individual as defined by applicable state law as noted below.
We collect certain information, including
Personal Information, from and about MyHealthONE users in three ways:
Directly from you;
Directly from our web
     server logs; or
Cookies and web beacons.
Information Provided by You
MyHealthONE includes certain features for
your benefit that will not function properly unless we collect and use Personal
Information. For example, MyHealthONE can provide you with access to some of
your medical records. When you seek access to those records on MyHealthONE, we
need to make sure it is you. We will ask you for your name, email address, home
address, date of birth (which we may also use to make sure you are eligible to
use MyHealthONE in accordance with the MyHealthONE Terms of Use (the “Terms”)),
the answers to "secret questions" to which only you know the answers,
or other similar information. We may need to ask you for the information again
when you sign in from a new device.
We may also ask for information about your
location and medical needs to assist with finding a physician, and may collect
and pass on information to assist you in scheduling appointments, register for
classes and pre-register for procedures.
On the other hand, if you only want to use
MyHealthONE, for example, to look up educational health information, we may not
need to ask you any questions to make sure it is you.
We and our service providers may collect
Personal Information through mobile applications, including iOS and Android
apps (collectively, “Mobile Apps”), with your consent. In connection with your
use of the Services through such Mobile Apps, you may elect to provide us with
limited access to your device and the content stored on any such device
(“Mobile App Content”). For example, you may grant us access to your device’s
camera roll and/or photo library if uploading a profile image, photo ID, or
insurance cards. Mobile App Content shared by you will be used by us in support
of providing the Service to you. We make best efforts, in accordance with the
Mobile App developer policies and guidelines applicable to each mobile app
platform operator, to obtain your prior consent within the applicable Mobile
App in each instance; otherwise, this Privacy Policy serves as a general notice
with regards to such practices. Any such Mobile App Content will be used in
accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Web Server Logs
When you access or use our Services, we may
track information to administer our Services and analyze its usage. Examples of
information we may track include, without limitation:
Your Internet protocol
     address;
The kind of browser or
     computer you use;
Number of links you click
     within our Services;
State or country from
     which you accessed our Services;
Date and time of your
     visit;
Name of your Internet
     service provider;
Third party websites you
     linked to from our Services; and
Pages or information you
     viewed on our Services.
We use this information to analyze and
improve our Services, monitor traffic and usage patterns for information
security purposes and to help make our Services more useful.
Cookies and Web Beacons
A “cookie” is a small text file that may be
transferred to your device’s file system in order to personalize our Services
for you and to collect aggregate information regarding usage of our Services by
all of our users. Each device is assigned a different cookie that contains a
random, unique number. Our services use cookies and similar technologies to
collect data during the user experience, including demographic data. This
technology can persist anywhere from six months to two years.
When using the web version (as opposed to the
app version), your browser software can be set to warn you of cookies or reject
all cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to
reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies,
this may disable some of the functionality of our Services and you may not be
able to use certain features offered by MyHealthONE.
In addition to cookies, our Services may use
similar technologies for similar purposes. A “web beacon,” “clear GIF,” “web
bug,” or “pixel tag” is a tiny graphic file with a unique identifier that is
similar in function to a cookie, but would allow us to count the number of
users that have visited certain pages or screens of our Services, and to help
determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used
in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and
when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on
your device’s file system, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on
pages or screens.
We use Google Analytics and Firebase on our
Services to help us analyze the traffic and user activity on our Services,
which may include the use of mobile device identifiers provided by applicable
Apple or Google services (unless a user opts out of interest-based advertising
or ads personalization) or similar technologies that are used to collect data.
For more information on Google Analytics and Firebase’s processing of Personal
Information, please see
Google’s
Privacy and Terms
and
Google
Analytics For Firebase
. Consult with the mobile
device manufacturer and/or operating system developer documentation for
information regarding data collection (including opting out of or limiting such
practices). By using a
browser
plugin
provided by Google, you can opt out of
Google Analytics for the web. We reserve the right to share aggregated site
statistics monitored by cookies and web beacons with our affiliates and partner
companies.
We may display content from third party
platforms or services that allow you to view their hosted content directly from
the pages of our Site, and interact with them. For example, we use YouTube, a
video sharing and social media platform provided by Google LLC, to embed video
content on our Site.
Google’s
Privacy Policy
explains how YouTube/Google
treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you provide your
personal data in connection with your access and use of their services.
Some features on our Services (such as video
widgets on the MyHealthONE website used for demonstrations) may use cookies or
other methods to gather information regarding your use of MyHealthONE, and may
combine the information in these cookies with any Personal Information about
you that they may have. The use of such information by a third party depends on
the privacy policy of that third party.
We treat the information of everyone who
comes to our Services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We do not honor
Do Not Track (DNT) requests. To determine whether any of our third party
service providers (see the How We Disclose Personal Information section below)
honor DNT requests, please read their respective privacy policies.
Control of Cookies

default. However, you can remove or reject cookies in your browser’s settings.

GPS data; latitude and longitude) concerning the location from which you access
the Services, but we collect information on your region or postal code to help
us gather information useful for improving the relevance of our content and
securing our Services.
Third Party Advertising
We may allow third party advertising
companies to serve ads when you access or use our Services. These companies use
non-personally identifiable information regarding your access and use of our
Services and other websites, such as the pages viewed, date and time of your
visit, and number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address,
or other personal information), to serve ads to you on our Services and other
websites that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving
advertisements to our Services, our third party advertiser may place or
recognize a unique cookie on your browser. In addition, we or other third party
advertisers, may use web beacons to help manage our online advertising. This
allows us or a third party advertiser to learn which banner ads bring users to
our Services.
We use Google Ads, the Google Marketing
Platform and related marketing and advertising services provided by Google, LLC
in connection with our Site and general corporate advertising and marketing
operations for purposes of, among other things, online advertising, which
includes remarketing, re-engagement, or similar audience and advertising and
marketing features. You can control the information Google uses to show you ads
by changing your

interest-based advertising through
an applicable opt-out mechanism
specified by Twitter.
We use Facebook Ads and related services

Information Collected or Accessed
through the Portal
As a Service to its customers, we may also
provide Portals to offer some customers secure, private access to their own
records at our facilities, as well as certain internet-based services which may
include, among other things, assistance in finding a doctor, assistance in
scheduling appointments, the ability to register for classes and pre-register
for procedures, the ability to make payment for medical services rendered, and
access to health and patient education materials and secure messaging
(“Portal”). This may include the ability to access, collect, use, and/or share
personal or sensitive data related to, or in support of, public health
emergencies, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in connection
with your medical records and/or treatment at our facilities. For example, the
Service may allow you the ability to access, use, and/or share your proof of
vaccination status, current infection, or history of infection.
The Portal can provide you with access to
some of your medical records. When you seek access to those records on the
Portal, we need to confirm your identity, so we ask you for information such as
your name and email or physical address and other information such as your date
of birth (which we may also use to make sure you are eligible to use the Portal
in accordance with the Terms) and the answers to “secret questions” to which
only you know the answers. This information may be used to help administer your
user account and in managing your account. We may need to ask you for the
information again when you sign in from a new device.
We may ask for information about your
location and medical needs to assist with finding a physician, and may collect
and pass on information (which may include, where relevant, health information
such as your patient history) to assist you in scheduling appointments,
pre-registering for procedures, and registering for classes.

information outlined above, Personal Information about you may be used:

How We Disclose Personal Information
We do not sell, lease, rent or otherwise
disclose the Personal Information collected from our Services (including
contact, health or billing information) to third parties other than as provided
below, unless we obtain your consent.
We may disclose Personal Information:
To MyHealthONE Service
     Providers.
We transfer Personal Information to
     third party service providers to perform tasks on our behalf and to assist
     us in providing our Services. For example, we may use third party service
     providers for security, website analytics, and payment processing. We use
     commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third
     party service providers and partners that post a privacy policy governing
     their processing of Personal Information, and require our service
     providers to maintain confidentiality and comply with applicable laws in
     the processing of Personal Information. Review our list of our current
     third party service providers in the Appendix below.
To Authorized
     Representatives
. If another individual is managing your
     account on your behalf (for example, a mother managing the account of her
     son), as authorized by you or as a personal representative under
     applicable law, that person can view your information in MyHealthONE, as
     limited by applicable law or the Terms.
Healthcare Providers
.
     Your healthcare providers may have access to Personal Information for
     administrative and healthcare services. We may also use Personal
     Information to respond to and fulfill your requests.
To Partners
.
     We may share information with marketing, treatment or health care
     operations support partners required to protect the confidentiality of
     your information that will enable them to send you targeted messages or
     serve you targeted advertising, with your authorization or otherwise in
     compliance with HIPAA (defined below) and other applicable laws.
In the Event of Merger,
     Sale, Divestiture or Change of Control.
We
     may transfer or assign Personal Information to a third party entity that
     acquires or is merged with us as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or
     other change of control.
Other Disclosures.
We may disclose Personal Information about you if we have a good faith
     belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably
     necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal
     process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms, including
     investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or
     otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against harm
     to our or third parties’ rights, property or safety.
Third-Party Websites and Payments
If you follow a link from our Services to
another website, you may decide to disclose Personal Information at that
website. In contacting that site, or in providing information on that site,
that third party may obtain Personal Information about you. This Privacy Policy
does not apply when you leave MyHealthONE and its related Services and go to a
third party website. We encourage you to be aware when you leave MyHealthONE
and to read the privacy statements of each third party website that collects
Personal Information.
Any payments you may make for services you
have found on MyHealthONE (such as enrolling in a class) are made exclusively
through a third party website the separate privacy policy of which applies, and
not through the MyHealthONE. We are not responsible for any fees, charges, or
actions provided by such third party website.
Information Security
No website can guarantee security, but we
maintain industry accepted physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to
protect Personal Information collected via our Services in compliance with
applicable law. Please see the MyHealthONE Terms for more specific information
about information security and your responsibilities.
What can I do to protect my
Privacy?
Where you use a Portal or other Service that
is secured with a username and password, you are also responsible for taking
steps to protect the privacy of Personal Information about you. In order to
protect your privacy, you should:
Never share you sign in
     name or password;
Always sign out when you
     are finished using MyHealthONE;
Use only secure web
     browsers;
Employ common anti-virus
     and anti-malware tools on your system to keep it safe;
Use a strong password
     with a combination of letters and numbers;
Change your password
     often; and
Notify us
immediately if you believe your login and/or password have been
     compromised.
If you share your MyHealthONE user name and
password with another person, this will allow that person to see your
confidential medical record information and other Personal Information. We have
no responsibility concerning any breach of Personal Information due to your
sharing or losing your user name or password.
Retention of Information
We will retain Personal Information for the
period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it has been collected as
described in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required
by law, for security, fraud & abuse prevention, to comply with legal or
regulatory requirements, to ensure continuity of services or financial
record-keeping purposes.
Where practical, we dispose of certain
categories of information, including Personal Information, on a regular
schedule.
What if I am accessing
MyHealthONE from outside of the United States?
If you are visiting our Portal from outside
the United States, your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored or processed
in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is
operated. Although the data protection and other laws of the United States and
other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take
steps to protect your privacy, including, for transfers of Personal Information
from the European Economic Area, the use of contractual clauses (known as
“Model Clauses” or “Standard Contractual Clauses”) that have been approved by
the European Commission. By using our Services, you understand and agree that
your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties
with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.

Retention of Categories of Personal
Information
We will retain Personal Information for the
period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it has been collected.  In
accordance with internal record retention policies, we dispose of all
categories of Personal Information no later than 5 years from the date of
collection unless a longer retention period is required by law, for security,
fraud & abuse prevention, to comply with legal or regulatory requirements,
to ensure continuity of services or financial record-keeping purposes. Consumer
accounts in MyHealthOne are only deleted at the request of the Consumer and may
exceed the five-year retention period. Information collected from a “Contact Us”
webform may exceed the five-year retention period as it is a general
communication form that sits on most websites to give website visitors the
opportunity to ask general questions about the facility, its services or to
leave comments. Employees can find the relevant record series codes in the
Retention Schedules under Human Resources (HUM), which can be found in the
applicable Workforce Notices posted internally, or by making a privacy rights
request by following the instructions in this Privacy Policy.

the Authorized Agent’s authority to act on the Consumer’s behalf. In addition
to the opt-out link above, an Authorized Agent may exercise a Consumer’s
opt-out right through a technology indicating the Consumer's intent to opt out
such as a web link indicating a preference or browser setting, browser
extension, or global device setting.

Consumer making the request is the Consumer about whom we have collected the
Personal Data. In order to verify your identity we will, whenever feasible,
match the identifying information you provide to the Personal Data we already
maintain and/or use a third-party identity verification service.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

Improving performance
, such as maintaining and improving the performance of our Digital Properties;
Analytics

Security
, such as preventing fraud and malicious behavior.
Information collected
These tracking technologies collect data about you and your device, such as your IP address, location (both approximate and precise) cookie ID, device ID, Ad ID, operating system, browser used, browser history, search history, and information about how you interact with our Digital Properties (such as pages on our Digital Properties that you have viewed).

Your choices

http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
and
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
. We adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may also click on the AboutAds icon on a Company advertisement and follow the instructions on how to opt out.
