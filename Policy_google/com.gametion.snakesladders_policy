                            Ltd to show
                            an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a
                            segment of
                            that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and
                            you
                            respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you

                            characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.

                            and usage Information we collect is securely stored within our databases. However, it should
                            be noted
                            that as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable, thus we
                            cannot
                            guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you
                            supply us with

                            within our site, Gametion Global Technologies Pte Ltd Games, Mobile Apps or SNS Apps. In
                            addition, our advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target

                            third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called “clear gifs”
                            or “beacons”) to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to
                            recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located,

Gametion Global Technologies Pte Ltd does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information
                            to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Gametion
                            Global Technologies Pte Ltd to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics
                            (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24
                            who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the
                            third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the
                            audience that they are trying to reach.
Security
We use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as
                            encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information, so the

                            databases. However, it should be noted that as effective as encryption technology is, no
                            security system is impenetrable, thus we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor
                            can we guarantee that the information you supply us with won't be intercepted while being
                            transmitted to us over the Internet or wireless communication, and that any information you
                            transmit to Gametion you do at your own risk. If you have any questions about the security
