Data Retention period for your Account Data
Data Retention Policy
We retain your account information — including your full name, email address, affiliated company name, and any data you have directly imported into our mobile app — for as long as you have an active subscription with us.
If your subscription expires but you maintain an active account with us, we will retain your account information for an additional two years after the subscription's expiration.
Once your account is deleted, it will no longer be visible within the app and we will delete your personal data from our systems immediately, except in the following circumstances:
Legal Compliance: If applicable laws require us to retain certain information (e.g., for tax and accounting purposes in cases where purchases were made within the app).
Regulatory Obligations: If retention is necessary to demonstrate our compliance with legal requirements (e.g., if an account has been blocked, we may retain related records as evidence in case of disputes or legal inquiries).
Pending Issues: If there are unresolved matters such as claims, disputes, or legal proceedings that require us to retain the relevant information until they are settled.
Legitimate Business Interests: Data retention is necessary to prevent fraud, enhance user security, or maintain platform integrity (e.g., to prevent a previously banned user from creating a new account due to safety concerns).
After these periods, any retained data will be securely deleted in accordance with our data protection policies.
