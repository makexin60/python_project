Introduction
This Privacy Notice provides an overview of the processing of your personal data in the context of the use of the offers and online Services on our Website and the corresponding App (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Service’).
Furthermore, this Privacy Notice informs you about your rights and the possibilities you have to control your personal data and to protect your privacy.
We have always taken the protection of your personal data very seriously and continuously take appropriate organisational, contractual and technical measures to protect your data from unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.
1. Details of the Controller
The data controller is Ideawise Limited, Room 604, Alliance Building, 133 Connaught Road, Central Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Its representative is SmH ServiceCenter.de GmbH, Metzer Str. 13, 13595 Berlin (Germany). Please direct any general support requests to: support@fet-app.com).
Ideawise Limited is also meant when the terms ‘we’ or ‘us’ are used below. Please note that we are a company based outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’). As far as you use our Service and data is processed, these data are collected by a data controller located in a so-called ‘Third Country’. Nonetheless, we will respect standards under applicable European data protection laws. Details about international data transfers can be found in section 7 below. You can contact our data protection officer at: dataprotection@fet-app.com (general support request will not be processed by the data protection team, please direct these requests to: support@fet-app.com).
2. Information on the Types of Data Processed and Their Origin
If we provide the Service for your use, we process personal data from various sources. This is data that we collect automatically - for example when you visit our Website - as well as other data that you have additionally provided to us.
a. Types of Data That We Automatically Collect
When visiting our Website or opening our App, you submit technical information to our servers. This happens regardless of whether you subsequently register an account with us to use the Service or not. In any case, the following data will be processed:
During every visit of our Website:
The so-called server log. This is a file which stores the following data: the time, the status of your Website visit (status means in this case whether the request of the Website was successful or not) as well as the request that your browser has made to the server to open the page, the amount of data transferred and the Website from which you came to the requested page (referrer), and the product and version information of the browser used (user agent).
When opening the App:
IP address
The identification number, name and version number of the App, as well as App Store origin
Device model, OS Type, Name and Version number (iOS / Android)
Device Language
We also use cookies and API tokens to process this data. Cookies are usually small text files that download to your device and that store the above information about you when you use our Services. API tokens are unique identifier files that we use for authentication when requesting access to our Service. If you want to learn more about how cookies and API tokens work, what cookies and API tokens we use, and where you can find opt-out options, click
here
If you create a profile on our Service, we will assign a so-called unique user ID to it. Besides your chosen profile name, the unchangeable Unique User ID allows us to uniquely identify your profile.
b. Types of Data You Transmit to Us
In addition to the data we receive from all Website visitors, we also process other data from registered users.
The exact amount of this data depends on how you use the Service.
Personal information that you publicly upload to your profile or other areas of the Service will be visible to other users (and searchable via the search feature within the Service). If you choose additional settings for the wider publication of your data, this information will also be accessible to users who are not logged in. These privacy settings can be determined by you in your profile settings.
The data you provide to us include:
i. User account / profile data:
To use the Service, you can create a user account (a ‘Profile’). When you create a Profile, you must provide some mandatory information to complete the registration.
Required are:
Username
Password
Email address
Gender
Country
City and postcode
Date of birth
What gender is searched for
What you are looking for (kinky dates, networking...)
When uploading an image, other users have the option of sending the image directly from our Service to Google Image Search using the ‘Classify Images’ feature. This way, other users can help us to better recognise fake profiles and unwarrantedly uploaded images. Of course this does not apply where you have uploaded an image to your secret gallery.
By use of the so-called Single-Sign-On procedure, when opening the ‘BDSM Training School’, a profile is also automatically created at Thinkific. More information about this in Section viii.
ii. Optional Profile Information:
The use of the Service is possible only with the aforementioned information. However, you may also provide additional personal information in your Profile, such as physical characteristics, personal interests or detailed information about your sexual preferences, political opinion or ideological beliefs. If you want to, you can upload photos and videos to your Profile or to a secret gallery. The scope of this optional data can be determined by you via the respective input fields in your Profile settings.
iii. Location Data:
When you register with our Service, we use your IP once to determine your approximate location. You can agree to this localisation when registering or change it if necessary. In the app your location will only be collected with your permission.
iv. Communication Data: Users
If you communicate with other users of our Service, we save your conversations so that the conversation history with your chat partners can be permanently displayed, and conduct checks on certain keywords for the prevention of criminal activity.
v. Communication Data: Customer Service
When you contact our Customer Service, written communications between you and the Service staff and notes on each transaction are stored so that you can always have a smooth Customer Service experience when the transaction is resumed by other Service staff.
vi. Data for Age Verification and Fake Check:
To perform the age verification (18+ check), we need a video from you. You must be visible in the video. In addition, your date of birth must be clearly visible on an official identity card. This way, we can verify that you are in fact of age.
Alternatively, (Germany only), with 'Age Verification via PIN', €0.99 will be deducted from your bank account and your age checked and verified by Schufa. Upon entering the unique PIN code from your bank statement on your profile, you are age-verified.
To verify your profile, you need to upload an image that shows your face and your left or right hand.
vii. Notification of Device Access (App):
If you grant the App access to your camera or photo album, we will only receive the data you actively provide, e.g. photos you upload to the Services and nothing beyond. The same applies to you consenting to the delivery of notifications and the way in which they are displayed. You can change these settings at any time in the device settings and revoke your consent there. Your list of contacts will never be accessed at any time.
viii. Social and Single Sign-On:
You can also use the ‘Login with Facebook’ feature to create your profile. When choosing this feature, you transmit your username on the social network at www.facebook.com (‘Facebook’), your email address with which you registered on Facebook, as well as your gender, first name and your profile picture. Your first name and profile picture are used to suggest a profile name and profile picture in our Service, you can reject or change both during the sign-up process.
Please be aware: When opening the ‘BDSM Training School’, a strictly designated account will be created with our service provider Thinkific so that you may use our ‘BDSM Training School’ feature. More information about Thinkific can be found in Section 4.
3. Processing Purposes & Legal Bases
We process your data exclusively for the following defined purposes:
To allow you and other users to use the Service and to ensure its functionality
To provide you with additional Services that you have purchased
To keep you up to date with relevant information about our Service and to send you system notifications to the email address you have provided
To send our newsletter and other information about our Services to the provided email address (such as for example about competitions/sweepstakes, discount campaigns, events, satisfaction surveys or other similar offerings of our online platforms)
To adapt the provision of the Service to your needs
To provide the ‘BDSM Training School’ together with Thinkific
To display advertising tailored to your interests (including participation in sweepstakes)
To continuously improve the Service offer and to correct errors
To detect and prevent fraud attempts
To ensure the protection of minors
To enable the exchange with Customer Service in case of questions
To check information published on your profile or shared by you through the Service
To disclose your personal data to third parties if we are legally obliged to do so
To assert legal claims and to defend against legal disputes
To ensure IT security and smooth operation of IT systems
To assist the competent authorities in discovering and prosecuting criminal offences including, but not limited to, offences causing bodily injury or death of the victims
In doing so, we rely on various legal bases in accordance with the so-called General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union legal framework for the standardisation of data protection law (‘GDPR’ for short). We refer in detail to the following legal bases:
Your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. a & Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR)
When visiting the Website without registration, you agree to the cookie guidelines in the pop-up. If you have given us your consent to process personal data for specific purposes, this consent ensures the legality of the processing. By registering and creating your profile, you expressly agree to its use for the purposes described in detail in this Privacy Notice by ticking the box before submitting the registration form. So, if we process your data, it is because you have expressly allowed us to do so when you registered. Your consent is therefore the most important legal basis for the processing of your personal data by us. If you provide us with information about your sexual orientation or preferences, we will process this data exclusively on the basis of your consent.
Fulfilment of contractual obligations (Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR)
At the same time, the processing of personal data takes place also for the provision of the Service and in the context of the performance of our contract with you. In many cases, the processing is not only justified by your consent, but also because it is necessary to fulfil our contract with you: In order to fulfil your claim to the Services described in more detail in our General Terms and Conditions, it may be necessary, for example, to process your personal data, for example, if you wish to pay for your VIP or Premium membership the processing of your payment information is required.
Protecting vital interests (Art. 6 (1) lit. d GDPR)
We invoke this legal basis in narrowly defined case constellations (e.g. reported suicide announcements) where the processing is necessary for the protection of the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.
Safeguarding legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR)
By registering to use the Service, you consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this Privacy Notice. That is why we process your data in principle, because you have allowed us to do so. However, there are some cases in which we would be entitled to process your data without your consent because it is necessary to protect our legitimate interests (or the interests of third parties). In this respect, the purposes for which we process your data also represent legitimate interests. We pursue legitimate interests, for example, if we check images or texts for content relevant under applicable criminal law or if we take measures to secure our ‘virtual domiciliary rights. In these cases, we will not ask you in advance whether you agree to this processing, since processing is otherwise permitted by law.
Legal requirements or in the public interest (Art. 6 (1) lit. c & e GDPR)
In addition, we are legally obliged to provide certain information to criminal prosecution, tax or other authorities in individual cases upon request, if such processing is necessary for safeguarding public interest. Additionally, commercial and tax law contain such obligations for processing in some cases.
4. Data Transmission
We treat your personal data with care and confidentiality and will only pass them on to third parties and other recipients to the extent described below and not beyond.
a. To Other Users:
As our Service is a platform for getting to know each other, it is in the nature of things that we forward your profile data as well as other data (e.g. messages you send and other communication you have with other users and the community) at your request and on your behalf to the corresponding users of the Service.
b. To Group Companies:
We transfer data to affiliated companies which form part of the same group of companies as us within the framework of strict protection requirements. This is the case, for example, when you make a Customer Service request. We will then forward this request to SmH ServiceCenter.de GmbH, a service company associated with us. In addition, our development company, TheNetCircle Network Co. Ltd. as well as the payment / debt collection partners Compay GmbH and Faircollect GmbH and the community management and marketing at Playamedia S.L. receive the necessary information to ensure the security and functionality of the Service and the handling of payments.
c. Third parties and Other Recipients (Both When Using Web and App):
In addition, we transmit data to external service providers who enable us to provide the Service to you. These include hosting providers, delivery service providers, payment service providers and providers of analytics platforms. We require each of these service providers to comply with strict rules about the security of your personal information when processing personal information on our behalf. Such processing operations are therefore principally based on your explicit consent as well as contractual agreements guaranteeing an adequate level of protection for your data.
d. Third parties (only when using the App):

For such an analysis Adjust uses your anonymised IDFA (iOS) or GAID (Android) as well as your anonymised IP address. It is not possible to identify you individually.
Apple
We use Apple (location USA) and its Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) to send push notifications to iOS users that may contain personally identifiable information.
Facebook SDK
The Facebook SDK (location USA) included in our App helps us to increase the success of Facebook advertising campaigns by, for example, avoiding the display of ads on devices on which this App is already installed. In addition, the Facebook SDK allows for various evaluations of the installation of the App and of the success of the advertising campaign. In addition, individual activities (events) of the user within the App can be analysed in order to better define the target group for advertising campaigns, for example. For this purpose, we send Facebook pseudonymous data, such as the time, model name of the device, IP address, name of the App, a unique Ad-ID created by Facebook, and the information that the App has been launched. The Advertising ID provided by the operating system of the terminal device serves as the pseudonym. The latter occurs regardless of whether the user uses Facebook or not.

Stripe
. For more details, please see Section 4. If you want to use paid offers via the App, you will provide further additional information depending on the chosen payment method. However, you will not transfer this information to us, but will transfer it directly to the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store after you have given your consent to the respective terms and conditions and privacy policy. Such purchases are made directly through the relevant store.
6. Information on Behavioural Advertising
‘Behavioral advertising’ means the use of tracking measures to determine the potential interest of users in advertisements on our Website and in our App and to display them according to their interests. For this we use the following features: Gender, membership type, 18+ status, preferences, interest in membership, number of logins and which gender a member is looking for. Members with a Premium and VIP membership have the possibility to turn off advertising.
7. Transmission to Countries Outside the EU or the EEA
All servers of the Service are located in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’), so your data do not leave the EEA from a technical perspective, instead the technical provision and processing of the data for the operation of the Service takes place in the EEA.
However, when you submit information to us, it is legally collected by a data controller located in a country outside the EEA because we are based in Hong Kong (P.R. China). In addition, our development company is also based in China, from where it has technical access to the servers in the EEA in certain situations.
According to the GDPR, there are special requirements for transfers of data to so-called ‘Third Countries’ not guaranteeing an adequate level of data protection, without applicable adequacy decisions and without specific guarantees to compensate for this deficit. This means that, from a European perspective, personal data and data subjects enjoy less protection and rights there.
Where no adequate level of protection for personal data can be guaranteed in a specific country, this means that it is possible that government bodies such as criminal prosecution services and intelligence agencies might be able to access data under less strict requirements than within the territory of the EEA (including secret disclosures without any pre-notification to you). Further, it is likely that you will have no effective remedy to challenge such access to your personal data in or out of court. While you might find this acceptable, we strongly urge you to cautiously assess the level of protection you deem appropriate for the personal data we process when providing the Service to you.
If, as a data controller, we transfer data to a third country, we generally guarantee an adequate level of data protection. This applies regardless of whether it is a transfer to an affiliated company or to another recipient (such as an external service provider acting as a data processor). In these cases, we will ensure that the transfer is either based on approved standard contractual clauses (as well as the prerequisite additional safeguards required under the Articles 44 and following of the GDPR), that there is an adequacy decision for the respective country, or that other appropriate safeguards such as binding corporate rules have been provided to guarantee an adequate level of data protection.
However, please be reminded: When justifying the transfer of personal data to third countries we, first and foremost, rely on the informed explicit consent you have freely given to us when signing up for our Service (as per Article 49 (1) lit. a GDPR). Specifically, you consent to the transfer of the data mentioned in this Privacy Statement to the US, the UK as well as China. If you would like to suspend the third-country transfer of your personal data, you are free to not sign up for our Service or to close the account you have opened with us.
8. How Long Will my Data be Stored?
We process and store your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the fulfilment of our contractual or legal obligations. Thus, we store the data in principle only as long as our contractual relationship with you exists and also after termination only as far as the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of China require this. If the data are no longer necessary for the fulfilment of such obligations, they shall be deleted regularly and without delay, unless their further processing is necessary for the protection of legitimate interests or for the preservation of evidence within the framework of statutes of limitations. In this sense, in particular the storage of age and profile verification photos and videos is carried out expressly for the entire duration of the contract, since we hold this data in particular for the ongoing guarantee of the protection of minors and the prevention of fraud attempts.
The data collected under 2.a are stored for 90 days. This storage period serves our protection against attacks on the systems of our Service, e.g. by so-called Distributed Denial of Service attacks, in which the systems are deliberately overloaded by a large number of accesses to our Service in order to interrupt the provision of our Service.
9. Information on the Voluntary Nature of the Information Provided
You are not legally obliged to provide us with the above data. In principle, the contractual relationship that you have entered into with us by agreeing to our General Terms and Conditions does not result in any obligation to provide this personal data. However, the transmission of the compulsory data is a basic requirement for a conclusion of a contract with us. In addition, if you do not provide us with certain information or if you object to its use, you may not be able to use the Service, or only to a limited extent. This is because the Service essentially only becomes ‘alive’ through the content posted by the users.
10. Information About Your Rights
You can assert the following rights:
Your right to information according to article 15 GDPR,
Your right to rectification according to article 16 GDPR,
Your right to erasure according to article 17 GDPR,
Your right to restriction of processing according to Article 18 GDPR as well as
Your right to data portability according to Article 20 GDPR.
If you have any questions in this regard, please contact customer service at support@fet-app.com.
You can revoke your consent to the processing of personal data at any time.
In addition, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the responsible data protection supervisory authority.
11. Information About Your Right of Objection
a. Right of Objection in Individual Cases
In addition to the rights already mentioned, you have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of personal data relating to you on the basis of Article 6 (1) lit. e GDPR (‘public interest grounds’) or of Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR (‘legitimate interests’). If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can prove compelling reasons for processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims
b. Right to Object to the Processing of Data for Advertising Purposes
You also have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data.
Please also note the information in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy: If we terminate the processing due to your objection, it may be that the Service can no longer be made available to you or only to a limited extent. The objection can be made in each case form-free and should be addressed to support@fet-app.com if possible.
12. Information on Your Legal Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
Please note: We do not sell personal data. This means we will not transmit data to any third party except for the recipients mentioned in this Privacy Statement, for the stated purposes. The relevant recipients have agreed to contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of personal data.
California law grants state residents certain rights, including the rights to access specific types of personal data, to learn how we process personal data, to request deletion of personal data, and not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights. If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and have registered for an account with us, you may also ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to our Services.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.

.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:

When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the

When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.

When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe

Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie).

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center

During the process, you’d be asked to share with us certain Personal Data (like your government ID and selfie for biometric verification, Personal Data you input, or Personal Data that is apparent from the physical payment method like a credit card image). To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.

Financial services
. Certain Business Users leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via Stripe or our Financial Partners. For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User. In addition to any Transaction Data we may generate or receive when these cards are used for purchases, we also collect and use your Personal Data to provide and manage these products, including assisting our Business Users in preventing misuse of the cards. Please review the privacy policies of the Business User and, if applicable, our bank partners associated with the financial service (the brands of which may be shown on the card) for more information.
Identity/Verification services

In some instances, we may also collect information about you directly from you, or from our Business Users, Financial Partners, and other third parties for the same purposes. Furthermore, to protect our Services, we may receive details such as IP addresses and other identifying data about potential security threats from third parties.

Additionally, we might use technology to evaluate the potential risk of fraud associated with individuals seeking to procure our Business Services or arising from attempted transactions by an End Customer or End User with our Business Users or Financial Partners.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
. We use Personal Data to meet our contractual and legal obligations related to anti-money laundering, Know-Your-Customer ("KYC") laws, anti-terrorism activities, safeguarding vulnerable customers, export control, and prohibition of doing business with restricted persons or in certain business fields, among other legal obligations. For example, we may monitor transaction patterns and other online signals and use those insights to identify fraud, money laundering, and other harmful activity that could affect Stripe, our Financial Partners, End Users, Business Users and others.

c. Sharing of Personal Data.
Besides the sharing of Personal Data described above, we share Personal Data in the ways listed below:
Stripe Affiliates

We authorize these service providers to use or disclose the Personal Data we make available to them to perform services on our behalf and to comply with relevant legal obligations.

Corporate Transactions
. If we enter or intend to enter a transaction that modifies the structure of our business, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, change of control, or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets, or stock, we may share Personal Data with third parties in connection with such transaction. Any other entity that buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your Personal Data, subject to the terms of this Policy.
Compliance and Harm Prevention
. We share Personal Data when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable law; to abide by rules imposed by Financial Partners in connection with the use of their payment method; to enforce our contractual rights; to secure and protect the Services, rights, privacy, safety, and property of Stripe, you, and others, including against malicious or fraudulent activity; and to respond to valid legal requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include authorities outside your country of residence.
