We may also retain financial information for legal purposes, including compliance with the United States Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, in the event of an actual or threatened legal claim, we may retain your information for purposes of establishing, defending against, or exercising your or our rights with respect to such claim.
By providing information directly to us, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States, and potentially to other countries outside of the EEA. You understand that the current laws of countries outside of the EEA may not provide the same level of protection as the data protection laws of the EEA. Nonetheless, we will take all reasonable steps to protect your privacy in accordance with the applicable data protection laws.
You are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide any personal information to us.
Data Security
We will take reasonable steps to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We also use reasonable efforts to ensure that our Sites are generally available to access information concerning our privacy practices. However, there will be occasions when access to the Sites will be interrupted or unavailable. We will use reasonable efforts to minimize such disruption where it is within our reasonable control. You agree that DreamLoop Technologies Private Limited shall not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Sites.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the App like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the App.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through our App. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.
