IV.
International Transfers
We may transfer your personal information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy to a jurisdiction that is not the one from which we collected such information, including the United States and United Kingdom (“UK”). We have procedures in place to ensure that such transfers of information are conducted using appropriate safeguards and in compliance with applicable laws.
If you reside in Europe, the UK, or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (“KSA”):
We rely on certain service providers who are located out of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the UK, and the KSA, which may result in the transfer of your personal information outside of these jurisdictions.
For transfers from the EEA/UK: Where the recipient is located in a country whose legislation has not been recognized by the European Commission or the UK as having an adequate level of protection, we ensure that the transfer is governed by the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses or the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, as applicable. In this regard, please note that we will provide you with a copy of applicable safeguards upon request, at the contact details specified at the end of this Privacy Policy.
For transfers from KSA: Where the recipient is located in a country that has not been recognized by the KSA authorities as having an adequate level of protection, we ensure that such transfers are governed by appropriate safeguards as set out in the KSA’s Personal Data Protection Law, its Implementing Regulation, and the Regulation on Personal Data Transfer Outside the Kingdom.
V.	Personal Information We Sell, Share, or Use for Targeted Advertising
We may use your information for targeted advertising, or “sell” or “share” the personal information, as defined under applicable laws, as follows:

Google Privacy Policy for Partners
). You may accept or reject optional cookies by visiting the
Cookie Settings Center
.

.
With Users’ prior consent, we receive personal information that may be considered sensitive under certain privacy laws, such as geo-location information and biometric information.

Additionally, if we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When you do so, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdrew consent.
To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information below.
We will maintain procedures to verify that you are authorized to make the requests set forth above. You may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf by providing your written permission and verifying your identity, though we will need to verify that such agent has the authority to act on your behalf.
We will timely acknowledge your request, and either provide a substantive response or notify you of an extension period and the reason for the extension. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to appeal our decision if we deny your request to exercise any of the above rights. You can do so by replying directly to our denial or emailing

Please note that in order for you to assert these rights, we may need to verify your identity to confirm your right to access your personal information. This is a security measure to ensure your personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
