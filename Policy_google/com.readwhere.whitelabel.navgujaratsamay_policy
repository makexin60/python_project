This Privacy Policy applies to ngs.press (hereinafter, “us”, “we”, or “ngs.press”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, NavGujarat Samay collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. NavGujarat Samay’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how NavGujarat Samay’s visitors use its website. From time to time, NavGujarat Samay may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
NavGujarat Samay also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://ngs.press blog posts. NavGujarat Samay only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to NavGujarat Samay’s websites choose to interact with NavGujarat Samay in ways that require NavGujarat Samay to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that NavGujarat Samay gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://ngs.press to provide a username and email address.
Security
