A web beacon is a clear or transparent picture file used to keep track of users' navigation through a web site or various web sites. Web beacons are normally used by web sites that use third party traffic monitoring and tracking services. In our case we use Google Analytics, amongst others. Our Sites, whether directly or indirectly, use web beacons in order to enhance the functionalities of our Sites and to gather information on traffic data, analytics etc. and to better understand our users and their use of our Sites and to enable us to purposefully process such content.
Third Party Vendors/ Marketing Agents
We engage third party vendors/marketing agents (including Google LLC ("Google")) for online advertising, marketing and/or remarketing service providers for purposes of remarketing, interest-based advertising, age, gender, demographic or location targeting, etc. to better target and serve more relevant ads to our intended audience based on available data. Third-party vendors/marketing agents, including Google, may show our advertisements on websites across the Internet. For more information as to how Google uses data when you use our Sites/Applications please refer to:
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
(as may be amended by Google from time to time).
For Sites, as part of our advertising and marketing activities, data analysis, and other activities, we have implemented or may implement an open-source web analytics tool from InnoCraft Limited (“Matomo”), as well as Google's Display Advertising features such as Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, Google Enhanced Conversions, Google Signals, Google Customer Match, and/or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads at:
https://www.google.com/settings/ads
We and our third-party vendors/marketing agents (including but not limited to Google) use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on a user's past visits to our website. (Please refer to the section on Web Analytics/ Statistics / Google Enhanced Conversions / Google Signals / Google Customer Match / TikTok Pixel / Matomo below for more information.)
We may also work with the following third party vendors (subject to change from time to time and may be done without prior notice):
Awin/The Affiliate Gateway/ ClixGalore/ FlexOffers/ TradeDoubler
These are networks where we (as advertisers) provide the ads of products that we want to promote, and publishers (e.g. coupon sites, blogs etc) can choose to promote our products by publishing our ads on their websites. The publishers earn a commission for every sale that occurs through their website. A tracking code is placed on our site to collect order information such as transaction ID, purchased product, order quantity, order amount, click date, and order date. This information is needed to validate orders and ensure that the commission amount paid to publishers is correct.
Personally Identifiable Information
We do not allow or use or associate personally identifiable information with remarketing lists, cookies, data feeds, or other anonymous identifiers nor associate targeting information (such as demographics or location, with any personally identifiable information collected from the ad or its landing page, or share any personally identifiable information with Google through our remarketing tag or any product data feeds which might be associated with our ads, or send Google precise location information) without first obtaining your consent.
When we or our third party vendor/marketing agents create a remarketing list, we do not use any sensitive information about our customers or visitors to our Sites, whether directly collected or associated with a visitor, based on the visitor's profile or behavior on our Sites or apps.
Restrictions on list creation may apply to both individual web pages and entire web sites or apps
Ad content may not imply knowledge of personally identifiable or sensitive information
Interest-Based Advertising
As an advertiser using interest-based advertising, as far as we are aware, we do not:
Use interest-based advertising or implement the remarketing tag on any Site or app directed at children under 13 or which stores or solicits age information from people under the age of 13
Create a remarketing list or create ad content that specifically seeks to reach people in ways that are prohibited
Create ad content which implies knowledge of personally identifiable or sensitive information about the Site or app visitor, even when the remarketing list has been created without using such information
Include products which fall into sensitive categories, such as pharmaceutical products, in any data feeds
For the avoidance of doubt, ads that are already prohibited by Google's
AdWords content policies
, are not used in our campaigns.
Web Analytics/ Statistics / Google Enhanced Conversions / Google Signals / Google Customer Match / TikTok Pixel / Matomo
Our Sites use a web analytics service provided by Google called Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses "cookies" (as described above), as well as data from our advertising programs including interest-based and demographics-based advertising, to help better analyse how our users use our Sites. The information stored in the cookie about your use of the Sites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States or anywhere else as may be determined by Google. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Sites, compiling reports on web site activity and providing other services relating to activities on our Sites and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By entering into and using this web site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Creative and Google in the manner and for the purposes set out hereinabove.
You may access Google Analytics' currently available opt-out options at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/
We may disclose certain or all of the information that we collect, as stated herein and in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not reveal personally identifiable information about you to third-parties for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize (or are deemed to do so under applicable law); (2) in connection with our Sites as described above; (3) the information is provided to comply with applicable laws, regulations, search warrants, subpoenas or court orders, enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) the information is to address emergencies or acts of God or to address disputes or claims, or to persons holding a legal or beneficial interest. We may also gather aggregated data about our customers and Site visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated data (but not personally identifiable information) to our partners, service providers, advertisers and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.
More information on Google tools (subject to change from time to time and may be done without prior notice):
Google Tag Manager
Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a script/tag management service which we use to manage our various third party tracking codes, including that of Google Analytics. Using this tool, we can install/uninstall scripts and tags into our web sites without having to directly modify its source code.
AdWords
Google AdWords is an advertising platform which allows advertisers to use different types of ads to reach their target customers. Ways that we can target customers:
Bidding on keywords that customers use to search in search engines.
Targeting by customer interests and demographics.
Re-targeting visitors who have previously visited Creative's website.
Please note that customer interests/demographics are collected/profiled by Google, not advertisers. Google will present these options in the AdWords platform for advertisers to select for advertising.
Additional information such as product id and order value may be collected by us when visitors visit our website so that we can retarget them (by showing them the product ads of the pages which they previously visited) through AdWords.
Our Sites may also use
Google's Enhanced Conversion
service which allows us to more accurately measure online conversions of our advertisements. This requires that we send any of the following personal data to Google:
Names,
Email addresses,
Phone numbers,
Addresses,
Client identifiers,
Online identifiers, including internet protocol addresses.
The data is used to match our customers to Google accounts, to generate reports on online conversions driven by Google ad interactions. Google will keep the data confidential and secure using the same standards that they use to protect their own users' data. Such data is stored in an encrypted format to protect against unauthorized access. More information on how Google uses Enhanced conversion data can be found at
https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9755941?hl=en
We may also use the
Google Signals
service. Google Signals are session data from sites and apps that Google associates with users who have signed in to their Google accounts, and who have turned on Ads Personalization. This allows Google to associate your session data (such as user activity or how you interact with our Sites) if you have signed into your Google account with Ads Personalization turned on. This association of data with these signed-in users is used to enable cross-device remarketing, and cross-device key events export to Google Ads.
The purpose of this is to allow us to develop a holistic view of how those users interact with an online property from multiple browsers and multiple devices. For example, we can see how users browse products on our Sites from a phone, and later return to complete purchases from a tablet or laptop. In addition, Google Signals helps us with remarketing, advertising reporting, and demographics and interests.
Using Google Signals, we do not need to collect additional data from users since Google is the party receiving the relevant information. Instead, Google Analytics will collect information about demographics and interests from devices and from users who are signed in to their Google accounts and who have turned on Ads Personalization. Other information that Google Analytics may collect include user location, search history, YouTube history and data from sites that partner with Google.
You can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features you use, including through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer opt-out) as follows:
Through ad settings:
https://myadcenter.google.com/home?ref=privacy-policy
https://adssettings.google.com/partnerads
Through advertising ID (for mobile apps)
https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
We may use
Google Customer Match
services, where we use the personal data that we have already collected (such as customers' names, their respective email addresses, what they have bought, and so on) to advertise/reach/re-engage with such customers via Google Ads. Google will be able to connect, i.e. match, the data that we provide to the appropriate Google account of such customers. This enables us to deliver certain Creative advertisements to such customers.
We typically create an electronic file with the personal data properly formatted, and upload it to Google Ads for processing. This allows us to target customers who have previously bought our products (based on the information contained in such electronic files), and notify them of related products that might interest them.
In addition, we may also share personal data provided by customers on our Sites (when they make a purchase on our Sites) with Google Analytics, and have Google Analytics share the data with Google Ads.
Google's will transform the personal data received from Creative into hashed codes using the secure hashing algorithm SHA256, a one-way hashing mechanism, to protect such data. Google will (i) only use the customer data files for building Customer Match audiences and to ensure compliance with Google's policies, (ii) not share the customer data files with other Google teams or with any third party, and (iii) not retain the customer data files for any longer than necessary to create Customer Match audiences for Creative. For more information on how Google uses Customer Match data, see
https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6334160?hl=en&ref_topic=6296507
.
Tracking code provided by Google is placed on our websites to track various metrics.
We also make use of the following site(s) to collect site visitor information (subject to change from time to time and may be done without prior notice):
TikTok
Creative may also use
TikTok Pixel
as an analytical tool.
The TikTok Pixel consists of JavaScript code that allows us to understand, track and analyse visitor activity on our website (see
https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-pixel?lang=en
). The TikTok Pixel collects personal information such as emails and mobile phone numbers.
Any TikTok Pixels that we use will be embedded in our website. The applicable advertisements on our website will be linked to the TikTok Pixel that has been embedded in our website to track your online movements on our website from when you click on the advertisement until you make a purchase on, or exit, our website.
Please note that any data collected through the TikTok pixel will be processed by TikTok in accordance with TikTok's privacy practices (please refer to TikTok's privacy policy (
https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy
) and TikTok Advertiser Tools (
https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-advertiser-tools-and-related-terms?lang=en
)). By continuing to use our website, you consent to the use of the TikTok pixel for the purposes mentioned above.
Creative may also use an open-source web analytics tool from Matomo. It is a cookie-less, web analytics software whose purpose is to track user activity on our Sites without the use of third-party cookies, machine learning or gap filling. No personal data is collected. Instead, website behaviour data is collected to enable us to analyse the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and page design. For more details, see
https://matomo.org/feature-overview/
.
CrazyEgg
This is used to collect site user interaction data anonymously to optimize user experience for site navigation.
Site visitors are tracked and their site interaction data is collected and processed to understand general usage behavior of all our users. No personal identifiable information is transmitted nor can the transmitted data be reversed to re-identify the individuals.
We may disclose certain or all of the information (described above) that we collect, as stated above and in accordance with the terms set forth in this section. We do not reveal personally identifiable information about you to third-parties for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize; (2) in connection with our Sites as described above; (3) the information is provided to comply with applicable laws, regulations, search warrants, subpoenas or court orders, enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) the information is to address emergencies or acts of God or to address disputes or claims, or to persons holding a legal or beneficial interest. We may also gather aggregated data about our customers and Site visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated data (but not personally identifiable information) to our partners, service providers, advertisers and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.
Social Media Sites
Our Sites interface with social media sites which may include Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. In the event that you do decide to "like" or share information from our Sites through these services, you must also review the privacy policy of each of the linked social media sites accordingly. If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect your site visit to your personally identifiable information.
We may from time-to-time partner or enter into arrangements with another party or other parties to provide specific benefits and/or services to our customers including sending more streamlined and targeted promotions or ads etc. to enhance your overall user experience. We will provide to such partners the information that we believe is reasonably necessary for them to provide such benefits and/or services to you. In the event that you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, please do let us know (in writing) of your preference to not be contacted by sending us a letter or e-mailing our offices at the contact information below informing us of your preference.
We make use of the following social media sites (subject to change from time to time and may be done without prior notice):
Facebook
Used to keep our customers informed on the latest happenings and product offerings from Creative.
Facebook provides general, non-personal, non-identifiable data in their insights tool. While we do not collect any personal data, emails from our database (such as newsletter subscribers) may be uploaded into the Facebook Custom Audience tool to match Facebook users with our subscribers who have already interacted with our brand, and Facebook Lookalike Audience which identifies new users who share similar characteristics with our existing customers. From time to time, we may run advertising campaigns to target these matched users and may also include Facebook tracking pixels on our websites for conversion and re-marketing purposes.
Twitter
Engage and interact with the community via tweets or direct messages.
We do not collect any personal information of our users via Twitter. Occasionally, emails from our database (such as newsletter subscribers) will be uploaded to the Twitter Ad Tool for ads targeting. Tracking pixels are also uploaded onto our website to track ads conversions and to facilitate re-marketing. Twitter Insights Tool also provides us with non-personal, non-identifiable data like gender, age and location.

We may from time to time, provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, surveys or referral programs on our Site.

We will store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Retention of Personal Information
We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. The duration for which we retain your information depends on the purpose(s) for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with any applicable laws or regulations.

Cookies may collect information like client ID, timestamps, your preference in settings, and content of a shopping card, but they do not collect any personal information. Please note that in some circumstances, dynamic IP addresses (which changes every time a person connects to a network) may result in personal identifiable information being created if they are combined with other information. Cookies enable us to customize your experience and provide greater convenience at our Sites.

A web beacon is a clear or transparent picture file used to keep track of users' navigation through a web site or various web sites. Web beacons are normally used by web sites that use third party traffic monitoring and tracking services. In our case we use Google Analytics, amongst others. Our Sites, whether directly or indirectly, use web beacons in order to enhance the functionalities of our Sites and to gather information on traffic data, analytics etc. and to better understand our users and their use of our Sites and to enable us to purposefully process such content.
Third Party Vendors/ Marketing Agents
We engage third party vendors/marketing agents (including Google LLC ("Google")) for online advertising, marketing and/or remarketing service providers for purposes of remarketing, interest-based advertising, age, gender, demographic or location targeting, etc. to better target and serve more relevant ads to our intended audience based on available data. Third-party vendors/marketing agents, including Google, may show our advertisements on websites across the Internet. For more information as to how Google uses data when you use our Sites/Applications please refer to:
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
(as may be amended by Google from time to time).
For Sites, as part of our advertising and marketing activities, data analysis, and other activities, we have implemented or may implement an open-source web analytics tool from InnoCraft Limited (“Matomo”), as well as Google's Display Advertising features such as Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, Google Enhanced Conversions, Google Signals, Google Customer Match, and/or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads at:
https://www.google.com/settings/ads
We and our third-party vendors/marketing agents (including but not limited to Google) use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on a user's past visits to our website. (Please refer to the section on Web Analytics/ Statistics / Google Enhanced Conversions / Google Signals / Google Customer Match / TikTok Pixel / Matomo below for more information.)
We may also work with the following third party vendors (subject to change from time to time and may be done without prior notice):
Awin/The Affiliate Gateway/ ClixGalore/ FlexOffers/ TradeDoubler
These are networks where we (as advertisers) provide the ads of products that we want to promote, and publishers (e.g. coupon sites, blogs etc) can choose to promote our products by publishing our ads on their websites. The publishers earn a commission for every sale that occurs through their website. A tracking code is placed on our site to collect order information such as transaction ID, purchased product, order quantity, order amount, click date, and order date. This information is needed to validate orders and ensure that the commission amount paid to publishers is correct.
Personally Identifiable Information
We do not allow or use or associate personally identifiable information with remarketing lists, cookies, data feeds, or other anonymous identifiers nor associate targeting information (such as demographics or location, with any personally identifiable information collected from the ad or its landing page, or share any personally identifiable information with Google through our remarketing tag or any product data feeds which might be associated with our ads, or send Google precise location information) without first obtaining your consent.
When we or our third party vendor/marketing agents create a remarketing list, we do not use any sensitive information about our customers or visitors to our Sites, whether directly collected or associated with a visitor, based on the visitor's profile or behavior on our Sites or apps.
Restrictions on list creation may apply to both individual web pages and entire web sites or apps
Ad content may not imply knowledge of personally identifiable or sensitive information
Interest-Based Advertising
As an advertiser using interest-based advertising, as far as we are aware, we do not:
Use interest-based advertising or implement the remarketing tag on any Site or app directed at children under 13 or which stores or solicits age information from people under the age of 13
Create a remarketing list or create ad content that specifically seeks to reach people in ways that are prohibited
Create ad content which implies knowledge of personally identifiable or sensitive information about the Site or app visitor, even when the remarketing list has been created without using such information
Include products which fall into sensitive categories, such as pharmaceutical products, in any data feeds
For the avoidance of doubt, ads that are already prohibited by Google's
AdWords content policies
, are not used in our campaigns.
Web Analytics/ Statistics / Google Enhanced Conversions / Google Signals / Google Customer Match / TikTok Pixel / Matomo
Our Sites use a web analytics service provided by Google called Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses "cookies" (as described above), as well as data from our advertising programs including interest-based and demographics-based advertising, to help better analyse how our users use our Sites. The information stored in the cookie about your use of the Sites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States or anywhere else as may be determined by Google. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Sites, compiling reports on web site activity and providing other services relating to activities on our Sites and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By entering into and using this web site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Creative and Google in the manner and for the purposes set out hereinabove.
You may access Google Analytics' currently available opt-out options at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/
We may disclose certain or all of the information that we collect, as stated herein and in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not reveal personally identifiable information about you to third-parties for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize (or are deemed to do so under applicable law); (2) in connection with our Sites as described above; (3) the information is provided to comply with applicable laws, regulations, search warrants, subpoenas or court orders, enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) the information is to address emergencies or acts of God or to address disputes or claims, or to persons holding a legal or beneficial interest. We may also gather aggregated data about our customers and Site visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated data (but not personally identifiable information) to our partners, service providers, advertisers and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.
More information on Google tools (subject to change from time to time and may be done without prior notice):
Google Tag Manager
Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a script/tag management service which we use to manage our various third party tracking codes, including that of Google Analytics. Using this tool, we can install/uninstall scripts and tags into our web sites without having to directly modify its source code.
AdWords
Google AdWords is an advertising platform which allows advertisers to use different types of ads to reach their target customers. Ways that we can target customers:
Bidding on keywords that customers use to search in search engines.
Targeting by customer interests and demographics.
Re-targeting visitors who have previously visited Creative's website.
Please note that customer interests/demographics are collected/profiled by Google, not advertisers. Google will present these options in the AdWords platform for advertisers to select for advertising.
Additional information such as product id and order value may be collected by us when visitors visit our website so that we can retarget them (by showing them the product ads of the pages which they previously visited) through AdWords.
Our Sites may also use
Google's Enhanced Conversion
service which allows us to more accurately measure online conversions of our advertisements. This requires that we send any of the following personal data to Google:
Names,
Email addresses,
Phone numbers,
Addresses,
Client identifiers,
Online identifiers, including internet protocol addresses.
The data is used to match our customers to Google accounts, to generate reports on online conversions driven by Google ad interactions. Google will keep the data confidential and secure using the same standards that they use to protect their own users' data. Such data is stored in an encrypted format to protect against unauthorized access. More information on how Google uses Enhanced conversion data can be found at
https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9755941?hl=en
We may also use the
Google Signals
service. Google Signals are session data from sites and apps that Google associates with users who have signed in to their Google accounts, and who have turned on Ads Personalization. This allows Google to associate your session data (such as user activity or how you interact with our Sites) if you have signed into your Google account with Ads Personalization turned on. This association of data with these signed-in users is used to enable cross-device remarketing, and cross-device key events export to Google Ads.
The purpose of this is to allow us to develop a holistic view of how those users interact with an online property from multiple browsers and multiple devices. For example, we can see how users browse products on our Sites from a phone, and later return to complete purchases from a tablet or laptop. In addition, Google Signals helps us with remarketing, advertising reporting, and demographics and interests.
Using Google Signals, we do not need to collect additional data from users since Google is the party receiving the relevant information. Instead, Google Analytics will collect information about demographics and interests from devices and from users who are signed in to their Google accounts and who have turned on Ads Personalization. Other information that Google Analytics may collect include user location, search history, YouTube history and data from sites that partner with Google.
You can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features you use, including through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer opt-out) as follows:
Through ad settings:
https://myadcenter.google.com/home?ref=privacy-policy
https://adssettings.google.com/partnerads
Through advertising ID (for mobile apps)
https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
We may use
Google Customer Match
services, where we use the personal data that we have already collected (such as customers' names, their respective email addresses, what they have bought, and so on) to advertise/reach/re-engage with such customers via Google Ads. Google will be able to connect, i.e. match, the data that we provide to the appropriate Google account of such customers. This enables us to deliver certain Creative advertisements to such customers.
We typically create an electronic file with the personal data properly formatted, and upload it to Google Ads for processing. This allows us to target customers who have previously bought our products (based on the information contained in such electronic files), and notify them of related products that might interest them.
In addition, we may also share personal data provided by customers on our Sites (when they make a purchase on our Sites) with Google Analytics, and have Google Analytics share the data with Google Ads.
Google's will transform the personal data received from Creative into hashed codes using the secure hashing algorithm SHA256, a one-way hashing mechanism, to protect such data. Google will (i) only use the customer data files for building Customer Match audiences and to ensure compliance with Google's policies, (ii) not share the customer data files with other Google teams or with any third party, and (iii) not retain the customer data files for any longer than necessary to create Customer Match audiences for Creative. For more information on how Google uses Customer Match data, see
https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6334160?hl=en&ref_topic=6296507
.
Tracking code provided by Google is placed on our websites to track various metrics.
We also make use of the following site(s) to collect site visitor information (subject to change from time to time and may be done without prior notice):
TikTok
Creative may also use
TikTok Pixel
as an analytical tool.
The TikTok Pixel consists of JavaScript code that allows us to understand, track and analyse visitor activity on our website (see
https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-pixel?lang=en
). The TikTok Pixel collects personal information such as emails and mobile phone numbers.
Any TikTok Pixels that we use will be embedded in our website. The applicable advertisements on our website will be linked to the TikTok Pixel that has been embedded in our website to track your online movements on our website from when you click on the advertisement until you make a purchase on, or exit, our website.
Please note that any data collected through the TikTok pixel will be processed by TikTok in accordance with TikTok's privacy practices (please refer to TikTok's privacy policy (
https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy
) and TikTok Advertiser Tools (
https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-advertiser-tools-and-related-terms?lang=en
)). By continuing to use our website, you consent to the use of the TikTok pixel for the purposes mentioned above.
Creative may also use an open-source web analytics tool from Matomo. It is a cookie-less, web analytics software whose purpose is to track user activity on our Sites without the use of third-party cookies, machine learning or gap filling. No personal data is collected. Instead, website behaviour data is collected to enable us to analyse the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and page design. For more details, see
https://matomo.org/feature-overview/
.
CrazyEgg
This is used to collect site user interaction data anonymously to optimize user experience for site navigation.
Site visitors are tracked and their site interaction data is collected and processed to understand general usage behavior of all our users. No personal identifiable information is transmitted nor can the transmitted data be reversed to re-identify the individuals.
We may disclose certain or all of the information (described above) that we collect, as stated above and in accordance with the terms set forth in this section. We do not reveal personally identifiable information about you to third-parties for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize; (2) in connection with our Sites as described above; (3) the information is provided to comply with applicable laws, regulations, search warrants, subpoenas or court orders, enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) the information is to address emergencies or acts of God or to address disputes or claims, or to persons holding a legal or beneficial interest. We may also gather aggregated data about our customers and Site visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated data (but not personally identifiable information) to our partners, service providers, advertisers and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.
Social Media Sites
Our Sites interface with social media sites which may include Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. In the event that you do decide to "like" or share information from our Sites through these services, you must also review the privacy policy of each of the linked social media sites accordingly. If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect your site visit to your personally identifiable information.
We may from time-to-time partner or enter into arrangements with another party or other parties to provide specific benefits and/or services to our customers including sending more streamlined and targeted promotions or ads etc. to enhance your overall user experience. We will provide to such partners the information that we believe is reasonably necessary for them to provide such benefits and/or services to you. In the event that you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, please do let us know (in writing) of your preference to not be contacted by sending us a letter or e-mailing our offices at the contact information below informing us of your preference.
We make use of the following social media sites (subject to change from time to time and may be done without prior notice):
Facebook
Used to keep our customers informed on the latest happenings and product offerings from Creative.
Facebook provides general, non-personal, non-identifiable data in their insights tool. While we do not collect any personal data, emails from our database (such as newsletter subscribers) may be uploaded into the Facebook Custom Audience tool to match Facebook users with our subscribers who have already interacted with our brand, and Facebook Lookalike Audience which identifies new users who share similar characteristics with our existing customers. From time to time, we may run advertising campaigns to target these matched users and may also include Facebook tracking pixels on our websites for conversion and re-marketing purposes.
Twitter
Engage and interact with the community via tweets or direct messages.
We do not collect any personal information of our users via Twitter. Occasionally, emails from our database (such as newsletter subscribers) will be uploaded to the Twitter Ad Tool for ads targeting. Tracking pixels are also uploaded onto our website to track ads conversions and to facilitate re-marketing. Twitter Insights Tool also provides us with non-personal, non-identifiable data like gender, age and location.
Instagram
This is used to reach out to various demographics through imagery and video stories. No personal data are collected but Instagram provides non-personal, non-identifiable data in its insight tool which includes gender, age and location.
YouTube
This is used to provide branding, informational and product demo videos regarding our products. While we do not collect individual user information, YouTube provides non-personal, non-identifiable data in the channel insights tool. Some examples of data include gender, age and location.
Surveys, Contests or Referral Programs
We may from time to time, provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, surveys or referral programs on our Site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys, contests or referral programs is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information may include contact information (such as name, e-mail address and shipping address) and demographic/geographic information.
We use this information to notify contest winners, award prizes, record store credits, monitor Site traffic or personalize the Site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), and/or send participants email newsletters (as applicable).
We may use third-party service providers to conduct these surveys and/or contests and/or referral programs; if so, that company will be generally prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest, survey or referral program with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and have your consent.
Tell-A-Friend
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Sites, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. We will store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Retention of Personal Information
We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. The duration for which we retain your information depends on the purpose(s) for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with any applicable laws or regulations.
Our Global Operations
As Creative operates globally, we may need to share your personal information with our worldwide business units and/or business partners. We may share your information with other Creative entities (including subsidiaries and affiliates) and/or local or foreign business partners who are acting on our behalf to provide the necessary service for you or information requested by you, for data storage, to simplify the management of customer information and as referred to herein where necessary, for transaction processing and/or for fraud prevention. Such Creative entities and/or business partners are governed by our Privacy Policy with respect to the use of this data and are bound by appropriate confidentiality and/or data processing agreements.
In summary, in order for us to serve you better, we may use your personal information for the following purposes, including but not limited to:
The Creative Store
To process your order, we will ask you for your personal information such as: name, e-mail address, delivery address, telephone number and credit card information.

Google Product Privacy Guide
How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

What Information We Collect
” to certain entities in our Corporate Group (as described
here
