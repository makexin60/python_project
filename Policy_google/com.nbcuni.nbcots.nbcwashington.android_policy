California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  Such residents may also opt out of the sharing or processing of their personal information for targeted advertising.
We provide third parties such as advertisers and advertising networks (including social media networks) information including identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; hashed identifiers [contact information], geolocation information, such as city; and inference data in order to enable marketing to you and delivery of targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites.  Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables NBCUniversal to provide you certain content for free and provide relevant offers to you.  The disclosure of such personal information listed above to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under applicable law and is sharing of personal information and the processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of NBCUniversal’s use or disclosure of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so in the footer or settings menu of the brand with which you engage by selecting “Your Privacy Choices” link.
You may still receive advertising, including personalized ads based on NBCUniversal data on the Services. On some of our websites and applications when you click the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the website footer or in the application settings menu, you will be shown a tool that allows you to opt out of the online “sales” and sharing/processing of personal information for targeted ads on the website and application.  Please note, if you use different browsers, devices, or services you will need to make your elections separately. In some cases, you may also be presented with form field to complete, in those cases we ask for your email address or other information so we may add it to an appropriate suppression list.

Please note, if we do not detect that you are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire Oregon, Texas, Utah or Virginia, the opt out of sale or sharing/processing for targeted advertising data choices will not apply even if you take the actions described above.
Please note that if you have a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent required by applicable law.

Third-Party Online Services
NBCUniversal Services may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) of third party platforms or contain links to third party services. These other platforms (such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, and set top boxes) and sites (even if co-branded as NBCUniversal) may collect information about you and use this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms of service. We do not control those third parties’ policies or practices. Where NBCUniversal collects personal information on a co-branded website or service, we will provide a link to our privacy policy as appropriate. In some circumstances, NBCUniversal may host some websites on behalf of others and those entities may place or permit the placement of cookies and other tracking technology. NBCUniversal is not responsible for these tracking practices.
We maintain organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect the information we collect and use. These safeguards vary depending upon a variety of factors including the sensitivity of the information we collect and use. Despite all reasonable practices, no security method is infallible.
We will keep your information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests.  The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes.  If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.
We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. The retention period that applies to your information may vary depending on the NBCUniversal Services you use and how you interact with them. Some NBCUniversal Services may provide additional details on their data retention practices, so we encourage you to consult their website and/or FAQs.

NBCUniversal Services may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) of third party platforms or contain links to third party services. These other platforms (such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, and set top boxes) and sites (even if co-branded as NBCUniversal) may collect information about you and use this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms of service. We do not control those third parties’ policies or practices. Where NBCUniversal collects personal information on a co-branded website or service, we will provide a link to our privacy policy as appropriate. In some circumstances, NBCUniversal may host some websites on behalf of others and those entities may place or permit the placement of cookies and other tracking technology. NBCUniversal is not responsible for these tracking practices.
We maintain organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect the information we collect and use. These safeguards vary depending upon a variety of factors including the sensitivity of the information we collect and use. Despite all reasonable practices, no security method is infallible.
We will keep your information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests.  The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes.  If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.
We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. The retention period that applies to your information may vary depending on the NBCUniversal Services you use and how you interact with them. Some NBCUniversal Services may provide additional details on their data retention practices, so we encourage you to consult their website and/or FAQs. In addition, in the event you have an account that holds credits, point balances or other entitlements, we may continue to hold the account to allow you to obtain the benefit in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions.
NBCUniversal is a global company and has its headquarters in the United States. We may transfer your information to Related Companies, service providers, and other third parties located outside of your country of residence, including in the United States. This is necessary to provide our Services and for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.  Data privacy laws vary from country to country and may not be equivalent to, or as protective as, the laws in your home country.  We take steps to ensure that reasonable safeguards are in place with aim to ensure an appropriate level of protection for your information, in accordance with applicable law. These measures include data transfer agreements. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use.
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes to our practices or the law. We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the NBCUniversal Services.  Please check the NBCUniversal Services periodically for updates.
The date at the top of the Privacy Policy tells you when it was last updated. If we make material changes to the way we collect or use your information, you will be provided with appropriate notice, including by, but not limited to, posting the updated Privacy Policy on this website, and providing notice in accordance with legal requirements. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when the revised Privacy Policy is posted.  By continuing to use the NBCUniversal Services following any changes to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge you have read and understand the updated Privacy Policy, and you understand that we will collect, use, and share information as stated therein.

“Privacy Choices”: Do Not Sell or Share or Process My Personal Information for Targeted Advertising (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia Residents only)
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  Such residents may also opt out of the sharing or processing of their personal information for targeted advertising.
We provide third parties such as advertisers and advertising networks (including social media networks) information including identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; hashed identifiers [contact information], geolocation information, such as city; and inference data in order to enable marketing to you and delivery of targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites.  Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables NBCUniversal to provide you certain content for free and provide relevant offers to you.  The disclosure of such personal information listed above to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under applicable law and is sharing of personal information and the processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of NBCUniversal’s use or disclosure of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so in the footer or settings menu of the brand with which you engage by selecting “Your Privacy Choices” link.
You may still receive advertising, including personalized ads based on NBCUniversal data on the Services. On some of our websites and applications when you click the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the website footer or in the application settings menu, you will be shown a tool that allows you to opt out of the online “sales” and sharing/processing of personal information for targeted ads on the website and application.  Please note, if you use different browsers, devices, or services you will need to make your elections separately. In some cases, you may also be presented with form field to complete, in those cases we ask for your email address or other information so we may add it to an appropriate suppression list. In other cases, you will be directed to this page where we provide additional information and options for you to learn more about your choices and how to opt out from interest-based advertising more broadly.
Please note, if we do not detect that you are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire Oregon, Texas, Utah or Virginia, the opt out of sale or sharing/processing for targeted advertising data choices will not apply even if you take the actions described above.
Please note that if you have a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent required by applicable law.
Sensitive Data
We may use certain sensitive personal information as allowable by law for purposes including analytics and to enable marketing to you and the delivery of targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites, such displaying an ad relevant to your precise location data.

Incentive Programs (California Residents Only)
The Services may offer opportunities to receive certain services or benefits such as discounts or free or extended services (such as bonus streaming time or additional videos), which may require the provision of personal information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable law (each, an “Incentive Program”).
When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program (e.g., by opting out of emails or terminating a streaming service). To the extent we can determine the value of your information, we consider the value of providing you with a more personalized experience as well as the expenses we incur in providing Incentive Programs that are reasonably related to the costs associated with offering the Incentives.

We and our service providers, advertisers, and other third parties use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., HTTP cookies, HTML 5, flash local storage cookies, web beacons, GIFs, embedded scripts, ETags/cache browsers, hashed identifiers and software development kits) to recognize you on, off, and across NBCUniversal Services and your devices. For more information about the use of cookies and similar technologies on the NBCUniversal Services (including your opt-out choices) please see our
Cookie Notice

Mobile App and Connected Devices
Depending on the device you use, you may be able to manage your advertising and location preferences through your device settings and as outlined in our
Cookie Notice

We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to manage personalized in-application advertisements.

Third-Party Online Services
NBCUniversal Services may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) of third party platforms or contain links to third party services. These other platforms (such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, and set top boxes) and sites (even if co-branded as NBCUniversal) may collect information about you and use this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms of service. We do not control those third parties’ policies or practices. Where NBCUniversal collects personal information on a co-branded website or service, we will provide a link to our privacy policy as appropriate. In some circumstances, NBCUniversal may host some websites on behalf of others and those entities may place or permit the placement of cookies and other tracking technology. NBCUniversal is not responsible for these tracking practices.
We maintain organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect the information we collect and use. These safeguards vary depending upon a variety of factors including the sensitivity of the information we collect and use. Despite all reasonable practices, no security method is infallible.
We will keep your information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests.  The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes.  If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.
We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. The retention period that applies to your information may vary depending on the NBCUniversal Services you use and how you interact with them. Some NBCUniversal Services may provide additional details on their data retention practices, so we encourage you to consult their website and/or FAQs. In addition, in the event you have an account that holds credits, point balances or other entitlements, we may continue to hold the account to allow you to obtain the benefit in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions.
NBCUniversal is a global company and has its headquarters in the United States. We may transfer your information to Related Companies, service providers, and other third parties located outside of your country of residence, including in the United States. This is necessary to provide our Services and for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.  Data privacy laws vary from country to country and may not be equivalent to, or as protective as, the laws in your home country.  We take steps to ensure that reasonable safeguards are in place with aim to ensure an appropriate level of protection for your information, in accordance with applicable law. These measures include data transfer agreements. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use.
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes to our practices or the law. We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the NBCUniversal Services.  Please check the NBCUniversal Services periodically for updates.
The date at the top of the Privacy Policy tells you when it was last updated. If we make material changes to the way we collect or use your information, you will be provided with appropriate notice, including by, but not limited to, posting the updated Privacy Policy on this website, and providing notice in accordance with legal requirements. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when the revised Privacy Policy is posted.  By continuing to use the NBCUniversal Services following any changes to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge you have read and understand the updated Privacy Policy, and you understand that we will collect, use, and share information as stated therein.

We may then pass your device ID along to an advertising network in order to serve you advertisements about scary movies.
Partners. For example, you may ask us to share your information with an airline or hotel in order to book a flight as part of a vacation package.

Search Engines. For example, if you post a picture of a drawing you made on one of our websites, that drawing may then be available via search engines since the website is publicly available.

Cookie Notice

Does NBCUniversal Sell or Share or Process my Personal Information for Targeted Advertising?
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. Such residents may also opt out of the sharing or processing of their personal information for targeted advertising.
We provide third parties such as advertisers and advertising networks (including social media networks) information including identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; hashed identifiers [contact information], geolocation information, such as city; and inference data in order to enable marketing to you and delivery of targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites.  Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables NBCUniversal to provide you certain content for free and provide relevant offers to you.  The disclosure of such personal information listed above to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under applicable law and is sharing of personal information and the processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
If you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of NBCUniversal’s use or disclosure of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so in the footer or settings menu of the brand with which you engage by selecting “Your Privacy Choices” link.
You may still receive advertising, including personalized ads based on NBCUniversal data on the Services.  On some of our websites and applications when you click the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the website footer or in the application settings menu, you will be shown a tool that allows you to opt out of the online “sales” and sharing/processing of personal information for targeted ads on the website and application.  Please note, if you use different browsers, devices, or services you will need to make your elections separately. In some cases, you may also be presented with form fields to complete, in those cases we ask for your email address or other information so we may add it to an appropriate suppression list. In other cases, you will be directed to this page where we provide additional information and options for you to learn more about your choices and how to opt out from interest-based advertising more broadly.
Please note, if we do not detect that you are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon, Texas, Utah or Virginia, the opt out of sell or sharing/processing for targeted advertising data choices will not apply even if you take the actions described above.
Please note that if you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent required by applicable law.
While NBCUniversal does not engage in the following activity, Nevada law requires us to post the following: certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “covered information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information.  “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.
If you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from NBCUniversal, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by filling out
this form
. We will maintain your request in the event our practices change.

Business contact information, such as your business email so that our sales or PR teams can get in touch (with your consent, if required).
Due diligence information, such as your background information, to ensure that we are legally allowed to do business with you.

To build and manage business relationships, for example, we may use your office address to send you an invitation for an event.
For compliance and risk management activities for business relationships, for example, gifts and business entertainment expense tracking.

If you use NBCUniversal applications on an Apple device, you may notice some changes both in the app store and in the consents available. In an effort to provide clarity, we have offered some additional information below.
How do the categories in the Apple menu compare with your Privacy Policy?
The Apple menu reflects categories of information collected through our Apple app while our Privacy Policy covers information collected through both Apple and non-Apple app products and services.
Apple provided pre-defined categories that cannot be changed or clarified within the app store. Our
Privacy Policy
provides a more detailed overview of the categories of data we collect with examples to help you understand more about our services.
There are some differences in Apple’s categories and the categories in our Privacy Policy. For example:
We use the category “transactional” to describe credit cards and other information that may be collected during a purchase as well as your purchase history and Apple uses the term “financial” to describe credit cards and “purchase history” to cover other information related to your purchase.
We use the term “connection and usage” to describe data collected from your browsing history, search term history, and other interactions with our applications (such as clicking on a news story) while Apple uses “browsing history”, “search history” and “usage data” respectively.
The Apple store says my information is linked. What does that mean?
Depending on the app you are using, we or our partners may link data collected on your application to your account, device, or identity for a variety of purposes. For example, we and our partners may link information in order to:
Personalize your experience by tailoring viewing and content recommendations to you;
Identifying you when you log-into our services so we can remember where you left off on a tv show you were viewing;
Customize advertising or marketing messaging; or
As otherwise described in our
Privacy Policy
.
The Apple store says my information is being used to track me. What does that mean?
Depending on the app you use, we may use information collected from that app (including user or device data) together with data collected from other apps, websites and properties we do not own to tailor advertising or content recommendations on our app, inform you of our products and services outside of the app, and measure those activities using third parties. This helps us to continue to provide you with the free high-quality content that you love to watch and read as well as offers that are more relevant to you.
If I do not consent to ‘tracking’ on an Apple device what happens?
Apple’s tracking consent restricts NBCUniversal from linking data collected from that App with third-party data for targeted advertising or advertising measurement. If you do not consent within a specific NBCUniversal Apple app, you may still receive tailored advertising or content recommendations from us, including targeted ads or recommendations based on the data that we collect from you directly elsewhere, including data collected across other NBCUniversal applications, websites and platforms. In addition, your choice does not affect the data collected prior to the launch of Apple’s Tracking Transparency framework. For more recently collected data, we will apply your most recent tracking choice to all the applicable data collected since the launch of the framework. For more information about your choices around data collection generally, please see
your rights
and
choices
.
If you use NBCUniversal applications on an Android device, you may notice some changes in the app store. In an effort to provide clarity, we have offered some additional information below.
How do the categories in the Android Data safety section compare with your Privacy Policy?
The Android Data safety section reflects categories of information collected through our Android app while our Privacy Policy covers information collected through both Android and non-Android app products and services.
Android provided pre-defined categories that cannot be changed or clarified within the app store. Our
Privacy Policy
provides a more detailed overview of the categories of data we collect with examples to help you understand more about our services.
There are some differences in Android’s categories and the categories in our Privacy Policy. For example:
We use the term “connection and usage” to describe data collected from your browsing history, search term history, and other interactions with our applications (such as clicking on a news story) while Android uses “app activity”, “web browsing” and “app info and performance” respectively.
We use the term “provide the NBCUniversal Services” and to describe functions like authenticating you or verifying your identity while Android uses “app functionality” and “account management”.
The Android Data safety section says my information is shared. What does that mean?
The Android store has a specific definition of sharing, which means transferring user data collected from the app to a third party. The Android store does not include as sharing transferring user data: (i) to a service provider that processes data on behalf of the app developer based on the developer’s instructions; (ii) for a specific legal purpose (iii) based on a specific user-initiated action. For more information on what Android considers sharing you can go to their support page
here
. NBCUniversal’s Privacy Policy
here
describes our sharing practices even those that do not fall under the Android store’s definition of share.
The Android Data safety section has a section focused on data deletion request mechanisms. Can you provide more information?
If, under local law, you have the right to delete your data you can learn more via our Privacy Policy
here
. Please note that some NBCUniversal Services can only be provided if we have your information, therefore deletion of your information will result in termination of such Services.

Introduction
Welcome to NBCUniversal!
This Guide is for kids.
NBCUniversal has lots of services. Most of our services are for users who are 18 years old and older. For some, you must be over the age of 12 to use them.
You should check with parent or guardian before you use our services.
If you are allowed to use our services, this guide explains the information we might collect about you and how we use it when you use NBCUniversal’s services in a way that is easier to read for kids. If you also want to learn even more, you (and your parent or guardian) can take a look at our main
Privacy Policy
. It may be a little harder to read, but there is more information in there.
There is also some information for parents and guardians regarding choices for kids’ information below, but our main Privacy Policy for parents and guardian or other adult users is
here
.
If you have any questions, you or your parent or guardian can contact us at
privacy@nbcuni.com

Policy – A set of rules or instructions that we follow
Guide - A helpful breakdown of those rules
Children or kids– People younger than 18 years old

Collect – What we gather
Account – Access to a service for you or your parent or guardian with a username and password
Consent – When someone says we are allowed to do something

For Children
Before using any of our services, you should check with your parent or guardian to make sure you are allowed to. If you are allowed to use the service, you or your parent or guardian might share information with us.  Most of the time, we do not have users we know are children.  If you just look at a website or use one of our services because your parent or guardian signed up, we usually do not know who you are or how old you are.
Depending on how old you are and what you are doing, we may know different things about you.
Expand All
What information could we have about you and how did we get it?
We need information about you to provide our services, and we may get this information from a few different places:
you or your parent or guardian
your phone, computer, or tablet. Sometimes we might get this information from technology called cookies.
We have more information on cookies and other tracking technologies
here
, but it is more complicated, so ask a trusted parent or guardian if you need help making choices about cookies
we might get information about you from others – like your family and friends
from other companies
Information we have from these different places might include:
Facts about you, like your name, email, address, phone number, or other information like that. But kids are not allowed to have accounts, and most of the time you are not allowed to give us this information
Things that you might enjoy, like sports, types of shows, characters, and games
Remember not to give us anything you do not think you should share or anything you do not want to share.
If we have information about you from different places, we might put it all together in one place unless we know you are a kid.

Sometimes your parent or guardian may be able to see how you use certain services (like what you watched) or ask for your information about how you use the services. This is to protect you and to keep you safe.
Depending on how old you are, you or your parent or guardian might have the ability to choose what we do with your information. You (or more likely your parent or guardian) can ask us:
