In May 2021, Google Play
announced the new Data safety
section
,
which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing,
and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in
regards to your usage of the Google Mobile Ads SDK. On this page, you can find
information on whether and how our SDK handles end-user data, including any
applicable settings or configurations you can control as the app developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app
developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google
Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection,
sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest version

(version
24.1.0
) of the
Google Mobile Ads SDK.
If you are using a prior version of the Google Mobile Ads SDK, consider
updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate.
The Google Mobile Ads SDK will continue to be updated over time. This page
reflects these changes, so make sure to check back and update your disclosures
as necessary.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's
guide about data
types
to help you
determine which
data
types
and
purposes
best describe the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also
account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
Data collected and shared automatically
The Google Mobile Ads SDK collects and shares the following data types
automatically
for

advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes.
Data
By default, the Google Mobile Ads SDK...
IP address
Collects device's IP address, which may be used to estimate the general
    location of a device.
User product interactions
Collects user product interactions and interaction information, including
    app launch, taps, and video views.
Diagnostic information
Collects information related to the performance of your app and the SDK,
    including
     
     crash logs,
     
     app launch time, hang rate, and energy usage.
Device and Account identifiers
Collects
Android
    advertising (ad) ID
,
app set ID
,
    and, if applicable, other identifiers related to signed-in accounts on the
    device.
All of the user data collected by Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in
transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
Data handling
Android ad ID collection is optional. The ad ID can be reset or deleted by users
using ad ID controls in the Android settings menu. As the app developer, you can
prevent the collection of ad IDs by
updating the app's manifest
file
.
Certain other features in the Google Mobile Ads SDK, such as the
Limited Ads
feature, may also disable transmission of the ad ID and other data.
Data collected and shared depending on your usage
If you are using any optional product features that involve additional data
(such as advance reporting) or participating in any tests of new product
features that involve additional data, be sure to check if those features or
tests require additional data disclosures.
