This includes aggregated data, as discussed further below.
Our role with respect to your personal data

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.
We reserve the right to update and change this notice at any time. If we make a material change to our privacy practices, we will update this notice and update the last updated date accordingly.

”), we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data, other than in relation to sensitive data, when we are using tracking technologies and sending third party direct marketing communications to you via e-mail or text message. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the contact information below or changing the settings on our cookie banner.
Health and Sensitive Information
As a user, as part of your profile, you may choose to enter health information into the Sites, like your height, weight or exercise data, or, in specific circumstances designed to protect the user, whether you are pregnant. If you choose to participate in a pregnancy-related survey or workout program, you may also provide sensitive information about your health and pregnancy.
Some of the Sites functionalities (
e.g.
free text fields) may allow a user to enter information the user wants to share with iFIT that could be of a sensitive nature. These free text fields may appear after completing workout reviews, submitting feedback on your experience of the Sites, or when completing customer surveys. Users may also choose to share potentially sensitive information when interacting with our support team.
iFIT may use or otherwise infer information about your health, including information about your medical conditions or requirements, as well as data on your physical characteristics from this information.
For users in jurisdictions that require it, iFIT requires explicit consent from users before they can add their health data (like height, weight and exercise data) into the Sites or otherwise submit sensitive information to iFIT. You may always withdraw your consent to the processing of your sensitive information.
You can withdraw your consent for the processing of health data you entered into the Sites at any time by contacting us using the contact information below. If you provided iFIT with consent to process any other sensitive information, or you're unsure about how to withdraw consent or about what information you did provide, please contact us using the contact information below. Withdrawing consent will not prohibit you from using the Sites, but please note some functionality across the Sites, like tracking weight loss progress, could be disabled or may not function properly.
Marketing
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. You can withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes at any time by changing the settings on our cookie banner.
Promotional offers from us
We may use your identity, contact, technical, usage, and profile data to form a view on what we think you may want or need or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you (known in the industry as marketing).
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us, have purchased goods or services from us, or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion, and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
Opting out
We market our products in a variety of ways. If you opt-in to receive marketing communications from us, we may send you information about new products, services or discounted offerings. You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you these types of marketing messages at any time by logging into the iFIT Products and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences, by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you, or by contacting us with a request at any time.
When you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product or service purchase, warranty registration, product or service experience, or other transactions.

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collect it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and, if required, explain our legal basis for and obtain your consent to the new use.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, when this is required or permitted by law.
5.

Internal third parties
Other companies in the iFIT group act as joint controllers or processors, provide IT and system administration services, and undertake leadership reporting. When we share information internally, we require our affiliates and subsidiaries to process your personal data consistent with this notice.
External third parties
Service providers acting as processors based inside or outside the US who provide IT and system administration services. We require all service providers to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes, and we only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
Type of data: All categories of data listed in Section 2, only as necessary for the service being provided.
Partners that offer health and fitness services only when you choose to link your account.

Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them.

6.
International transfers
We share your personal data within the iFIT group. We store the information we collect—including your personal data—in the United States, so if you are accessing an iFIT site from another country, your information is being transferred to and from the United States and specifically outside of the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”) or Brazil.
We ensure that your personal data is protected by requiring all of iFIT's companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. Moreover, sensitive and private data exchanged between an iFIT site and you occurs over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.
We want you to feel confident using the iFIT Products. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal data, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal data and should avoid sending personal data through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website
www.consumer.ftc.gov
for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
Note if you are located in the EU
: Whenever we transfer your personal data, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using an approved data transfer mechanism, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (“
SCCs
”) approved by the European Commission, which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Note if you are located in Brazil
: Some of these third parties may be located outside of Brazil. In some cases, the Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (“
ANPD
”) may have determined that certain countries' data protection laws provide an equivalent level of protection to the LGPD. Where this is not the case, we will only transfer your personal data to third parties located in other countries when there are appropriate safeguards in place which the ANPD has confirmed as acceptable.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism we use when transferring your personal data.
7.
Data retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
By law, we must keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial, and transaction data) for seven years after they cease being customers, for tax purposes.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes—in which case, we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
8.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you may have rights under Data Privacy Law in relation to your personal data. In addition to the rights discussed in the opt-out section above, you may have the following rights.
Request access to your personal data, commonly known as a data subject access request. This enables you to know the personal data we have collected from and about you.
Request correction of your personal data. This enables you to correct or update any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete your personal data. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data when you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), when we may have processed your information unlawfully, or when we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which we will inform you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data for certain purposes. You may object to the processing of your personal data when we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) for the processing, and you believe that your rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interest. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling, legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. You also have the right to request that we do not use your personal data for direct or targeted marketing.
Request that we restrict the processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) when you believe that our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) when you need us to hold the data, even if we no longer require it, such as when you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. If we are processing sensitive personal data, such as your health data, you may ask that we limit our processing of that data in certain circumstances. Limiting this processing may compromise your access to the full capabilities of our services, such as goal tracking or heart rate monitoring.
Request transfer of a copy of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party that you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Right to withdraw consent at any time when we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Right to Non-Discrimination. You have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised your privacy rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing. We use tracking technologies, like cookies, beacons, Ad IDs, IP addresses and pixels for online advertising and analytics. We may disclose certain online identifiers with our advertising partners and analytics providers. Disclosing these identifiers with third parties for advertising or analytics purposes may be defined as the “sale” or “sharing” of your information under Data Privacy Law. You may have the right to opt-out of these uses. If you opt-out this type of “sale” or “sharing” of your information, we will not deliver customized advertising to you. You may still see non-targeted advertising about our products and services. You may opt-out of the sale or sharing of your information for marketing or analytics by clicking on the
"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”
link and unselecting marketing and analytics cookies. We also recognize the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal. As described on
www.globalprivacycontrol.org
, GPC is “a proposed specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It consists of a setting or extension in the user's browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification.” You can download and enable the GPC via a participating browser or browser extension. Note that not all browsers support GPC. For more information, visit:
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about
.
If you wish to exercise any of the other rights set out above, you may submit a verifiable consumer request to us either by completing this
form
or calling us at
1.866.608.1798
We typically do not charge a fee to exercise these rights. However, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
You may use an authorized agent to submit your consumer rights requests on your behalf if you provide the authorized agent written permission to do so. We will not act upon a request from an authorized agent if the agent does not submit proof (your written permission) that the agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf. We will not act upon a request if we believe it is fraudulent.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Appeals or Complaints
If we deny your request to exercise a particular consumer right, in certain circumstances, you may have the right to appeal that decision.
If you are in the EEA or UK, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your jurisdiction. For example, the supervisory authority for data protection issues in the UK is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)
ico.org.uk
.
If the LGPD applies to the processing of your personal data with us, the LGPD grants you the right to lodge a complaint with the ANPD if you are not satisfied with how we process your personal data.
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before your supervisory authority, so please contact us in the first instance.
Advertising Disclaimer
iFIT shares no affiliation with any political party or its views. iFIT ads visible on political websites are there as a result of remarketing—not a partnership, affiliation, or endorsement.
Children's Information
Our services are not offered to children. We do not knowingly collect, use, sell or share the personal data of children that are less than 16 years of age.
9.
Risk of harm
Whenever personal data is collected and processed, there is always a slight risk that the personal data may be breached, misused, or otherwise result in a harm to you. However, we take several measures to ensure that this risk is mitigated as much as possible. These measures include limiting the personal data about you that we collect and process to solely what is necessary, and implementing appropriate security measures, as described in this Notice.

It consists of a setting or extension in the user's browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification.” You can download and enable the GPC via a participating browser or browser extension.

International transfers
We share your personal data within the iFIT group. We store the information we collect—including your personal data—in the United States, so if you are accessing an iFIT site from another country, your information is being transferred to and from the United States and specifically outside of the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”) or Brazil.
We ensure that your personal data is protected by requiring all of iFIT's companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. Moreover, sensitive and private data exchanged between an iFIT site and you occurs over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.
We want you to feel confident using the iFIT Products. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal data, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal data and should avoid sending personal data through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website
www.consumer.ftc.gov
for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
Note if you are located in the EU
: Whenever we transfer your personal data, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using an approved data transfer mechanism, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (“
SCCs
”) approved by the European Commission, which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Note if you are located in Brazil
: Some of these third parties may be located outside of Brazil. In some cases, the Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (“
ANPD
”) may have determined that certain countries' data protection laws provide an equivalent level of protection to the LGPD. Where this is not the case, we will only transfer your personal data to third parties located in other countries when there are appropriate safeguards in place which the ANPD has confirmed as acceptable.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism we use when transferring your personal data.
7.
Data retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
By law, we must keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial, and transaction data) for seven years after they cease being customers, for tax purposes.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes—in which case, we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you may have rights under Data Privacy Law in relation to your personal data. In addition to the rights discussed in the opt-out section above, you may have the following rights.
Request access to your personal data, commonly known as a data subject access request. This enables you to know the personal data we have collected from and about you.
Request correction of your personal data. This enables you to correct or update any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete your personal data. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data when you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), when we may have processed your information unlawfully, or when we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which we will inform you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data for certain purposes. You may object to the processing of your personal data when we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) for the processing, and you believe that your rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interest. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling, legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. You also have the right to request that we do not use your personal data for direct or targeted marketing.
Request that we restrict the processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) when you believe that our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) when you need us to hold the data, even if we no longer require it, such as when you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. If we are processing sensitive personal data, such as your health data, you may ask that we limit our processing of that data in certain circumstances. Limiting this processing may compromise your access to the full capabilities of our services, such as goal tracking or heart rate monitoring.
Request transfer of a copy of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party that you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Right to withdraw consent at any time when we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Right to Non-Discrimination. You have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised your privacy rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.
Right to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing. We use tracking technologies, like cookies, beacons, Ad IDs, IP addresses and pixels for online advertising and analytics. We may disclose certain online identifiers with our advertising partners and analytics providers. Disclosing these identifiers with third parties for advertising or analytics purposes may be defined as the “sale” or “sharing” of your information under Data Privacy Law. You may have the right to opt-out of these uses. If you opt-out this type of “sale” or “sharing” of your information, we will not deliver customized advertising to you. You may still see non-targeted advertising about our products and services. You may opt-out of the sale or sharing of your information for marketing or analytics by clicking on the
"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”
link and unselecting marketing and analytics cookies. We also recognize the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal. As described on
www.globalprivacycontrol.org
, GPC is “a proposed specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It consists of a setting or extension in the user's browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification.” You can download and enable the GPC via a participating browser or browser extension. Note that not all browsers support GPC. For more information, visit:
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about
.
If you wish to exercise any of the other rights set out above, you may submit a verifiable consumer request to us either by completing this
form
or calling us at
1.866.608.1798
We typically do not charge a fee to exercise these rights. However, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
You may use an authorized agent to submit your consumer rights requests on your behalf if you provide the authorized agent written permission to do so. We will not act upon a request from an authorized agent if the agent does not submit proof (your written permission) that the agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf. We will not act upon a request if we believe it is fraudulent.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Appeals or Complaints
If we deny your request to exercise a particular consumer right, in certain circumstances, you may have the right to appeal that decision.
If you are in the EEA or UK, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your jurisdiction. For example, the supervisory authority for data protection issues in the UK is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)
ico.org.uk
.
If the LGPD applies to the processing of your personal data with us, the LGPD grants you the right to lodge a complaint with the ANPD if you are not satisfied with how we process your personal data.
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before your supervisory authority, so please contact us in the first instance.
Advertising Disclaimer
iFIT shares no affiliation with any political party or its views. iFIT ads visible on political websites are there as a result of remarketing—not a partnership, affiliation, or endorsement.
Children's Information
Our services are not offered to children. We do not knowingly collect, use, sell or share the personal data of children that are less than 16 years of age.
9.
Risk of harm
Whenever personal data is collected and processed, there is always a slight risk that the personal data may be breached, misused, or otherwise result in a harm to you. However, we take several measures to ensure that this risk is mitigated as much as possible. These measures include limiting the personal data about you that we collect and process to solely what is necessary, and implementing appropriate security measures, as described in this Notice.

California privacy notice
(Notice at Collection)
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the CCPA) requires that business disclose certain additional information about how it collects, uses, discloses, sells, or shares for cross-context behavioral advertising the personal data of a California resident. This California Privacy Notice (Notice at Collection) is part of iFIT's
Notice.
This section only applies to California residents.
Personal Data We Collect About You
We may collect the following categories of personal data from or about you:
Identity data
includes first name, last name, username, or similar identifier, date of birth, and gender.
Contact data
includes billing address, mailing address, email address, and telephone numbers.

includes bank account and payment card details.
Transaction data
includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.

Profile data
includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback, and survey responses. It may also include information you share about your workouts or fitness goals, such as videos of a workout. We may use information that you share to create a profile of your aspirations, goals, and accomplishments to provide you with suggestions to help you reach the next level in your fitness challenge.
Health/Sensitive data
could be included in your profile. This data could include health data, including height and weight data, exercise data, including heartrate data, or other physical patterns or rhythms from your workouts or fitness goals. Under Data Privacy Law, this data may be classified as sensitive and be entitled to additional protections.
Usage data
includes information about how you use our Sites, products, and services.
Marketing and communications data
includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.
Social Media Application data
includes your public profile information, your social media connections, photos and "likes."
Geolocation information
may be recorded when you use certain features of our apps, which may be uploaded to your profile when synced with your account. We may collect precise geolocation information when you connect our Services to certain third-party apps, such as Strava, Garmin, Google or Apple.
Professional or Employment-Related data
includes information you provide on a job application or resume, including past employment or qualifications.
We also collect, use, and share
aggregated data
, such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data, but is not considered personal data under Data Privacy Law, as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature, data entered when using iFIT Sites, pages most frequently accessed, browser type, links a user clicks, and other similar information. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data, so it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Notice.
How We Use Your Personal Data
We will only use your personal data in a manner that is consistent with Data Privacy Law. Most commonly, we will use the categories of personal data listed above for the following business purposes:
When we need to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
For the provision of our products and services or the operation of our business or a third party's business. All of our employees and contractors are required to follow our data privacy and security policies when handling personal data.
For providing you with customized and personalized recommendations for other iFIT health or fitness opportunities that we think may be of interest to you.
To analyze and understand our members use patterns, improve our services and optimize the features of our services.
To evaluate your qualifications for a job position.
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
When we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Where we need to protect your (or someone else's) interests.
Where necessary in connection with the sale, merger, acquisition or other reorganization of our business.
For marketing purposes.
To process transactions.
Sale or Sharing of Personal Data
As explained above, we use digital technologies, like cookies, beacons, Ad IDs, IP addresses and pixels for online advertising and analytics. We may disclose certain online identifiers with our advertising partners and analytics providers. Disclosing these identifiers with third parties for advertising or analytics purposes may be defined as the “sale” or “sharing” of your information under the CCPA. You have the right to opt-out of these uses. If you opt-out this type of “sale” or “sharing” of your information, we will not deliver customized advertising to you. You may still see non-targeted advertising about our products and services. You may opt-out of the sale or sharing of your information for marketing or analytics by clicking on the
“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”
page which contains our Notice of the Right to Opt-Out and opt-out mechanism or call us at
1.866.608.1798
We also recognize the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal. As described on
www.globalprivacycontrol.org
, GPC is “a proposed specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It consists of a setting or extension in the user's browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification.” You can download and enable the GPC via a participating browser or browser extension. Note that not all browsers support GPC. For more information, visit:

We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA, or different prices, rates, levels, or quality of goods or services that are reasonably related to your personal data's value to the business. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. For more information about the CCPA-permitted financial incentives that we offer, see our
Notice of Financial Incentive.
Shine the Light
California Civil Code Section
1798.83

We offer these incentives to encourage consumers to try our products and services or to learn more about our offerings.

You may revoke your consent and withdraw from a financial incentive program at any time by doing one of the following:

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
