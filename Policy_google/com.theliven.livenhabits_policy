    We also collect data automatically when you use the Product (for example, your IP address, device type).
2.1. Data you give us
You provide us data about yourself when you register for and/or use the Product, for example, when you 
    create a user profile (“Profile”), respond to our emails, or report a problem. The data that you give us includes:
Profile data.
This includes your email address and password.
2.2. Data we collect automatically:
Data about how you found us.
We collect data about your referring URL (that is, the place 
    on the Web where you were when you tapped on our ad).
Cookies and other similar technologies.
As further described in our Cookie Policy, our Product 
    uses cookies that record data about the use of our Product to distinguish you from other users. You can control 
    cookies through your browser settings.
Browser and Device data.
We collect data from or about the devices from which you access the 
    Product, depending on the permissions you’ve granted. We may associate the data we collect from your different 
    devices, which helps us provide consistent Services across your devices. Examples of such data include language 
    settings, IP address, location, time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating system, 
    Internet service provider, mobile carrier, hardware ID, and Facebook ID.
We also collect your Apple Identifier for Advertising (“IDFA”) or Google Advertising ID (“AAID”) (depending on

    operating system (but we do not control this).

3. FOR WHAT PURPOSES DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
We process your personal data:
3.1. to provide services to you
This includes enabling you to use the Product in a seamless manner and preventing or addressing Product 
    errors or technical issues. For example, we use your data to authenticate you and authorize access to our 
    Product.
To provide personalized support and enhance your experience with our AI assistant, we process general 
    information about how you interact with the chat. This includes details on which features you access, such 
    as chat refresh actions, popups viewed and responded to, prompt clicks, exit actions, and the frequency of 
    use, helping us better understand overall engagement patterns, including your feedback. Importantly, we do 
    not collect or store the specific content of your messages.
We utilize OpenAI as a third-party provider for AI chat functionality within our app. Chat data may be shared 
    with OpenAI and retained for up to 30 days solely for security and misuse monitoring purposes. OpenAI does

    development. We analyze the data we have to evaluate our Product, and conduct audits and troubleshooting 
    activities to improve our Product content and layouts. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve the

    often use certain section of the Product, we may focus on improving this section.
