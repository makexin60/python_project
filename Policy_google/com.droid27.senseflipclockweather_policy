EULA.
By choosing to use our Apps or Services you agree to the collection of
                            information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Please note that the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as

2. Information we collect and use
When you interact with our Apps, our trusted partners may collect information
                            about your device. The process of collecting data is designed so that it avoids
                            collection of information that identifies you personally, such as your name,
                            address, email address or similar; instead, the information collected does
                            enable us and our partners to recognize your device over time for purposes of
                            improving the quality of our products and your experience with them.
As a general rule, we do not collect or share any information that may be used
                            to identify you as a person except when you contact us by email. In that case we
                            will save your emails in order to serve you better. Once we are finished
                            providing support to you we will delete all emails received by and sent to you.
                            Please note that we take all the necessary steps to safeguard any personal
                            information you may provide by email using strong passwords and 2-step
                            authentication.
Information that is collected by our partners may be divided into the following
                            categories.
A. Information for showing personalized ads
Note: This section (Section A) applies only to Apps that display ads. 
                            It does not apply to the following:
1. Apps that do not display ads
2. Pro (Ad-free) Apps that are available with a one-time purchase
3. Apps that have been upgraded to Premium via a paid subscription and do not display ads
In order to provide our Apps to you for free we display ads. To display ads,                                 
                            we work with our ad partners who may have their SDK/API integrated with our Apps. 
                            In order to improve user targeting, which is important for 
                            interest-based ads and marketing solutions relevant to the user, our partners may obtain 
                            and lawfully use information such as the following:
a)
Device and account identifiers
- Ad id (advertising id), app set ID and other 
                            identifiers related to accounts that are signed-in on the device.
b)
IP address
- Can be used to estimate the general location of a device
c)
User product interactions and interaction information
- App launches, taps and video views
d)
Diagnostic information
- Information is related to the performance of our Apps and the SDK, 
                            crash logs, app launch time, hang time and energy usage.

- Ad networks may obtain your location in order to show to you relevant ads.
This information may be shared with their clients for the permitted purposes stated above
                            (whether within or outside of the country of origin). All such collection permitted
                            processing and transfer will be in accordance with applicable data privacy laws.
You may opt-out of seeing personalized ads by choosing the relevant option on the popup window the first time you run our app, 
                            or by choosing the 'Update consent' option under the settings section of our apps. Note that this applies for users in the European Union and the UK.
B. Information for analyzing application performance issues and crashes
In order to improve our Apps, we use third party services (our analytics partners)
                            to collect and analyze error and performance issues. The information
                            collected in the case of an error is divided into two categories.
Device/hardware information
Includes information such as device model,
                                    screen information, total memory, internal and external storage, device language,
                                    and Android version
Error or performance related information
Includes error description,
                                    time that the error occurred, stack trace (a detailed error report), free
                                    memory and free disk space at the time of the error, etc.
This data helps us analyze and correct performance issues and errors
                            and improve your experience with our Apps.
C. Information for app functionality
Some information may be used to enable additional functionality in some of our apps. 
                            The information that we use to do this includes the following:
Installed applications
In case you choose to assign a custom application to one of our widget hot spots we obtain 
                                    all applications that are installed on your device; this is needed so that we can present you with a list of the 
                                    applications you have installed and you can choose which one to launch when you click on a widget hot spot. Any application-related information we 
                                    access does not leave your device - we simply use it to show you the list of your apps.
Precise location (or fine location)
In case you choose to let our app follow your location (you choose the 'Use my location' option under settings)
                                    our app will detect your current location at a specific time intervals and provide you with local weather forecasts and notifications.
Note that the above information is used locally - we do not share or transmit any of this information.
D. Information for improving our services
When you use our Apps, we use our analytics partners to collect usage statistics
                            and trends. The reason we collect this information is so that we can improve
                            your experience with our Apps by improving existing functionality and adding new
                            functionality.
The information that we collect in this case includes information that is
                            collected in section B above as well as usage statistics. Usage statistics
                            include information on how often a user opens a specific page inside the app,
                            icons and themes used, widgets used, etc.
