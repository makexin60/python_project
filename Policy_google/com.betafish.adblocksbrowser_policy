This Privacy Policy describes AdBlock's information practices for its website, browser extension, and applications. We take your privacy seriously
                and want you to understand exactly what information we collect, how we process that information, which pieces of information you can
                request us to remove, and how to contact us about this policy. Please read this policy carefully.
When it comes to your personal information, most of this policy applies to users who choose to donate to support AdBlock or purchase one of our
                paid products.
If all you do is use the extension then you're practically, except for an anonymous, unique ID, invisible to us.

What is personal information?
The purpose of data protection is to protect personal information. Personal information means any information relating to an identified
                or identifiable natural person ("
data subject
"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
                in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more
                factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. This
                information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also information in connection with payments.
Information AdBlock collects
Personal information
When you visit the AdBlock website we collect IP address, unique ID, logging of some of the button clicks on our website (clicking download,
                for example) and user event logging data. When the AdBlock extension communicates with AdBlock servers, we receive the computer’s IP address.
                After six months we will remove any identifying information such as IP address from our log files and databases.
When you donate from the AdBlock website, we collect and store all information, excluding the credit card number, given during
                the payment process. This includes IP address, unique ID, logging some of the button clicks (payment, download buttons) and user event logging.
                AdBlock does not handle or have access to full credit card numbers, bank account details or payment account login information. Each payment
                processor stores and uses the data you provide them differently.
AdBlock uses Stripe, PayPal and Paddle as payment processors when you donate to AdBlock. To learn more about their data collection policies, please consult their respective privacy policies available
here
,
here
and
here
when using them.
AdBlock uses Firebase Functions from Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. to ingest and process log messages from
		        the AdBlock extensions and the getadblock.com website.  Log messages are not kept on Firebase Functions after processing.  Firebase Functions keeps
		        the requester's IP address and other networking information in its system logs for 30 days.
AdBlock uses MoEngage to run donation campaigns and first run page. AdBlock collects and shares extension ID, metadata associated
                with the request such as network-based geo-location, language, user-agent and additional meta data associated with the message such
                as type of message to optimise performance in running campaigns. To learn more about MoEngage's data collection policies, please
                consult their respective privacy policies.
AdBlock Premium
When you purchase or otherwise obtain a AdBlock Premium license AdBlock will store information regarding the license, including:
                unique extension identifiers associated with the license, email associated with the license, last license check timestamp and license
                status. This data will be stored during the active lifetime of the license and for a period after cancellation.
The same data that is stored when you make a donation to AdBlock is stored when you purchase Premium.
AdBlock Premium - Sync
If you elect to use the Sync feature of AdBlock Premium then AdBlock collects information about the particular extension installation, including: unique
                extension identifier, sync device name and the timestamp of when the sync enrollment was made. This data will be stored during the active lifetime of
                the license and for a period after cancellation.
AdBlock also stores the entire set of extension settings in plain text on our servers to accommodate the sync functionality across multiple extension
                installations. This storage location has restricted access and is only made available to AdBlock employees to diagnose and fix errors with the sync
                service. Every reasonable precaution is taken to secure this storage location but no database or server is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the
                absolute security of the extension settings data. If you have concerns about the AdBlock extension settings data being compromised, since there is
                no current mechanism to encrypt the data from the user's end, please carefully consider whether you want to use this feature.
Finally, AdBlock Premium - Sync uses PubNub for real time sync notifications. Please refer to the
PubNub privacy policy
for information on their data collection policies. PubNub is used to alert the extension of a new settings version only
                and does not have access to the extension settings information.
AdBlock VPN
When you purchase an AdBlock VPN license, AdBlock will store information regarding the license, including: unique identifiers associated with the license,
                email associated with the license, last license check timestamp and license status. This data will be stored during the active lifetime of the license and
                for a period after cancellation.
We use the analytic services from Firebase Events from Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. on an opt-in basis to analyze
                and improve the functionality of our software and to optimize your user experience. In each instance, only anonymized data is utilized.
Please note, we do not collect any data about the web pages you visit or the services you use on the internet. Furthermore, we don’t—and never will—sell
                or share any data about your browsing habits.
Mobile applications
When using our mobile products, we collect data when specific interactions take place ("event tracking"), including: app/extension version, type of device, IP address, anonymous interaction events (like button clicks) and the platform (Android, iOS) used. We also collect data related to unexpected crashes or errors to analyze and solve any malfunctions, including: app/extension version, type of device, UUID and crash traces, instance and application IDs, free space and free ram, as well as the timestamp of the crash.
Data on event tracking is deleted after 60 days. Crash reports are retained for 180 days, related Instance IDs are deleted in accordance with Firebase’s retention policies.
For both event tracking and crash reporting, the data collection is solely used to improve the functionality and user experience of our mobile products and can be opted-out in the settings menu. We use the analytic services from Firebase Events from Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. on an opt-out basis to analyze and improve the functionality of our mobile applications and to optimize your user experience. In each instance, only anonymized data is utilized.
We use the services of RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases. We only provide RevenueCat with the minimum amount of data required to process your purchase in accordance with the
Data Processing Addendum
we entered into with RevenueCat, Inc. For more details, please see RevenueCat’s
privacy policy
.
Anonymous information
The AdBlock extension captures anonymous usage information including, but not limited to, the version number of the extension, preferred language,
                Acceptable Ads opt-in, opt-in to advanced features like our local content caching service, number of blocked requests, number of ads blocked, and
                browser and operating system type. The AdBlock extension also assigns an anonymous, unique ID to each installation. We store aggregate statistics
                about the installation connected with each user ID indefinitely. We utilize this information to help us identify and fix potential issues with
                AdBlock as well as to determine the performance of AdBlock features.
The iOS extension captures connection type (wifi or mobile) in addition to the data that the browser extension captures.
Extension error information
An error report is automatically sent to AdBlock's servers whenever an error occurs in the extension. The report contains the anonymous
                information stated previously along with the current browser version and a description of the error. If a URL exists in the error description
                then the extension will attempt to remove it. The data is used for troubleshooting and to identify general defects which lead to unexpected
                crashes or errors. After 7 days we will remove this information from our log files and databases.
Server logs
Logs for general requests made to getadblock.com or its infrastructure are kept for up to 90 days. These logs include the IP address, browser,
                operating system, and page address. We will anonymize the IP address by using a hash to encrypt this information and we will immediately
                delete the original IP address. This data is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues. After
                90 days, we will remove this information from our log files and databases.
Logs for payment processing requests are kept in accordance with US tax law retention periods and will be deleted after the end of the
                respective retention period. Information in these logs includes IP address, email (if provided), address (if provided), name (if provided),
                browser type and version, operating system, payment amount, payment type, card type, expiration date, and last four digits of the card if a card is used.
                This data is used to provide insights into the financial performance of AdBlock.
For non-EU/EEA users only: Google Analytics
AdBlock uses Google Analytics for non-EU/EEA users only to aggregate information about traffic patterns and how our website, extensions, and mobile applications are used. We limit the data sent to Google Analytics, and only do so to improve our extension and website. You can find information about Google Analytics’ data collection

How AdBlock processes and discloses collected information
We try to make AdBlock better
We use the collected usage and analytics information to maintain and improve the AdBlock extension and website, gain insight into how
                our services are being used, and in our efforts to prevent fraud. The information is only used internally.
Your information is not for sale
AdBlock never has and never will sell your personal information to any third party without your consent. We sometimes share anonymized and
                aggregated information that cannot be associated with an individual with third parties or the public.
AdBlock discloses personal information as required by law
AdBlock cooperates with all valid United States law enforcement requests and court orders. If possible, we'll notify you of requests for
                your information using the email stored in our system. Some circumstances prohibit us from contacting you about a request or order (e.g.
                an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) or § 215 of the Patriot Act).
"Warrant canary"
:
                AdBlock has never received an order under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, and if this sentence ever disappears, you'll know it's because we
                have received such an order -- or similar order -- and the U.S. Government made us delete it.
AdBlock discloses personal information as part of business development
As part of the further development of our business, it may happen that the structure of Adblock, Inc. changes. The legal structure may be
                adapted, subsidiaries, business units or components may be created, bought or sold. In such transactions user information may be shared with
                the transmitted part of the company. In the event of a transfer of personal information Adblock, Inc. will ensure that it is done in
                accordance with this privacy policy and the GDPR and applicable EU laws.
We will not transfer your personal data to third parties as a matter of course without letting you know in advance. We will ask for your
                prior permission unless the transfer of such data is permitted by GDPR or any other applicable EU laws.
External services
AdBlock uses external services that may require you to enter personal information. We currently use
                ZenDesk (privacy policy
here
) for AdBlock's
knowledge base and support system
. AdBlock has used other services in the past
                and may use more in the future. We do not control the data on these external services and can not remove or delete the data;
                any data given to external services is not bound by this policy, and you should read the external service's privacy policy before providing any information.
Data security
All personal and usage information that AdBlock collects is stored in our databases and AdBlock takes reasonable steps to keep it secure.
                That said, no database or server is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data in our system or while being
                transmitted over the Internet. Our best effort is given, but you use AdBlock's website and browser extension at your own risk.
What is the legal basis?
We collect and process your personal information in compliance with the GDPR and the applicable EU laws.
Collection and processing is based on your consent: Art. 6 (1) a GDPR, Art. 4 (11) GDPR
We will always ask for your consent to collect and process your personal information for the aforementioned specific purposes, unless the
                collection and processing of your personal information is permitted by statutory laws. Where you have provided us with your consent to the
                collection and processing of your personal information for the aforementioned specific purposes, you have the right to withdraw your consent
                at any time.
Collection and processing is necessary for taking steps prior to enter into a contract: Art. 6 (1) b GDPR
The collection and processing of your personal information may be necessary for the performance of a contract to which you may be a party.
                Prior to entering into such a contract, the collection and processing of your personal information may also be necessary in order to take steps
                at your request. This applies for installation and the use of our extension as well as any payment processing in connection with donations.
Collection and processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject: Art. 6 (1) c GDPR
Collection and processing of your personal information may be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject under
                EU laws or the laws of a EU Member State.
Collection and processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests: Art. 6 (1) f GDPR
The collection and processing of your personal information may be necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. We collect and process
                server logs for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, preventing denial of service attacks. Denial of service is typically accomplished
                by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests
                from being fulfilled. Preventing such overloads of our systems and any security issues by denial of service attacks is in your and our vital interest
                and therefore we use the website logs. We use information collected and processed via subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency
                notifications and feedback data sent by you, for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, ensuring the security of the extension version used
                by you. Ensuring the security of our extension is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data. Furthermore, we collect and process
                such data to ensure that our website and extension are constantly improved and adjusted to the changing requirements for an efficient usability
                and the technical environment. Ensuring the usability of our websites and of our extension is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data.
Jointly determining purposes and means of data processing: Art. 26 (1) GDPR
To build and improve upon products and features more efficiently, we share personal data, in compliance with GDPR, within the context of a joint controllership with partners. This does not affect how we process personal data as outlined in this privacy policy or how you can exercise your data subject’s rights towards us. You can always contact us with questions or feedback about our privacy policy
here
and can receive the essence of the arrangement between us and our partners via e-mail to
privacy@adblock.org

How We Respond to DNT Signals
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a Do Not Track signal to websites and other online services you visit. We do not alter our practices when we receive a Do Not Track signal from a visitor’s browser because we do not track our visitors to provide targeted advertising. To find out more about Do Not Track, please visit

Public forums
The site may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and avoid posting any personal information.
Child safety
The site is intended for use only by persons who are at least 16 years of age. By using the site, you confirm to us that you meet this requirement. If you are under the age of 16, you confirm you have received permission from your parent or guardian before using this site or sending us personal information.
Payment processing
Payment details you provide will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology before they are submitted to us over the internet. Payments made on the site are made through our payment gateway provider. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to the operator which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorizing payment. Information which you supply is not within our control and is subject to the operator’s own privacy policy and terms and conditions.
How we protect your information
Security is one of our biggest priorities at RevenueCat. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
All application data is secured in transit using TLS.
Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL.
RevenueCat audits changes to the application throughout the development lifecycle: architecture reviews are performed as well as stringent automated and manual code review processes.
RevenueCat monitors application servers, infrastructure, and the RevenueCat network environment to detect potential abuse.
RevenueCat uses Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) to persistently store Customer data and does not host Customer data on its premises. AWS is a leading cloud provider, and holds industry best security certifications, such as SOC2 and ISO 27001. Customer data sent to RevenueCat from around the world is sent to AWS data centers located in the United States.
How long we keep your information
We retain personal data during any period in which you have expressed an interest in our products and services, for as long as you have an account with us in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for six years after that to identify any issues and resolve any legal proceedings. We may also retain aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services. You cannot be identified from aggregate information retained or used for these purposes.

Data processed on behalf of our Customers
RevenueCat may process End User Information on behalf of its customers. We are not the controllers of this data and act as data processors, and have no direct relationship with the individuals or end users whose personal information it processes. The processing of personal data sent from our Customers is governed by our
Terms of Use
,
Data Processing Addendum
or any other agreement agreed to and signed by us with our Customers. These agreements cover data transfers to third parties that may occur as part of RevenueCat’s provision of its services to the customer. We will process such data on behalf of the customer as prescribed in the respective agreements between RevenueCat and the customer. The customer’s privacy policy or other agreement between the customer and you (or your organization) will apply to such processing, and not this policy.
If your personal data is processed by RevenueCat on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to discontinue such processing, or if you seek to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, please contact the RevenueCat customer (the data controller) directly. The RevenueCat customer should then provide instructions to us, if necessary. If requested to remove data by the data controller we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We will retain personal information pursuant to our retention policy and will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Note to users outside the United States

In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal data.
