Privacy Policy
Last Updated JANUARY 3, 2023
We at Vector Unit respect your right to privacy.  This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and utilized by Vector Unit, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.  This Privacy Policy applies to personal information that we collect through our mobile, PC and console
Games
, and at our
Website
at
www.vectorunit.com
(together, “
Services
”).
If after reading this you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your personal information, please send an email to
info@vectorunit.com
and we will try to address it.
What personal information does Vector Unit collect and why?
Vector Unit is a gaming company, headquartered in California, in the United States of America.   Our main business is to develop and publish game applications online via distribution networks like Apple iTunes or Steam.  For more information about Vector Unit, please see the
About Us
section of our Website.
The personal information that we may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories:  When you play our Games or visit our Website, we may collect certain information automatically from your device; this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.  Also from time to time, you may send us personal information voluntarily, for example when you email us for support.
Information that we collect automatically in our Games
We automatically collect certain types of anonymous information when you interact with some of our Games, via a 3rd party analytics partner such as
Flurry
.  This information is stored in our partner's servers, and visible to us in aggregated or pseudonymized form which does not focus on you individually.
Specifically, this may include information like your device type, unique device identification numbers, broad geographic location (e.g. country derived from IP address) and technical information such as crash reporting.  In addition, we may collect information about your interactions with our Games, such as how long you play for, or whether you've encountered any technical glitches.
This type of anonymized data enables us to figure out how players use our Games, so we can make improvements to our Games over time, such as fixing bugs or identifying areas of the game which are too difficult.
In addition, in some of our free to play games we also partner with mobile advertising networks, such as
AdColony
.  Each of these companies collect some pseudonymized usage data from players, such as whether or not a player finishes watching an ad all the way through, or whether or not a user clicks on an ad.
For information about exercising your data rights with our 3rd party partners, please see
Contacting our partners
below.
Apple Arcade
Please note that the Apple Arcade version of our games does not collect any of the above mentioned information from your device. The single exception is for multiplayer: we read your Game Center gamer ID and gamertag in order to connect you with other players and post to leaderboards. Aside from that, no data is collected, stored, or transmitted.
Information that we collect automatically on our Website
Our website is hosted by
Squarespace
, which uses cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “
Cookies
”) to collect and use personal information about you.  For further information about the types of Cookies used by Squarespace, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see the
Squarespace Cookie Notice
.
When you visit our Website, the information Squarespace collects automatically may include information like your IP address, device or browser type, unique device identification numbers, or broad geographic location (e.g. country).  This information is stored in our partner's servers, and visible to us in anonymous, aggregated or pseudonymized form which does not focus on you individually.
Viewing this information enables us to better understand the people who visit our Website, where they come from, and what content is of interest to them so we can improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.
For information about exercising your data rights with our 3rd party partners, please see
Contacting our partners
below.
Information that you provide voluntarily for authentication
Some of our games offer
Platform Services
which enable you to connect to other users or back up your save file online.  For example, you might log into iCloud on an iOS device, or Google Play Games Services on an Android device.  In such cases, we may get access to some information such as your Username or Gamertag. In such cases, we treat such information in accordance to the privacy mandates of the Platform Service, and of this Privacy Policy.
For information about exercising your data rights with our 3rd party partners, please see
Contacting our partners
below.
Information that you provide voluntarily for communication
Certain other parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily.  For example, when you sign up for our mailing list, we may ask you to provide your name and email address, or receive that information when you send us a support email.  The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide it.
At any time you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you may do so.  Please see
Your Data Subject Rights (DSRs)
below.
Legal basis for processing personal information
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
We will process your information for the purposes of operating our Website, Games and other Services and communicating with you as necessary for those purposes and in our legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, undertaking marketing activities, improving our Games, Website and other Services or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
Who does Vector Unit share my personal information with?
Generally speaking, we're in the business of making games, not sharing or selling data.  We take pains to protect your data and ensure that whatever data you share with us is used strictly for the purposes of improving our Services, and for staying in touch with our players and Website visitors.
However, we may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
to
third party services providers
and partners who provide data processing services to us, or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy.  See
Contacting our partners
below.
to
any competent law enforcement body
, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;
to a
potential or actual buyer
(and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
How does Vector Unit keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
Whenever possible the information we collect is anonymized, hashed, pseudonymized, or otherwise obscured, so that the information viewed is not linked to any identifiable individual by the person viewing it.
We limit access to all personal information, including such pseudonymized information, to individuals within the company who require that access (for example, tech support personnel, or analytics staff) and who have been trained on our privacy policies.
International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are a resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.
Specifically, our servers are located in the United States, and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Data retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Children
Our Services are intended for general audiences and Vector Unit does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at
info@vectorunit.com
. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable period of time.
Your Data Subject Rights (DSRs)
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their Data Subject Rights (DSRs) in accordance with applicable data protection laws.  When applicable, we will fulfil your requests ourselves. In the case of data which we do not directly maintain or store, we will refer you to the appropriate partner to fulfill your request.  For information about exercising your DSRs with our 3rd party partners, please see
Contacting our partners
below.
You have the following Data Subject Rights:
If you wish to
access, correct, update or request deletion
of your personal information, you can do so at any time by using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
In addition, you can
object to processing
of your personal information, ask us to
restrict processing
of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.

we send you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can
withdraw your consent
at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the
right to complain to a data protection authority
about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

here
.
Information Security and Data Retention
Yahoo has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store.
Yahoo will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the applicable Yahoo Services to you. In some cases, Yahoo has certain business or legal requirements that result in an obligation to retain your personal information for an extended period of time. These obligations may include financial record keeping, ensuring continuity of our products or services, security, fraud, and abuse prevention, or compliance with our legal obligations. In some limited cases, we may keep data for longer than needed for the purposes set out in the
Yahoo Privacy Dashboard
, such as: (i) replicating or backing up certain data to “offline” storage for disaster recovery purposes; (ii) truncating, redacting or summarizing raw data, log files and database records into statistical aggregate data or probabilistic data structures to understand long term trends; (iii) maintaining de-identified data for varying periods for research, reporting and product testing or development (in these cases, unique identifiers and linkages to existing data about you are broken or removed so that this data is no longer associated with you, your browser, or device); or (iv) keeping and using certain data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements (for example, we might keep data associated with an account subject to litigation or a request from law enforcement). For specific information about your personal information or how your personal information is processed by a particular Yahoo product or service you may interact with, please log into the
Yahoo Privacy Dashboard
.
Protecting Children’s Privacy
Our Services are for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use, or share information that could reasonably be used to identify children under age 13 without prior parental consent or consistent with applicable law. With parental permission, a child under age 13 might have a Yahoo Family Account. Visit
Children's Privacy & Family Accounts
to learn more about children’s privacy at Yahoo.
Our Legal Bases for Processing Information.
We mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information. First, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide our services to you, in accordance with our Terms of Service. This processing is necessary to perform the contract between you and us. Second, where you have given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent. Third, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests. Occasionally, Yahoo may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user’s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation. Please see our
Legal bases
page for more information.
Data Processing and Transfers
When you use or interact with any of our Services, you consent to the data processing, sharing, transferring and uses of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Regardless of the country where you reside, you authorize us to transfer, process, store and use your information in countries other than your own in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to provide you with Services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside.
Yahoo processes information related to individuals in the EU/EEA/UK/Switzerland and receives that information from the EU/EEA/UK/Switzerland through various compliance mechanisms, including the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. Where appropriate, we also rely on other transfer mechanisms such as data processing agreements based on Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission or the United Kingdom. For more information, please visit our
Data Transfer
page.
The United States and other non-EU/EEA/UK countries have different laws on data protection and rules in relation to government access to information. If you are based in the EU/EEA/UK, when your data is moved from your home country to a third country outside the EU/EEA/UK, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country.

Privacy Policy
Apple Privacy Control
Control is yours.
Privacy is built in from the beginning, from the moment you open your new device to every time you use an app. Here are a few things to know so you can be even more secure.
Update
Privacy and Security settings
Privacy and Security settings help you manage how much information you share across apps. Each data type shows how many apps are accessing that data, making it easier for you to find out and control how much information you’re sharing.
New
Passwords app
Safely store all your credentials, including passwords, verification codes, and security alerts, with end-to-end encryption in the Passwords app — and sync them all seamlessly across your devices.
New
Accessory Setup Kit
Accessory Setup Kit allows app developers to offer an intuitive way to pair accessories while protecting information about your nearby Bluetooth devices. This lets you seamlessly pair Bluetooth accessories with greater privacy.
New
Locked and hidden apps
Help protect sensitive apps and the information inside them. Lock an app to require Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode for access. Information from the app doesn’t appear in other places across the system, including search results and notifications, to help prevent others from inadvertently seeing your sensitive information. And you can easily hide an app, which moves it into a hidden and locked apps folder.
Safety Check
This section in iOS Settings helps you disconnect your iPhone from people, apps, and devices you no longer want to be connected to.
Learn more about personal safety with Apple devices
Sensitive Content Warning
Sensitive Content Warning helps you avoid seeing unwanted images and videos that may contain nudity by initially blurring them. It works in Messages, with AirDrop files, in FaceTime video messages, and in the Phone app when receiving a Contact Poster. This feature is optional and you can turn it on in Privacy & Security settings. All image and video processing occurs on your device, meaning that neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content.
Privacy Nutrition Labels
Product pages on the App Store feature a section that provides developers’ self‑reported summaries of some of their privacy practices in a simple, easy‑to‑read label. This shows how developers are collecting and using your data, including information like your location, browsing history, and contacts. This is part of ongoing work to increase transparency and control over your data, and Apple will continue to update this feature and work with developers to ensure that users can make informed choices.
Learn more about Privacy Nutrition Labels
See how apps from Apple handle your data
App Tracking Transparency
Your devices carry the story of your life. We believe you should have a choice in how apps track and share your data with other companies for advertising or with data brokers.
Starting with iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5, apps are required to ask your permission when they want to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. You can change your preference for any app or prevent apps from asking for permission entirely in Settings.
App Privacy Report
See at a glance what your apps have been up to when you turn on App Privacy Report. A section in Settings shows how often your location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts have been accessed during the last seven days. It also reveals which domains apps have contacted. Together with Privacy Nutrition Labels, this feature gives you a more complete picture of how the apps you use treat your privacy.
Pasteboard permission
Apps need to get your permission before accessing the pasteboard to paste content from another app.
Update
Third-party apps and permissions
Apple gives you transparency and control over the data you share with apps. Apps may request access to things such as your location, contacts, calendars, or photos. You’ll receive a prompt with an explanation the first time a third-party app wants to use this data, so you can make an informed decision about granting permission. Even if you grant access once, you can always change it later in Settings. You can also decide which contacts to share with an app, rather than giving it access to all your contacts. iOS and iPadOS require developers to get your permission before tracking you or your device across apps and websites owned by other companies for ad targeting, for ad measurement purposes, or to share your data with data brokers.
Mic and camera controls
No app can access the microphone or camera without your permission. In iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 or later, when an app uses the microphone or camera, your device displays an indicator to let you know it is being used — whether you are in the app, in another app, or on the Home Screen. And Control Center shows you when an app has recently used the microphone or camera. In iOS and iPadOS, access to the camera is disabled for an app when it is in the background. Sometimes apps need to know what other devices are on your local network, like when you’re trying to connect to a smart TV or printer. Starting with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, apps need to ask your permission before scanning your local network. iOS and iPadOS also let you know when an app accesses your Clipboard, so you can confirm that it receives access to only the items you expect.
Data and privacy information
Data and privacy information screens make it easy to understand how Apple will use your personal information before you sign in or start using new features. When you see the Data and Privacy icon, you’ll find helpful information on what personal data may be shared and how it will be used to improve your experience.
Location data
Sometimes it’s useful for your device to know your location, like when you’re setting up meetings in Calendar or getting directions. Location Services on your device uses a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, and crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspots and mobile towers to figure out where you are. Apple gives you control over the collection and use of this location data on all your devices. Starting with iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and watchOS 7, you can choose whether apps have access to your approximate location — an area of about 10 square miles — rather than your precise location. Location Services is not on by default. You can enable it when you first set up your device, and you can always turn it off if you change your mind.
View the Location Services Privacy white paper (PDF)
Data and Privacy page
To give you more control over your personal information, we provide a set of dedicated privacy management tools on your Data and Privacy page. These tools give you the ability to get a copy of your data, request a correction to your data, deactivate your account, or delete your account.
Learn more about taking control of your data
Visit your Data and Privacy page
Analytics
If you choose to opt in, your iOS and iPadOS devices can collect analytics about your device and any paired Apple Watch and send it to Apple for analysis. This analysis helps Apple improve products and reduce problems like apps crashing. The collected information does not identify you personally and can be sent to Apple only with your explicit consent. Analytics may include details about hardware and operating system specifications, performance statistics, and data about how you use your devices and applications. When it’s collected, personal data is either not logged at all, removed from reports before they’re sent to Apple, or protected by techniques such as Differential Privacy.
The information we gather using Differential Privacy helps us improve our services without compromising individual privacy. For example, this technology improves QuickType and emoji suggestions, as well as Lookup Hints in Notes.
We identify commonly used data types in the Health app and web domains in Safari that cause performance issues. This information allows us to work with developers to improve your experience without revealing anything about your individual behavior.
If you give your explicit consent to share iCloud Analytics, Apple can improve Siri and other intelligent features by analyzing how you use iCloud data from your account, such as text snippets from email messages. Analysis happens only after the data has gone through privacy-enhancing techniques like Differential Privacy so that it cannot be associated with you or your account.
Advertising
Apple is committed to delivering advertising in a way that respects your privacy. Apple‑delivered ads may appear on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks. The Apple advertising platform does not track you, nor does it buy or share your personal information with other companies. Your Apple Pay transactions, Health app data, and HomeKit app data are not used by the Apple advertising platform to deliver ads. Your App Store search and download history may be used to serve you relevant ads. In the Apple News and Stocks apps, ads are served based partly on what you read or follow. This includes the topics and categories of the stories you read and the publications you follow, subscribe to, or enable notifications from. The stories you read are not used to serve targeted ads to you outside these apps. You can view the information Apple uses to deliver relevant ads to you in Settings. You can also turn off Personalized Ads at any time in Settings to stop receiving targeted ads on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks. Turning off Personalized Ads will limit Apple’s ability to deliver relevant ads to you but may not reduce the number of ads you receive. The Apple advertising platform doesn’t serve ads to children under 13 years old and Managed Apple Accounts. In addition, Apple has strong guidelines for apps in the Kids category of the App Store, including prohibiting apps in the category from including third-party analytics or third-party advertising.
Update
Stolen Device Protection
Stolen Device Protection for iPhone enhances security when your device is away from familiar locations like home or work. It requires Face ID or Touch ID — with no passcode alternative or fallback — so that only you can access sensitive features such as stored passwords or credit cards. A security delay helps prevent immediate changes to critical settings if the device is stolen. This protection is available on iOS 17.3 or later and must be enabled in Settings.
Learn more about Stolen Device Protection
Lockdown Mode
Lockdown Mode helps defend against highly targeted spyware by providing optional protection for a specific group of users who face sophisticated digital attacks, such as those from private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Lockdown Mode in iOS 16 or later, iPadOS 16 or later, macOS Ventura or later, and Apple Watch hardens device defenses and limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the effectiveness of these spyware attacks.
Six-digit passcodes
Setting a passcode is the most important thing you can do to safeguard your device. The passcode on your Touch ID– or Face ID–enabled device is automatically set to six digits, creating a million possible combinations. You can also enable Erase Data in Settings to have your device wipe itself clean after 10 incorrect guesses.
Learn more about protecting your device with a passcode
Find My
Enabling Find My for iPhone, iPad, and Mac helps keep you connected to your device, even if it’s lost or stolen. Find My is built in a way that protects your privacy. It’s enabled automatically when you sign in to iCloud on a new device. You can see where your device is on a map — and where it has been — so you improve your chances of recovering it. If you’re unable to get your device back, you can remotely erase the personal data on it. Apple receives this location information only when you locate your device, turn on Lost Mode, or enable Send Last Location. Location data is only retained for 24 hours so we can display the last known location of your device. Find My also automatically turns on Activation Lock, which requires your Apple Account to be entered before anyone can erase or reactivate your device.
The Find My network harnesses hundreds of millions of Apple devices with Bluetooth technology. It helps you detect missing devices or items near other Apple devices and reports their approximate location back to you. This entire process is end-to-end encrypted, so your missing device’s location and information remains protected from Apple and third-party manufacturers.
Touch ID and Face ID
Touch ID and Face ID provide intuitive and secure authentication with the touch of a finger or a simple glance. Your fingerprint or face data is converted into a mathematical representation that is encrypted and used only by the Secure Enclave in your Mac, iPad, or iPhone. Since fingerprint and face data is so personal, your device takes extraordinary measures to protect it. This data can’t be accessed by the operating system on your device or by any applications running on it. And it is never stored on Apple servers or backed up to iCloud or anywhere else.
Learn more about Apple Platform Security
Two-factor authentication
Two-factor authentication is the best way to keep your information safe because it adds a second layer of security to your Apple Account. It’s designed to ensure that even someone who knows your password can’t access your account. When you sign in on a new device or from the web, a verification code will be displayed automatically on all your trusted devices. Enter this code along with your password and you’ll be signed in. Anyone who can’t provide both your password and the verification code will be kept out. Once signed in, you won’t be asked for a verification code on that device again unless you sign out completely, erase the device, or need to change your password for security reasons.
Learn how to set up two-factor authentication
AirTag alerts
iPhone will inform you of an AirTag that doesn’t belong to you but is detected to be traveling with you. Once it has been discovered, you can get instructions on how to disable it. To further guard against unwanted tracking, an AirTag separated from its owner for an extended period of time will play a sound to draw attention to it.
Learn more about AirTag and alerts
Pay attention to notifications.
When you sign in for the first time on a new device, update your payment method, change your password, or make other changes to your account, Apple notifies you with an email or a push notification. So if you receive a notification from us about a change that you don’t remember making, it could mean that someone has wrongfully accessed your account. If that happens, go to “Manage your Apple Account” to change your password immediately. If you need additional help, contact Apple Support for assistance.

Beware of phishing.
“Phishing” refers to fraudulent attempts to get personal information from you, such as your Apple Account password or credit card information, usually through an email or text message. The request may appear to be from a legitimate company or individual, but it’s not. Turning on two-factor authentication is the best way to protect yourself against phishing schemes designed to trick you into revealing your Apple Account credentials. Never provide your password, verification codes, or any other sensitive account information over email or text messages. If you receive what you believe to be a phishing email purporting to be from Apple, send it to
reportphishing@apple.com
.

                  but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our Amazon Services.
Automatic Information:
We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of
                  Amazon Services, including information about your interaction with products, content,

                  and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your
                  web browser or device accesses Amazon Services and other content served by or on behalf
                  of Amazon on other websites. Our physical stores may use cameras, computer vision,
                  sensors, and other technology to gather information about your activity in the store,
                  such as the products and services you interact with. Click
here
to see examples of what we collect.
Information from Other Sources:
We might receive information about you from other sources, such as updated delivery

here
to see additional examples of the information we receive.
For What Purposes Does Amazon Use Your Personal Information?
We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products
            and services that we offer our customers. These purposes include:
Purchase and delivery of products and services.
We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and

                  and promotional offers.
Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services.
We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix
                  errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the Amazon Services.
Recommendations and personalization.
We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that
                  might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience
                  with Amazon Services.
Provide voice, image and camera services.
When you use our voice, image and camera services, we use your voice input, images,
                  videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested
                  service to you, and improve our services. For more information about Alexa voice services
                  , click
here
.
Comply with legal obligations.
In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with laws.
                  For instance, we collect from sellers information regarding place of establishment
                  and bank account information for identity verification and other purposes.
Communicate with you.
We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services
                  via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat).
Advertising.
We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products,
                  and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally
                  identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our
Interest-Based Ads
notice.
Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks.
We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect
                  the security of our customers, Amazon, and others. We may also use scoring methods
                  to assess and manage credit risks.
What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?
To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve
            Amazon Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about
            cookies and how we use them, please read our
Cookies Notice
.
Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not
            in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share
            customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries Amazon.com,
            Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at
            least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by
                  third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products
                  from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application
                  providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services.
                  We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses,
                  such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
                  transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions
                  with that third party.
Third-Party Service Providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                  include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal
                  mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,
                  providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
                  listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing
                  and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service
                  providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
                  may not use it for other purposes.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services.
                  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
                  assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice
                  (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event
                  that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
                  will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Amazon and Others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate
                  to comply with the law; enforce or apply our
Conditions of Use
and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users,
                  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
                  for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about
            you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose
            not to share the information.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.
We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by
                  using encryption protocols and software.
We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the
                  collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security

Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and
                  loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs.

What About Advertising?
Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:
Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and
                  apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you
                  interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about
                  third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our
Interest-Based Ads
notice. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page.
Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:
We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more
                  useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share
                  your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead,
                  we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived
                  from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.
                  For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
                  identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download
                  the app again. While we do not share your specific shopping actions like purchases,
                  product views, or searches with ad companies, we may share an advertising identifier
                  and an estimate of the value of the ads they show you on our behalf so they can serve
                  you with more effective Amazon ads. Some ad companies also use this information to
                  serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out
                  of personalized advertising (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going
                  to the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page.
What Information Can I Access?
You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile
            information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the "Your
            Account" section of the website. Click
here
for a list of examples that you can access.
What Choices Do I Have?

            please contact our
Customer Service
. Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options
            as to how your information is being used.
As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information, but then you
                  might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in
What Information Can I Access?
. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our
                  records.
If you do not want to receive email or other communications from us, please adjust
                  your
Customer Communication Preferences
. If you don't want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification
                  settings in the app or device.

                  (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls
                  are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change
                  your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you
                  contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.
If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in
Seller Central
, update your account information by accessing your
Seller Account Information

Notification Preferences

                  the performance of our products and services, as well as learn more

            access to or delete your personal information. If you wish to do any of these things,
            you may go to
Data Privacy Queries

Effective Date: January 31, 2025
Squarespace (“Squarespace,” “we,” “us” or “our”) respects your privacy. When it comes to your personal information, we believe in transparency. That’s why we’ve set out here what personal information we collect, what we do with it and your choices and rights.
By using or accessing any of our sites, templates, products, applications, tools, services and features (collectively, the "Services"), you confirm you have agreed to the
Terms of Service
and have read and understood this Privacy Policy and our
Cookie Policy
. The Squarespace entity that controls your information depends on where you are located. See
Section 12 below
.
You can find out about your rights and choices in
Section 6 below
. We’ve also included at the end of this Privacy Policy some region-specific supplemental information if you are located in: (i)
California
; or (ii)
a U.S. state (other than California) with an applicable data privacy law
.
For clarity, we use different defined terms in this Privacy Policy to refer to the different parties who interact with our Services:
A “User” is someone who visits or uses one of our sites, such as
www.squarespace.com
,
www.acuityscheduling.com
,
www.unfold.com
or
www.biosites.com
or mobile applications.
A “Customer” is one of our Users who has an account with us. Customers may use our Services to register domain names, create websites (including scheduling pages) and other content, and otherwise manage and market their online businesses.
An “End User” is someone who visits, purchases from, makes a booking with or otherwise uses one of our Customer’s sites that was created using, and is hosted on, our Services.
We also use different terms in this Privacy Policy to differentiate between our roles under global data privacy laws with respect to the personal information we process:
“Squarespace Controlled Information” is personal information for which Squarespace acts as the “data controller” (or similar term under applicable law) and determines the purposes and means of processing. This includes information about our Users and Customers. We also act as an independent data controller for personal information relating to End Users which we automatically receive (including via cookies or similar tracking technology) when an End User visits a site hosted on our Services (such as the End User’s IP address) when we process it for our own purposes, including to foster the security and integrity of our Services.
“Customer Controlled Information” is personal information for which a Customer acts as the “data controller” (or similar term under applicable law) and determines the purposes and means of processing. This includes any personal information included in the content uploaded by a Customer to our Services for display on their site, a Customer’s domain registration contact information and all information about a Customer’s End Users (including information provided by an End User to a Customer via a webform on the Customer’s site as well as information automatically received (including via cookies or similar tracking technology) when an End User visits the Customer’s site).
We explain below how we collect and use Squarespace Controlled Information and your rights.  If you are an End User of one of our Customers’ sites: (a) read below to learn about how we collect and use your Site Usage Information (as described in
Section 2 below
); and (b) you should read that Customer’s site’s privacy policy to find out more about how they use and otherwise process Customer Controlled Information about you.

Appendix II. Other US States Supplemental Information
1. How does this Privacy Policy apply?
This Privacy Policy describes what we do with Squarespace Controlled Information, such as Customer account information, information about how Users use and interact with our Services, information Users submit to our customer support, and, when we use it for our own purposes, including to foster the security and integrity of our Services, End User information which is automatically collected when an End User visits a Customer’s site hosted on our Services.
We have separate privacy policies that apply in relation to our processing of personal information relating to our staff and applicants for jobs at a Squarespace group company.
We use cookies and similar technologies. Our
Cookie Policy
describes what we do in that regard.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to Customer Controlled Information as described above.
For Customer Controlled Information, Squarespace acts as a data processor, service provider or similar term under applicable law. This means we process a Customer’s Customer Controlled Information on behalf of, and pursuant to, the instructions of that particular Customer. We also use and disclose Customer Controlled Information:
to enforce our
Terms of Service
and other legal terms and policies;
to comply with applicable legal requirements, such as tax and other government regulations and industry standards, contracts or law enforcement requests; and
in the case of domain registration contact information, to comply with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”), registry, ccTLD or registrar rules, regulations and policies.
Our Customers are responsible for ensuring that their collection and processing of Customer Controlled Information complies with applicable law. If you are a Customer looking for contractual provisions about how Squarespace will treat and secure your Customer Controlled Information, please see our
Data Processing Addendum
.

Account Information
:

Payments Services Account Information
: If you use the Payments Services (as defined in the
Squarespace Payments Terms)

Payments Services Identity Verification Information
: If you use the Payments Services, you may be required to provide us with additional information to verify your identity, including a photograph of you captured by you during the verification process and a copy of an official government document which includes a different photograph of you. When you’re required to provide this additional information, our vendors may create a biometric scan of your facial geometry based on these two photographs in order to compare them and verify that you are the same individual whose photograph is on your government document. However, Squarespace does not create, store or otherwise have access to any such biometric data. Payments Services Identity Verification Information also includes details that are listed on such official government documents.

3. How we collect your information
We obtain information about you from various sources. We do this in three main ways:
You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account).
We record some of it automatically when you use our Services or, where you are an End User, from your visits to Customers’ sites (including with technologies like cookies).
We receive some of it from third parties (like when you register for an account using a third party service like Apple, Facebook or Google, when you purchase our products from an authorized reseller, when you make payments to us using our payment processor or via a mobile app store or when we receive information about potential enterprise sales leads).
We’ve described this in more detail below.
a. Information you provide
When you use our Services, we collect information from you in a number of ways. For instance, we ask you to provide your Customer Account Details to create and manage your account. We also maintain your Marketing Preferences and your Communication Information that you provide to us. You might also provide us with information in other ways, including by responding to surveys, participating in user research or entering a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion.
Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons. For example:
we may ask you to provide a mailing address and/or select your jurisdiction when you sign up for our paid Services (e.g., purchase a subscription) to determine if, and how much, tax we need to collect from you; or
if you use the Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the
Squarespace Payments Terms
, in order to provide the Payments Services and to comply with our contractual and legal obligations, we collect additional information related to the Payments Services and Processing Services, including Payments Services Account Information and possibly Payments Services Identity Verification Information.
We’ll normally let you know when information is required, and the consequences of failing to provide it. If you do not provide requested information, you may not be able to use our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with the service or if we are legally required to collect it.
b. Information obtained from your use of our Services
When you use our Services, we collect Site Usage Information and Account History Information about your activity on and interaction with the Services. If permission has been granted through your device settings, Site Usage Information for our mobile apps may include your precise location information.
If you are an End User of a Customer’s site, we also get Site Usage Information about your interactions with their sites.
Some of this information is collected automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Services or, if you are an End User, when you visit a Customer’s site. We let our Customers control what cookies and similar technologies are used through their sites (except those we need to use to properly provide the Services, such as for functionality, performance or security related reasons). You can read more about our use of cookies in our
Cookie Policy
. Some of this information is similarly collected automatically through your browser or from your device.
c. Information obtained from other sources
If you use a third party service (such as Apple, Facebook or Google) to register for an account, the third party service may provide us with your Customer Account Details on your behalf, but we don’t collect or store passwords you use to access third party services. We do not control what information a third party service provides to us. The third party service you use may give you options on what the service discloses to us if you link your third party service account with the Services. Make sure you are comfortable with what these third party services share by reviewing their privacy policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the third party service.
If you sign up for our paid Services via a third party service acting as an authorized reseller of our products, the reseller business partner may provide us with information on your behalf which is necessary for us to complete your paid Services sign up, such as your Customer Account Details.
If you use third party services which are integrated with the Services, including financial products, we may receive information about your use of such third party services via our integration business partners.
Currently, our payment processors are Stripe and PayPal. Each payment processor uses and processes your complete payment information in accordance with its applicable privacy policy (
Stripe
and
PayPal
).
If you sign up for paid Services with us using a payment card, we obtain limited information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date.
If you sign up for paid Services with us using PayPal or another non-payment card payment method, we may obtain information about your payment method from our payment processor, such as: (i) for PayPal, the email address associated with your PayPal account; and (ii) for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the last four digits of your bank account number, the country of your bank account and your bank’s bank code and branch code.
The preceding payment processors paragraph is not applicable:
if you sign up for paid Services as an in-app purchase via a mobile app store, in which case the mobile app store’s privacy policy will apply. Please see
Google's privacy policy
and
Apple's privacy policy
for information about how they use and process your payment information.
if you sign up for paid Services via a third party service acting as an authorized reseller of our products. Please see the authorized reseller’s privacy policy for information about how they use and process your payment information.

Vendors:
We disclose information about you to our vendors (including our affiliates) that perform services on our behalf. These include providers of the following types of services:
Customer support vendors
. These vendors assist us in hosting our support offerings (including our support guides and message boards or forums) and helping us track, manage and respond to customer support inquiries. We disclose data such as Customer Account Details and Communication Information to them to enable them to provide these services to us.

6. Your rights and choices
Where applicable law requires (and subject to any relevant exceptions or obligations under law), you may have the right to access, port, update, change or delete personal information.
You may have the right to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information or to exercise a right to data portability under applicable law.
You can access, update, change or delete personal information (or that of your End Users) in your account. You can also delete your account by following the instructions in
this support guide
. Please note that we may need to verify your identity in connection with your requests, and such verification process may, if you do not have access to your account, require you to provide us with additional information we maintain about you to verify your identity. Even if you have access to your account, we may request additional information if we believe it’s necessary to verify your identity. If we are unable to verify your identity or request, we may not, in accordance with applicable law, be able to fulfill your request. You may also contact us by email at
privacy@squarespace.com
to submit a request.
Please note that, for technical reasons, there will likely be a delay in deleting your personal information from our systems when you ask us to delete it.

Additionally, if we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When you do so, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal.

7. How we protect your information
While no service is completely secure, we have a dedicated security team. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are intended to appropriately protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse and any other unlawful form of processing, of the personal information in our possession. We employ security measures such as using firewalls to protect against intruders, building redundancies throughout our network (so that if one server goes down, another can cover for it) and testing for and protecting against network vulnerabilities.
Back to top
8. How we retain your information
We retain your information for as long as your account is active or for as long as needed to provide you with the Services. We also retain your information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, protect us in the event of disputes, enforce our agreements or to protect our or others’ interests.
The precise periods for which we keep your information vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.
As Customers may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an account becomes inactive, if you’re a Customer, we may not immediately delete your information when your trial expires or you cancel all your paid Services. Instead, we keep your information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.
You may delete your account by following the instructions in
this support guide
and/or contacting us at
privacy@squarespace.com
.
Please note that in the course of providing the Services, we may create, collect and/or maintain de-personalized information, which we may retain indefinitely.

9. Data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to countries other than where you live, such as, for example, to our servers in the US. We also store your information locally on the devices you use to access the Services.
Your personal information may be transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. For example, data we store may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances.
We rely upon a number of means to transfer personal information which is subject to European Region data protection laws. These include:
Adequacy decision
. We may, in accordance with Article 45 of the GDPR, transfer personal information to recipients that are in a country that European Commission, UK or Swiss data protection supervisory authority(ies) have confirmed, by decision, offers an adequate level of data protection (“adequacy decision”). We rely on these adequacy decisions to transfer personal information to recipients located in countries such as the UK. The adequacy decisions are available at the following links:
European Commission adequacy decisions

Data Privacy Frameworks
. We transfer personal data to Squarespace, Inc. in the US from, as applicable, the EEA, Switzerland and the UK pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks. An adequacy decision was adopted for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (each individually and jointly, the “Data Privacy Frameworks).
Standard data protection clauses (“SCCs”) and other transfer methods
. For countries without an adequacy decision, we transfer, in accordance with Article 46 of the GDPR, personal information to recipients that have entered into the approved form of transfer contract (SCCs) for the transfer of personal data outside the European Region. We rely on SCCs to transfer personal information to recipients located in countries such as Australia. We may, where there is no adequacy decision, alternatively make a transfer based upon Article 46 of the GDPR using an approved certification mechanism or code of conduct or binding corporate rules.

10. Data Privacy Frameworks
Squarespace, Inc. complies with the Data Privacy Frameworks to provide a legal basis for transfers of personal data to Squarespace, Inc. in the US from, as applicable, the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. Squarespace, Inc. has certified its compliance to the Data Privacy Frameworks.
Squarespace, Inc.’s certification extends to its processing of personal information (received from the European Region under the Data Privacy Frameworks) of the type and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy also describes the types of third parties to which personal information is disclosed (and the purposes for such), individual’s right of access, the choice and means offered to limit the use and disclosure of personal information and that personal information is disclosed in response to legal requests by public authorities where necessary, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Squarespace, Inc. is committed to treating personal information received from the European Region pursuant to the applicable Data Privacy Framework in accordance with the principles thereof (the “DPF Principles”). You can find our certification
here
and you can learn more about the Data Privacy Frameworks (as determined based upon the country from which the personal information was received) and DPF Principles by visiting
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
. For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, Squarespace, Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Our accountability for personal information we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the DPF Principles. In particular, we may use third parties to process data on our behalf as described in this Privacy Policy, and we remain liable if they do so in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
If you have a question or complaint you believe to be within the scope of our Data Privacy Frameworks certification, please contact us first at
privacy@squarespace.com
, or using the contact details in the “How to contact us” section below. Any complaint must include a description of your claim and proof of your relationship with Squarespace. We'll respond within 45 days.
Any complaint that we can’t resolve directly after 45 days may be resolved by JAMS, which is the independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Data Privacy Frameworks compliance. You can contact JAMS free of charge at
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
. JAMS is an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the US.
If your concern still isn't addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under the DPF Principles through the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, which is the international division of the American Arbitration Association (“ICDR-AAA”) and which is the administrator for the Data Privacy Frameworks binding arbitration program. The administration of all such arbitrations will be in accordance with ICDR-AAA’s applicable dispute resolution rules and procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed (the “ICDR-AAA Rules”). If you are in the EEA or the UK, please see the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules
here
. If you are in Switzerland, please see the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules
here
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, both you and Squarespace agree to the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules relating to mass arbitration filings, including without limitation the
ICDR-AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and Fee Schedules
, but excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions.
Any dispute resolution demand or counterclaim, including arbitration demand or counterclaim, asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted and the factual allegations on which those claims are based, and must include proof that the claimant’s data is subject to this Privacy Policy. ICDR-AAA may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. ICDR-AAA has the right to impose sanctions for any claims it determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and any similar standards in other jurisdictions), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant whose data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
Nothing in the Data Privacy Frameworks affects your rights as a data subject to the extent we use any European Commission approved standard data protection clauses for transfers to the US. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and applicable DPF Principles, the applicable DPF Principles shall govern.

Appendix I. Specific Information for California Residents
This Appendix I is only applicable to you if you are a resident of the state of California in the US (“California Residents”) and only applies to Squarespace Controlled Information for which Squarespace is a “Business” (as defined in the CCPA). “CCPA” means the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 - 1798.199), as may be modified from time to time, including by the California Privacy Rights Act. This Appendix I covers Squarespace Controlled Information we collect about California Residents on or through our Services and through other means (such as information collected offline or in person). It does not apply to personal information we collect from individuals in their capacity as job applicants, employees, or independent contractors of Squarespace. As used in this Appendix I, “personal information” shall have the meaning set forth in the CCPA.
If you are a California Resident who is a User and uses the Services to store Customer Controlled Information for which you are a “Business” and Squarespace is a “Service Provider” (as defined in the CCPA), please see our
Data Processing Addendum
for information about how we process Customer Controlled Information.

The only categories of personal information for which we “Share" or “Sell” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising (as described in subsection c. below) are non-directly identifying identifiers (e.g., “hashed” email address), commercial transactions, and Internet activity data.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the parties to whom we disclose or share information, please see
Section 5 above
.
For information on how we retain your personal information, please see
Section 8 above
.
b. Your requests
Subject to certain exceptions and restrictions, the CCPA provides California Residents the right to submit requests to a business which has collected their personal information: (i) to provide them with access to the specific pieces and categories of personal information collected by the business about such California Resident, the categories of sources for such information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting such information, and the categories of unaffiliated parties to whom such information was disclosed; (ii) to request correction of their inaccurate personal information; and (iii) to delete their personal information (each, a “California Request”). We need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete some or all of your information, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.
If you are a California Resident, please follow the instructions in the
“Your rights and choices” section above
to submit California Requests and please make sure you note that you are a California Resident when you do so. California Residents may designate an authorized agent to make California Requests on their behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a California Request on your behalf, you or your agent must provide proof that the agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf, such as written authorization signed by you authorizing that agent to act on your behalf. We reserve the right to request additional information from you and/or individuals purporting to be authorized agents, such as when we suspect fraud.
c. Do not sell or share my personal information
California residents may opt out of the "Sale" or “Sharing” of their personal information. The CCPA’s definition of "Sale" includes “Sharing” for purposes of “cross-context behavioral advertising,” which is defined as targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites. We only mean this CCPA definition when “share” or “sharing” are capitalized in this Appendix I or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. We Share information to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services. Depending on how you use the Services, we may Share device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies, for such purposes. We do not otherwise “Sell” (as defined in the CCPA) your personal information, and have not engaged in such activity in the twelve (12) months prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy.
If you would like to opt out of Squarespace's Sale or Sharing of your information with third parties for such purposes, you may do so by clicking on the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of this page. Please note that the opt out will only apply to the browser and device you use to opt out.
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. We collect the following categories of “sensitive personal information”: (i) account log-in and password or other credentials that allow access to your account; and (ii) geolocation information. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.
We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the “Global Privacy Control,” which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your personal information for online behavioral advertising purposes. We respond to the Global Privacy Control in California. To opt out of Sale or Sharing, turn on the Global Privacy Control signal in your browser. Please note that the opt out will only apply to the browser and device you use to send the Global Privacy Control signal.
We do not knowingly Sell or Share the personal information of children under 16.
d. We do not discriminate against you
You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Squarespace does not discriminate against California Residents for exercising their rights.

Appendix II. Specific Information for Residents of Other US States With An Applicable Data Privacy Law
This Appendix II is only applicable to you if you are a resident of a state other than California with an applicable data privacy law such as Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, and Texas (“Applicable State Residents”) and only applies to Squarespace Controlled Information for which Squarespace is a “Controller” (as defined in an applicable state data privacy law). It does not apply to personal information we collect about you where you are acting as an employee, owner, director, officer or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit or government agency. This Appendix II applies to personal information we collect about Applicable State Residents on or through our Services and through other means (such as information collected offline or in person).

Section 6 above
, you can:

Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable state data privacy law. Depending on where you live, if we deny your request to exercise your rights in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, you may contact us at
privacy@squarespace.com
with the subject “Data Privacy Request Appeal” to provide us with details about why you are appealing the decision.
Residents of the state of Colorado may review the table in
Appendix I(a) above
