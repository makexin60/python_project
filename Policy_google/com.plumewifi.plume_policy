13. PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES IN SPECIFIC JURISDICTIONS
1. WHEN AND WHERE DOES THIS PLUME PRIVACY POLICY APPLY?
When the Plume Privacy Policy applies depends on your relationship with Plume.
o The Plume Privacy Policy applies when you are asked to acknowledge it and when Plume is the controller of your personal information. In this Plume Privacy Policy, the term “controller” means the entity that is responsible for the purpose and means of processing your personal information. For example:
▪ When you create an account to use HomePass or WorkPass, you may be asked to acknowledge that this Plume Privacy Policy applies to your personal information, which Plume processes as a controller.
▪ Plume processes your personal information as a controller when Plume collects data (including personal information) for service management purposes, such as to identify and track and record support, to ensure the security and integrity of the Plume Services and for billing and account management.
▪ Plume is the controller of Services Data and uses Services Data to analyze, measure the effectiveness of and improve the Plume Services.
▪ When you visit
www.plume.com
to learn more about Plume or download resources, Plume is the controller. Plume.com is operated by Plume Design, Inc. as responsible controller.
o When a business Customer asks you to agree to that business Customer’s privacy policy before you connect to a Customer Network, then the business Customer’s privacy policy applies. Generally, Plume is a processor of personal information when a business Customer’s privacy policy applies – except for data collected for services management purposes and Services Data when Plume is the controller.
o If a particular website or service links to a different privacy policy, then that privacy policy – not the Plume Privacy Policy – applies. Please make sure to check those other privacy policies to learn how your personal information is processed.
2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES PLUME COLLECT AND WHY?

Plume shares personal information with the following categories of recipients:
∙ Professional advisors, such as lawyers, accountants, insurers and information security and forensics experts.
∙ Marketing vendors that help promote the Plume Services (such as by email marketing) and to supplement personal information that we already have. For example, Meta receives and uses certain data related to the use of the Services to help us deliver personalized advertising on its platform and assess the effectiveness of this advertising.

∙ Business partners, such as the providers of the Internet-connected devices and services that a Customer chooses to connect to a Customer Network (e.g., Google Nest and Amazon Alexa). If you acquire the Plume Services through a CSP or other Internet service provider, Plume shares personal information with that provider. Plume also shares personal information with partners to enable them to segment their customers who are Users based on machine learning-determined “traits” of that location.
∙ Potential or actual acquirers or investors and their professional advisers in connection with any actual or proposed merger, acquisition or investment in or of all or any part of our business. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the terms of this Plume Privacy Policy apply to personal information after the transaction or that Users receive advance notice of changes to personal information processing.
∙ Our subsidiaries/branch offices in Slovenia, Switzerland and Taiwan (
Plume Entities
).
∙ Competent law enforcement, government regulators and courts when we believe disclosure is necessary (i) to comply with the law, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend legal rights, or (iii) to protect the vital interests of Users, business partners, service providers or another third party.
∙ Other third parties with consent.
When Plume shares anonymized data, Plume takes administrative measures to prohibit efforts by recipients to attempt to re-identify anonymized data.
6. HOW DOES PLUME PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Plume uses technical, physical, and administrative safeguards intended to protect the personal information that we process from unauthorized access and use.
Our safeguards are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and include (as applicable) measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and a procedure for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing of personal information. Like any other organization, Plume cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the processing of personal information.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. Plume will treat access to the Plume Services through your account credentials as authorized by you.
We may suspend your use of all or part of the Plume Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that information you provided to Plume or your account is no longer secure, please notify us immediately at
privacy@plume.com
.

7. HOW LONG DOES PLUME RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Plume retains personal information associated with a Customer’s account for as long as the account is active and as required by Plume’s Customer contracts and otherwise for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes described above. Plume also retains personal information for as long as Plume believes necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements.
When determining the relevant retention period, Plume takes into account the Plume Services used, the nature and length of Plume’s relationship with the Customer, mandatory retention periods provided by law and other relevant criteria.
At the end of the relevant retention period, Plume either deletes or anonymizes personal information or, if Plume cannot delete or anonymize the personal information, then Plume segregates and securely stores personal information until deletion or anonymization is possible. Plume anonymizes and then uses anonymized data subject to applicable law and contracts.
8. WHAT CHOICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Device Names: A Customer Network’s administrator may assign profiles and nicknames to Customer Network Equipment, computers and Mobile Devices connected to a Customer Network.

Security settings: A Customer Network’s administrator may configure policies for security protection, schedules or content filters through the account settings.
Account Deactivation:
You can deactivate your Plume account through the Mobile App (for HomePass) or through the Plume website and by contacting Customer Support (for other Plume Services).
Mobile Device Tools:
Mobile operating systems and mobile app platforms (e.g., Google Play, App Store) have permission settings for specific types of mobile device data and notifications, such as for access to contacts, geo-location services and so-called push notifications. You can use the settings on your Mobile Device to consent to or deny certain information collection and/or push notifications. You can stop all information collection from a Plume Mobile App by uninstalling it. If you uninstall a Plume Mobile App, please also consider checking your operating system’s settings to confirm that the unique identifier and other activity associated with your use of the Plume Mobile App is deleted from your Mobile Device.
Other rights and choices about your personal information depend on your place of habitual residence and the applicable Plume Services. Please see Section 13 for more information.

Plume transfers personal information within the EU and to the UK and U.S. and to our customer service vendor in Egypt.
If your personal information is transferred across borders by Plume or on Plume’s behalf, Plume uses appropriate safeguards to protect personal information in accordance with this Plume Privacy Policy.

VI. WHAT PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE AVAILABLE AND HOW CAN YOU EXERCISE THEM?
1.Privacy Rights
Subject to our verification requirements, Plume provides Consumers with the privacy rights described in this section VI. For residents of states without privacy rights, Plume will consider requests but will determine in its sole discretion how to process those requests.
To submit a privacy rights request or to submit a request as an authorized agent, use Plume’s
Privacy Rights Request Form
or email us at
privacy@plume.com
. You also may call us at 844-MY PLUME (844-697-5863). Plume does not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax).
(a) Right to Access/Know
Residents of California, Virginia, Colorado and Texas are entitled to access personal information up to twice per 12-month period. Residents of Connecticut, Utah, Montana and Oregon are entitled once every 12-month period to access personal information maintained by Plume. Plume may choose to provide you with access to personal information more often but a service fee may apply to these subsequent requests. When possible, we will provide a copy of this information in a portable, and to the extent feasible, readily usable format.
(1) Categories of Personal Information
California residents have a right to submit a request for any of the following for the 12-month period prior to the request date:
The categories of personal information we collect from or about you or otherwise process.
The categories of sources from which your personal information was collected.
Plume’s business purposes or commercial purposes for collecting and (if applicable) selling or sharing your personal information.
The categories of third parties to which Plume disclosed your personal information.
A list of the categories of personal information disclosed for a Business Purpose and, for each, the categories of recipients or that no disclosure occurred.
A list of the categories of personal information Sold or Shared (each as defined below) about you and, for each, the categories of recipients or that no Sale or Share occurred.
Oregon residents have a right to submit a request for the categories of personal information we are Processing or have processed
(2) Specific Pieces of Personal Information
California residents may request to confirm if we are Processing your personal information and, if we are, to obtain a transportable copy (subject to applicable request limits) of your personal information that we have collected and are maintaining. For your specific pieces of personal information, as required by CCPA, Plume will apply the heightened verification standards as described below. We have no obligation to re-identify information or to keep personal information longer than we need it or are required to by applicable law to comply with access requests.
(b) Right to Delete
You may request that Plume delete your personal information unless Plume has a basis for retaining it under applicable law. Depending on where you reside (e.g., California or Utah), Plume may not have the obligation to delete your personal information that we did not collect directly from you.
(c) Right to Correct Personal Information
You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies that you find in the personal information about you maintained by us. You also can make certain changes to your online account (e.g., name and password) in the account settings section of the account. Changing your account settings will not, however, change your personal information that exists in other places.
(d) Right to Obtain a List of Third-Party Recipients
Oregon residents have a right to request a list of specific third parties, other than natural persons, to which we have disclosed your personal information, or any Oregon residents’ personal information (at our option).
(e) Do Not Sell / Share / Target
U.S. Privacy Laws have broad and differing concepts of Selling personal information for which an opt-out is required. California also has an opt-out from Sharing for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising (i.e., use of personal information from different businesses or services to target advertisements). Other states have an opt-out of Targeted Advertising (defined differently but also addressing tracking, profiling and targeting of advertisements). Plume may Sell or Share your personal information and/or use your personal information for Targeted Advertising, as these terms apply under U.S. Privacy Laws. Plume does, however, provide Consumers an opt out of Sale/Sharing/Targeting that is intended to combine these state opt-outs into a single opt-out available regardless of state of residency. To opt out of Sale/Sharing/Targeting, please visit Plume’s U.S.
Privacy Request Form
Third-party digital businesses may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that collect personal information about you on the Plume Services or otherwise collect and process personal information that we make available about you, including digital activity information. We understand that giving access to personal information on the Plume Services or otherwise to a third-party digital business could be deemed a Sale and/or Share under some U.S. Privacy Laws. Plume will treat that personal information (e.g., cookie ID, IP address and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) collected by a third-party digital business, which is not limited to acting as our Service Provider (or Contractor or Processor) as a Sale and/or Share and subject to a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request. We will not Sell your personal information, Share your personal information for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising or process your personal information for Targeted Advertising if you make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt out request.
Opt-out for non-cookie personal information:
If you want to limit our processing of your non-cookie personal information (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request as described below.
Opt-out for cookie personal information:
If you want to limit our Processing of your cookie-related personal information for Targeted Advertising or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of that personal information, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool by clicking on the “Cookies” link in the footer of
www.plume.com
. This is because we use different technologies to apply preferences for opting out of cookie personal information vs. non-cookie personal information. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your browser / device. You must exercise your preferences on the Plume Services that you use and from each browser you use and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences are no longer effective and you must enable them again by clicking on the “Cookies” link in the footer of
www.plume.com
. If you use ad blocking software, our cookie banner may not appear when you visit the Plume Services and you may need to use the link above to access the cookie preference tools.
We do not knowingly Sell or Share the personal information of Consumers under age 16, unless we receive affirmative (opt-in) authorization from either the Consumer who is between age 13 and 16 or the parent or guardian of a Consumer who is less than 13 years old. If you think Plume may have unknowingly collected personal information of a Consumer under age 16, please contact us using the information in
How to Contact Plume
.
Plume may disclose your personal information for the following purposes (which are not a Sale or Share): (i) if you direct Plume to disclose personal information; (ii) to comply with any Consumer rights request you submit to Plume; (iii) disclosures among the entities that constitute Plume or as part of a corporate transaction; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.
(f) Right to Limit Sensitive Personal Information Processing (if/when applicable)
Plume does not require that you provide sensitive personal information (as defined in U.S. Privacy Laws) to use the Plume Services. If you provide us with sensitive personal information, you have consented to Plume’s processing of the sensitive personal information for the purpose for which you provided it. You may also have certain privacy rights related to your sensitive personal information. Please contact us at
privacy@plume.com
.
(g) Automated Decision Making/Profiling (if/when applicable)
If Plume engages in processing that may constitute Automated Decision Making or Profiling under U.S. Privacy Laws, you have the right to opt-out of certain types of Automated Decision Making or Profiling processing. Currently, Plume does not engage in these activities.
2.How to Exercise Privacy Rights
To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights or to submit a request as an authorized agent, visit Plume’s U.S.
Privacy Request Form
, call us at 844-MY PLUME (844-697-5863) or email us at
privacy@plume.com
. Please check for and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax).
3.Verification of Privacy Rights Requests
We may ask you to provide verifying information, such as your name, email, telephone number and/or account information, before we act on your request. We will review the information provided and may request additional information. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces), Right to Delete or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal information. We do not verify opt-outs of Sell/Share/Target or Limitation of Sensitive personal information requests unless we suspect fraud.
We verify each request as follows:
Right to Access/Know (Categories)
: We verify your Request to Access/Know categories of personal information to a reasonable degree of certainty. If we cannot do so, we will refer you to this Notice for a general description of our privacy practices.
Right to Access/Know Specific Pieces)
: We verify your Request To Access/Know specific pieces of personal information to a reasonably high degree of certainty. If you fail to provide requested information, we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request, but we will then treat it as a Right to Know Categories Request if you are a California resident.
Right to Obtain a List of Third-Party Recipients
: We verify your Request to Obtain a List of Third-Party Recipients to a reasonable degree of certainty. If we cannot do so, we will request additional information from you, and refer you to this Notice for a general description of our privacy practices.
Do Not Sell/Share/Target
: No specific verification required unless we suspect fraud.
Right to Delete
: We verify your Request to Delete to a reasonable degree of certainty or to a reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized deletion. If we cannot verify you sufficiently to honor a deletion request, you can still make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request.
Correction
: We verify your Request to Correct Personal Information to a reasonable degree of certainty depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and the risk of harm for unauthorized correction.
To protect Consumers, if we are unable to verify a privacy rights request, we are unable to honor the request. We will use personal information provided in a verified privacy rights request only to verify identity or authority to make the privacy rights request and to track and document responses unless Plume also received the personal information for another purpose.
4.Agent Requests
You may use an authorized agent to make a privacy rights request for you. Before you can authorize an agent, Plume requires that you complete and submit this
Authorized Agent Authorization Form
or call us at 844-MY PLUME (844-697-5863). We also may require you directly confirm that you authorized the agent to submit the request. Once confirmed, your Authorized Agent may exercise privacy rights on your behalf, subject to the requirements of applicable law.
5.Appeals
You may appeal Plume’s decision regarding a request by email at
legal@plume.com
. Please use the same email address that you used to submit the initial privacy rights request to submit your Request to Appeal and please add “Request to Appeal” in the subject line of the email. If you do not use the same email address, Plume cannot link your Request to Appeal to your initial privacy rights request.
6.Plume’s Responses
Some personal information that we maintain is insufficiently specific for us to be able to associate it with a verified Consumer (e.g., data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that personal information in response to those requests. If we deny a request, in whole or in part, Plume will explain the reasons in our response.
Plume will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify personal information that we process to respond to a privacy rights request. In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest you receive the most recent or a summary of your personal information and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest. We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive personal information yourself. We will typically do not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.
VII. WHAT ELSE DO CONSUMERS NEED TO KNOW?
1. Non-Discrimination / Non-Retaliation
Plume will not discriminate or retaliate against you in a manner prohibited by applicable U.S. Privacy Laws for your exercise of your Consumer privacy rights. We may charge a different price or rate or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable personal information.
2. Notice of Financial Incentive Programs
Plume does not currently offer discounts or other rewards to Consumers in exchange for personal information. If we do in the future offer these types of incentives, we will provide notice and obtain consent as required by applicable law.
3. Our Rights and the Rights of Others
Plume may collect, use and disclose your personal information as required or permitted by applicable law, which may override your rights under U.S. Privacy Laws. Plume is not required to honor requests if doing so would infringe Plume’s or another party’s rights or conflict with applicable law.
4. California Shine the Light Law
Plume does not share “personal information,” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law, with third parties for those third parties own direct marketing purposes. California residents may opt-out of this sharing by contacting us at
privacy@plume.com
or 325 Lytton Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301 (Attn: Privacy).
Please add the statement “Shine the Light Request” in the subject line and in the body of your correspondence. Please also attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. This right is available in addition to CCPA rights and requires a separate request. The Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out is broader and will limit our sharing with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without the need for making a separate Shine the Light request.
Plume will not accept Shine the Light Requests by telephone or by fax and is not responsible for Shine the Light Requests not properly labeled or sent or that are incomplete.
VII. HOW TO CONTACT PLUME

This DPF Policy applies to Personal Information transferred from member countries of the European Economic Area (

UK
), and Switzerland to Plume in the U.S. in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF or the Swiss-U.S. DPF.
Personal Information that Plume Processes in compliance with the DPF Program is covered by Plume’s other privacy-related requirements and policies (collectively, the
Plume Privacy Policy
), available at

. For some of Plume’s websites or mobile applications, if a separate privacy policy, notice or statement is linked or posted, that privacy policy, notice or statement applies.
Plume is an Agent as to certain Processing for its customers and a Controller as to other Processing for its customers as described in the Plume Privacy Policy.

.
This DPF Policy does
not
apply to Personal Information transferred under Standard Contractual Clauses or any approved derogation from the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the UK General Data Protection Regulation or the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act. While the DPF Program is an authorized international transfer mechanism to enable Plume to receive Data Subjects’ Personal Information in the U.S., Plume’s obligations and Data Subject rights under the DPF Program are separate from those under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the UK General Data Protection Regulation and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act.
PLUME’S COMMITMENT TO THE DPF PRINCIPLES
Plume commits to applying the DPF Principles to all Personal Information received by Plume in the U.S. from the EEA, UK and Switzerland in reliance on the DPF Program. Plume’s adherence to this DPF Policy may be limited to the extent required to meet Plume’s legal, regulatory, governmental or national security obligations.

Notice
; 2.
Choice
; 3.
Accountability for Onward Transfer
; 4.
Security
; 5.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
; 6.
Access
; and 7.
Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.
1.
Notice Principle
Plume provides notice to Data Subjects about its Processing practices for Personal Information received by Plume in the U.S. from the EEA, UK and Switzerland in reliance on the DPF Program through the Plume Privacy Policy and this DPF Policy, including:
the types of Personal Information it collects about them
the purposes for which it Processes the Personal Information (see also 5. below)
the types of Agents and other third parties to which Plume discloses Personal Information and the purposes for doing so (see also 3. below)
the rights of Data Subjects to access their Personal Information (see 6. below)
the choices that Plume offers Data Subjects for limiting use and disclosure of their Personal Information (see also 2. below)
how Plume’s obligations under the DPF Program are enforced, including Plume’s designated independent dispute resolution mechanism to address complaints and provide appropriate recourse free of charge, the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration (see also 7. below)
Plume’s liability in cases of onward transfers to third parties (see also section 3. below)
how Data Subjects can contact Plume with questions or complaints.
Plume is not required to apply the Notice Principle or the Choice or Accountability for Onward Transfer Principles (see 2. and 3. below) to public record information (i.e., records kept by government agencies or entities at any level that are open to consultation by the public in general) or information that is already publicly available to the public at large if this information is not combined with
non
-public record information and, for public record information, and any conditions for consultation established by the relevant jurisdiction are respected.
2.
Choice Principle
Plume provides Data Subjects with choices about their Personal Information before Plume uses Personal Information covered by this DPF Policy for a new purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which the Personal Information was originally collected or subsequently authorized or before disclosure to a non-Agent third party that was not already authorized.
Plume will obtain affirmative consent (i.e., opt-in) from Data Subjects before Sensitive Personal Information is disclosed to a third party.
Plume will obtain the Data Subject’s affirmative express consent (i.e., opt in) before Sensitive Personal Information covered by this DPF Policy is (i) disclosed to a third party or (ii) used for a new purpose that is different from that for which the Personal Information was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the Data Subject (subject to some limitations set forth
here
). Under the DPF Principles, Plume is not required to provide choice when disclosure is made to a third party that is acting as an Agent if Plume enters into a written contract with the Agent (see 3. below).
To opt out of these uses or disclosures of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, please contact Plume as follows:
Send an email to
privacy@plume.com
Complete the form available
here
(in English) (For other languages:
https://www.plume.com/legal/
).
Plume may engage with a Data Subject to request sufficient information to allow Plume to confirm the identity of the Data Subject making an opt-out request. Plume may use Personal Information for certain direct marketing purposes when it is impracticable for Plume to provide a Data Subject with an opportunity to opt out before using the Personal Information. Plume will promptly offer the Data Subject the opportunity at the same time (and upon request at any time) to decline (at no cost) to receive any further direct marketing communications and Plume complies with the individual’s wishes.
3.
Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle
Plume offers Data Subjects the opportunity to choose (i.e., opt out) whether their Personal Information is (i) disclosed to a third party or (ii) used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which the Personal Information was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
Transfers to Controllers
: Plume will transfer Personal Information covered by this DPF Policy to a third party acting as a Controller consistent with the relevant Plume Privacy Policies provided to each affected Data Subject and the Data Subject’s consent given to Plume.
Plume will make these transfers only if the Controller has agreed in a written contract that it will (i) Process the Personal Information for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the Data Subjects, (ii) provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the DPF Principles and notify us if it makes a determination that it cannot do so; and (iii) cease Processing of the Personal Information or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate the Processing if it makes such a determination.
Plume will take reasonable and appropriate steps to prevent, stop or remediate the Processing if Plume becomes aware that a Controller is Processing Personal Information covered by this DPF Policy contrary to the DPF Principles.
Transfers to Agents
: Plume will transfer to each Agent only the Personal Information needed for the Agent to provide the services or products as Plume has instructed.
Plume will require that each Agent:
Process the Personal Information only for limited and specified purposes as instructed by Plume;
Provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the DPF Principles;
Take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the Agent effectively Processes the Personal Information transferred in a manner compliant with Plume’s obligations under the DPF Principles; and
Notify Plume if the Agent determines that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the DPF Principles.
Upon receiving notification from an Agent that the Agent can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the DPF Principles, Plume will take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate the unauthorized Processing. Plume also provides summaries of the relevant privacy provisions of its contracts with Agents to the Department of Commerce upon request.
In certain situations, Plume may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Plume remains liable under the DPF Principles if an Agent Processes Personal Information covered by this DPF Policy in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles unless Plume proves that Plume is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damages.
4.
Security Principle
Plume takes reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information covered by this DPF Policy from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, considering the risks involved in the Processing and the nature of the Personal Information.
5.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation Principle
Plume limits its collection of Personal Information to information that is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Plume does not Process Personal Information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the Data Subject.
Plume takes reasonable steps to ensure that such Personal Information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. Plume takes reasonable and appropriate measures to comply with the requirement under the DPF Program to retain Personal Information in identifiable form only for as long as it serves a purpose of Processing. Specifically, Plume will retain Personal Information in accordance with Plume’s legitimate business purposes and legal obligations, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
Plume will adhere to the DPF Principles for as long as it retains Personal Information covered by this DPF Policy.
6.
Access Principle
Data Subjects whose Personal Information is covered by this DPF Policy have the right (i) to obtain from Plume confirmation of whether or not Plume is Processing Personal Information relating to them and to access that Personal Information and (ii) to correct, amend, or delete their Personal Information if it is inaccurate or if Plume Processes it in violation of the DPF Principles - except when the burden or expense of providing access, correction, amendment, or deletion would be disproportionate to the risks to the Data Subject’s privacy, when the rights of persons other than the Data Subject would be violated or when disclosure is likely to interfere with the safeguarding of important countervailing public interests, such as national security, national defense or public security.
Plume will make good-faith, reasonable and practical efforts to comply with requests, so long as our doing so would be consistent with applicable law and/or Plume’s contractual requirements.
Plume may engage with a Data Subject to request sufficient information to allow Plume to confirm the Data Subject’s identity or if an access request is vague or broad in scope or to better understand the motivation for the request and to locate responsive information. Plume also may inquire about how the Data Subject interacted with Plume or about the nature of the Personal Information or its use that is the subject of the request. Plume may deny or limit access to the extent that granting full access would reveal Plume’s own proprietary or confidential commercial information, such as the confidential commercial information of another that is subject to a contractual obligation of confidentiality. Plume may set reasonable limits on the number of times within a given period that access requests from a particular Data Subject will be met.
To make a data access request, Data Subjects may contact Plume by:
Sending an email to
privacy@plume.com
Completing the form available
here
(For other languages:
https://www.plume.com/legal/
).
Plume will respond to access requests within a reasonable time.
7.
Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability
The Federal Trade Commission (
FTC
) has
jurisdiction
over Plume’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Plume commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of Personal Information transferred to the U.S. pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF.
EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints should first contact Plume by email to
privacy@plume.com
.
Plume has further committed to refer unresolved DPF Principles-related complaints to a U.S.-based independent dispute resolution mechanism, BBB NATIONAL PROGRAMS. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
www.bbbprograms.org/dpf-complaints
for more information and to file a complaint. The service of BBB NATIONAL PROGRAMS is provided free of charge to you.
If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.
See
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction
for information. (Note that
Paragraph C
of Annex I of the DPF Principles explains the Pre-Arbitration Requirements.)
* * * * *
Plume agrees to periodically review and verify its compliance with the DPF Principles and to remedy any issues arising out of Plume’s failure to comply with the DPF Principles. Plume acknowledges that its failure to provide an annual self-certification to the U.S. Department of Commerce will remove it from the Department’s list of DPF participants.
All Plume personnel who have access in the U.S. to Personal Information covered by this DPF Policy are responsible for ensuring that Personal Information Processing complies with this DPF Policy. Plume personnel are also responsible for ensuring that Agents or other unaffiliated third parties that Process Personal Information subject to this DPF Policy comply with this DPF Policy and Process Personal Information in accordance with the DPF Principles, including contracts required by the DPF Program.
CHANGES TO THIS DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK POLICY
This DPF Policy may be amended from time to time consistent with the requirements of the DPF. When we make changes to this DPF Policy, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of this DPF Policy. We will also take appropriate measures to inform you in advance of changes we feel are significant so that you have an opportunity to review the revised DPF Policy before it is effective. If your consent is required by the DPF Principles, we will obtain your consent. We encourage you to regularly check this DPF Policy to ensure you are aware of the updated version.
