​​How We Protect Your Information
We understand the importance of keeping your information safe and secure, and will make commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from any loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
We take necessary and appropriate measures to securely manage your information by allowing only minimal and limited access to files containing your information. In addition, we ensure the security of our systems through the use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and other equivalent encryption technologies whenever we transmit sensitive information collected from you.
Although we take reasonable precautions, we cannot guarantee that your information will never be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards on our Services, databases, equipment or servers. Accordingly, we cannot assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized access to our servers and systems beyond our control and thus, strongly urge you to take reasonable measures at all times to protect your own personal information.
​​Requests for Review, Correction
If you wish to review, correct or delete the information you have previously provided us, you may submit a request by contacting us using the inquiry form on our website or app or by email.
Upon receipt of your request and verification of your identity, we will take appropriate steps to respond to your request to the extent we deem reasonable. However, we may not always be able to accommodate your request if we are not required to do so under applicable laws or regulations, if the same request is repeatedly submitted without justifiable grounds, or if your request requires excessively technical work.
​​Requests for Account Deletion
Upon deletion of your game account, restoration will no longer be possible. Except as otherwise required by applicable laws, regulations, or the terms of this Agreement, all personal information associated with the account will be permanently deleted or rendered anonymized. Additionally, any products or services previously linked to the account will cease to be associated with it. Please review this decision carefully and ensure you fully understand the consequences before proceeding with the account deletion process.
Mandatory conditions for game account deletion
Prior to submitting a request to the Company for the cancellation of your game account, and to ensure the effective protection of your rights, interests, and account security, you must confirm that the account in question satisfies all of the following conditions, including but not limited to:
Legal Ownership and Compliance: The account is lawfully owned and operated by you and complies with all applicable specifications and requirements set forth by the Company.
Security and Risk-Free Status: The account is free from any security risks, such as, but not limited to, disputes concerning ownership, restrictions or blocks imposed on the account, reports, investigations initiated by national authorities, or any ongoing arbitration or litigation.
Management of Stored Assets or Earnings: Any assets or earnings associated with the account—including, but not limited to, coupons, diamonds, gold coins, items, experience cards, membership privileges, or other entitlements—must be managed appropriately. Any such assets or earnings remaining in the account upon cancellation will be deemed voluntarily relinquished by you.
Fulfillment of Transactions: The account does not have any pending or unfulfilled orders or transactions, including, but not limited to, top-up payments, gold ingots, diamonds, gold coins, or items.
Dissociation from Special Identities: The account must be dissociated from any special identities, roles, or affiliations (where applicable), such as memberships or leadership roles in an Alliance.
Cancellation of Auto-Renewal: If the account has an active auto-renewal service, you must ensure that the auto-renewal feature has been canceled prior to initiating the account cancellation request.
Compliance with Additional Conditions: Any other conditions specified by the Company as necessary for account cancellation must also be satisfied.
You are responsible for verifying and confirming that all of the aforementioned conditions have been satisfied prior to proceeding. If you are unable to complete this verification independently or have any questions during the process, you may contact the Company’s customer support for further assistance.
The game account deletion process
To initiate the account deletion process, you must submit your request via the support email at contact@pyro.asia and follow the procedures and operational guidelines provided by the Company.
Upon receiving your account deletion request, the Company reserves the right to evaluate whether your account satisfies the conditions for deletion. This evaluation will take into account factors such as the security status of the account and its usage history. To safeguard your account security and property rights, the Company also reserves the right to verify your identity to confirm that you are the legitimate owner of the account. If, based on a comprehensive review, the account is determined not to meet the conditions for deletion, or if identity verification is unsuccessful, your deletion request may be denied.
You acknowledge and agree that the Company’s verification of whether your account meets the deletion requirements is conducted as a formal review process only. It remains your responsibility to ensure that all conditions for deletion are met. You further accept any and all consequences resulting from this process, and the Company will not assume legal liability for such outcomes.
Once your identity has been verified, you have reviewed all applicable notices and reminders, and you have clicked “Confirm Deletion,” your account deletion application will be deemed officially submitted. Following submission, the Company will provide a 15-day retention period (the "cooling-off period") for your account. During this cooling-off period, the Company will not delete or anonymize any account-related information unless required by applicable laws, regulations, or relevant policies. You will not have access to the game or related services during this time to ensure completion of the account deletion process.
If you decide to continue using the Company’s game services, you must withdraw your deletion application before the cooling-off period expires. If the Company does not receive a withdrawal request by the end of the cooling-off period, and there are no other grounds for rejecting your application, the account will be permanently deleted. Once deleted, the account cannot be restored under any circumstances.
​​Special Note about Children
We may allow persons under the age of 18 to register to use the Services and collect personally identifiable information from such users, if the express consent of their parent or guardian is obtained.
When we confirm that a user under the age of 18 has registered to use the Services or has submitted any personally identifiable information to us, we will, in accordance with applicable laws or regulations or at our discretion, request a parent or guardian's e-mail address to notify them of the activity of the user. We take appropriate steps to ensure that parental/guardian consent is obtained for our collection, use and sharing of children's personal information.
If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 18 without verification of parental/guardian consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
Please contact us using our inquiry form on our website or app or by email if you believe that we might have obtained any information from or about a child under the age of 18 without parental/guardian consent, or if you wish to review, correct or delete your child’s information previously provided to us with your consent.
If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which their parents or guardians have previously consented, we will notify them to obtain additional consent.
​​Changes to This Policy
We use commercially reasonable efforts to continuously review and improve our handling of your information, and may update this Policy from time to time as necessary.
We will notify you of any material revisions to this Policy by posting on our website or through other conspicuous means of notification. Changes to this Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. However, if we are required by applicable laws or regulations to obtain your consent before we make certain revisions, then we will take appropriate steps to comply with such laws or regulations accordingly.
