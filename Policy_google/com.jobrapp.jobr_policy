Resume Visibility and Security
: Some of our products and services, such as our resume and profile databases, and social media search enable third parties to see your personal data and to contact you.
Information you post in public areas of Monster sites or applications or make visible in the resume and profile database may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world
, including those in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal data as defined by your country of residence. While Monster takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use, Monster does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of information you post.
When you create or post a resume, we store it in our resume and profile databases in the United States. You may control the visibility of your resume on Monster by setting it to:
Visible,
Confidential, or
Private.
Visible and confidential resumes can be viewed by anyone with access to our resume and profile database. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes that have been viewed or downloaded by others.

andselecting visibility settings. Private resumes will not be visible in Monster's resume and profile database. You may still use your private resume to apply online to a job.If you apply with a private resume, it will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy of it.
If you apply for a job and provide your contact information to express interest in a job, or if you respond to a communication from an employer, you agree that your information will be shared with the relevant employer and that you will be contacted by that employer for employment-related purposes.
We attempt to limit access to our resume and profile databases to legitimate users but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to these databases.Once your resume has been disclosed, Monster is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who accessed it. Accordingly,
you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public in your resume or profile.
If your resume includes the personal data of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have provided their details and that person has consented for you to do so.
You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret.
The security of your personal data is important to us. We utilize a variety of safeguards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. Monster takes appropriate measures to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure.

Monster does not make decisions based solely on automated processing.
RETENTION PERIOD AND RESUME VISIBILITY/SECURITY
Monster will retain your personal information for five (5) years after the last time you interact with our services at which time it will be automatically deleted from our systems unless we are legally required to keep it longer.

Resume Visibility and Security
: Some of our products and services, such as our resume and profile databases, and social media search enable third parties to see your personal data and to contact you.
Information you post in public areas of Monster sites or applications or make visible in the resume and profile database may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world
, including those in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal data as defined by your country of residence. While Monster takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use, Monster does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of information you post.
When you create or post a resume, we store it in our resume and profile databases in the United States. You may control the visibility of your resume on Monster by setting it to:
Visible,
Confidential, or
Private.
Visible and confidential resumes can be viewed by anyone with access to our resume and profile database. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes that have been viewed or downloaded by others.
You should not post sensitive information about yourself, for example gender, marital status, health data, or any other information you would not want made public, such as your address or phone number, to any Monster site or application or to any public website
. You may adjust your visibility settings at any time by
signing into your Monster account
andselecting visibility settings. Private resumes will not be visible in Monster's resume and profile database. You may still use your private resume to apply online to a job.If you apply with a private resume, it will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy of it.
If you apply for a job and provide your contact information to express interest in a job, or if you respond to a communication from an employer, you agree that your information will be shared with the relevant employer and that you will be contacted by that employer for employment-related purposes.
We attempt to limit access to our resume and profile databases to legitimate users but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to these databases.Once your resume has been disclosed, Monster is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who accessed it. Accordingly,
you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public in your resume or profile.
If your resume includes the personal data of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have provided their details and that person has consented for you to do so.
You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret.
The security of your personal data is important to us. We utilize a variety of safeguards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. Monster takes appropriate measures to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. You can find additional information on conducting a safe job search in our
Security Center

Automated Processing
Monster may perform automated processing of your Personal Information to analyze and predict your preferences and interests. In some circumstances, automated processing is necessary for us to provide our services to job seekers and employers. For example, automated processing allows us to match job seekers with employers effectively, to provide job seekers with job alerts and recommended jobs, to send job seeker applications to employers, to display search results, administer employer questions, and to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users. Monster does not make decisions based solely on automated processing.
RETENTION PERIOD AND RESUME VISIBILITY/SECURITY
Monster will retain your personal information for five (5) years after the last time you interact with our services at which time it will be automatically deleted from our systems unless we are legally required to keep it longer.
You may request that Monster delete your data at any time by submitting a
Personal Data Request

Resume Visibility and Security
: Some of our products and services, such as our resume and profile databases, and social media search enable third parties to see your personal data and to contact you.
Information you post in public areas of Monster sites or applications or make visible in the resume and profile database may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world
, including those in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal data as defined by your country of residence. While Monster takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use, Monster does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of information you post.
When you create or post a resume, we store it in our resume and profile databases in the United States. You may control the visibility of your resume on Monster by setting it to:
Visible,
Confidential, or
Private.
Visible and confidential resumes can be viewed by anyone with access to our resume and profile database. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes that have been viewed or downloaded by others.
You should not post sensitive information about yourself, for example gender, marital status, health data, or any other information you would not want made public, such as your address or phone number, to any Monster site or application or to any public website
. You may adjust your visibility settings at any time by
signing into your Monster account
andselecting visibility settings. Private resumes will not be visible in Monster's resume and profile database. You may still use your private resume to apply online to a job.If you apply with a private resume, it will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy of it.
If you apply for a job and provide your contact information to express interest in a job, or if you respond to a communication from an employer, you agree that your information will be shared with the relevant employer and that you will be contacted by that employer for employment-related purposes.
We attempt to limit access to our resume and profile databases to legitimate users but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to these databases.Once your resume has been disclosed, Monster is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who accessed it. Accordingly,
you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public in your resume or profile.
If your resume includes the personal data of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have provided their details and that person has consented for you to do so.
You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret.
The security of your personal data is important to us. We utilize a variety of safeguards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. Monster takes appropriate measures to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. You can find additional information on conducting a safe job search in our
Security Center

You should be aware that resumes and profiles may be monitored by your current employer.
