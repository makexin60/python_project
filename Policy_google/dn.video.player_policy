An eScreen test does not check the appearance or foaming of the specimen. As a result, it‚Äôs easier to pass this test using synthetic urine. If you know you must drop for an eScreen, focus on getting a high-quality urine kit, like Quick Fix, and delivering it at the right temperature.The ultimate way to pass a urine test is by providing your personal, real human urine that‚Äôs clear of any signs of drug use. Of course, that‚Äôs not always a realistic possibility. You don‚Äôt want to sacrifice your weekend partying or favorite method of relaxation for the chance that your job will require a urinalysis.If you have advance notice of the test and the ability to stop using for a few weeks to get everything out of your system, then that‚Äôs the safest way to pass. Detox kits can help speed up this process. Moreover, body fat also plays an important role as weed sticks to your fat deposits. This means that if you have more body fat, it will take longer for your body to metabolize the drug. Other factors such as the level of THC in the marijuana, your hydration, and your metabolism also impact the drug test results. There are multiple drug tests for weed with varying levels of sensitivity. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each test to differentiate between them. Urine tests are non-invasive and simple to perform as all you have to do is give a sample of your urine. You can even order a urine test at home to test yourself. It has the following detection time frame: Weed lasts the longest in your hair ‚Äì blood vessels transport weed to your hair follicles.
