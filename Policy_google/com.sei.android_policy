“Sharing” means providing Personal Information to a third party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration.
We “share” certain Personal Information with third parties as defined under applicable law.
We also disclose certain Personal Information to third parties for purposes of "targeted advertising" as defined by applicable law.

If you use our Services, your information may be collected, stored, or otherwise processed in the United States or other countries where our Service Providers operate.

7-Eleven also reserves the right to use and disclose aggregated or deidentified information for any commercially reasonable purpose.  7-Eleven publicly commits to maintaining, using, and otherwise processing such aggregated or deidentified information in an aggregated or deidentified manner and will not attempt to, directly or indirectly, disaggregate or re-identify such information.
13. 7-Eleven Loyalty Programs
As part of our Services, you may voluntarily choose to participate in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program, such as the 7Rewards Program.  We collect and disclose your Personal Information as described in
Section 3
(“How We Disclose Personal Information”) in connection with your participation in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program.  We do not process sensitive personal information in connection with 7-Eleven Loyalty Programs. We may also engage with our Business Partners, such as social media networks, to help facilitate your participation in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program or provide you with program benefits, some of which may be personalized.
Please note that exercising your rights under
Section 16
(“Additional Notice - U.S. State Specific Privacy Rights (other than California)”) or
Section 17
(“Additional Notice for California Residents”), such as the right to delete or opt-out of the selling or sharing of Personal Information, may limit our ability to provide you with certain benefits or Services under a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program.  For example, if you request that we delete your personal details and profile information or opt-out of the selling or sharing of such data, we may not be able to provide you with personalized benefits or Services as part of the 7-Eleven Loyalty Program.  However, we will endeavor to provide you with non-personalized 7-Eleven Loyalty Program benefits, if possible, so long as you continue to be a member of the applicable 7-Eleven Loyalty Program.  If your request to exercise your rights under
Section 16
or
Section 17
will result in the loss of a benefit of a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program or will mean you cannot participate in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program, we will provide you with at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice before discontinuing your 7-Eleven Loyalty Program membership or benefit due to you exercising those rights.

We obtain the above categories of Personal Information from a variety of sources, which are described above in the section titled “
Personal Information We Collect
”.
(b) Business Purposes for which we Use, "Sell", or "Share" Personal Information
We use the Personal Information we obtain for our operational purposes, including all purposes notified to you in “
How We Use Personal Information
”. For clarity, our uses of Personal Information include all uses that constitute “business purposes” or “commercial purposes” under the California Consumer Privacy Act.
(c) Disclosures of Personal Information
Within the last 12 months, we have shared disclosed Personal Information in all or substantially all of the categories identified above for business purposes to the categories of third parties set forth in the above section titled “
How We Disclose Personal Information
” .
As is common practice among businesses that operate Internet websites and mobile apps, within the past 12 months, we and our Business Partners use tracking technologies to help us to understand our customers and visitors to the Services, to enhance your online experience, and customize our offerings in ways that may be deemed a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information under California law.  This includes working with third parties such as ad networks which collect Personal Information via tracking technologies to serve personalized advertisements on and off our Services, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement.  Under certain state laws, this may be considered to be a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information.  To the extent these activities amount to a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information under applicable law, see
Section 8
above for links by which you can opt out.
(d) Notice of Financial Incentive
As part of the 7-Eleven Loyalty Programs, 7-Eleven offers the 7REWARDS® Loyalty Program (the “
7Rewards Program
”) to consumers.  The material terms of the 7Rewards Program are contained in the
7Rewards Program Terms and Conditions
(“
7Rewards Terms & Conditions
”).  Participation in the 7Rewards Program is at all times subject to the 7Rewards Terms & Conditions, and we encourage you to read them prior to registering.  7Rewards Program participants may receive 7Rewards points for every dollar spent on qualifying purchases.  Points may also be earned in other ways available to 7Rewards Program members, such as by participating in periodic offers (like weekly deals), making regular purchases of select products, or by participating in surveys or other customer insight opportunities.  Accumulated points may be redeemed for purchases of eligible products.  7Rewards Program members may also be eligible for discounts on fuel purchases at participating 7-Eleven stores, as well as for certain other benefits like exclusive offers or punch programs that can earn free products at participating stores.
7-Eleven collects Personal Information in connection with providing the 7Rewards Program in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
In general, we may collect (i) identifiers and Personal Information under the California Consumer Records Act (name, email, phone number, address, zip code, date of birth, payment information); (ii) commercial information (account credentials, transaction records, points balance and history, records of 7Reward Program redemptions, records of participation in 7Rewards Program-related offers or promotions); (iii) Internet or other electronic network information (such as data reflecting your interaction with the 7-Eleven app, in-store technologies, or ads connected to the 7Rewards Program); (iv) geolocation data (if you allow your mobile device to collect your location); (v) audio or visual information (e.g., if you agree to record your response to surveys or other customer insight opportunities), and (vi) inferences drawn from any of the foregoing relating to consumers.
You opt-in to the 7Rewards Program by
creating a 7Rewards account
or when downloading the app.  You may also withdraw from the 7Rewards Program at any time within the app by using the “
Delete Account
” feature or by calling us at
1 (855) 711-5933
(use service code 711).  Please note, choosing to delete your Personal Information may result in the loss of some or all accumulated points, offers, and/or other rewards offered by the 7Rewards Program.
7-Eleven does not calculate a monetary value for the Personal Information it collects through the 7Rewards Program.  The value each 7Rewards Program member receives can vary substantially by individual, and depends on a number of variables such as (without limitation) (1) the extent to which members make qualifying purchases, (2) the extent to which members redeem points, (3) the extent to which members take advantage of fuel discounts and/or other offers and Rewards, (4) whether members are regular or occasional customers, and (5) whether members elect to participate in surveys, customer insight opportunities, or other points earning opportunities.
7-Eleven believes the value members receive from the 7Rewards Program through discounted prices and other benefits, less the expense to 7-Eleven resulting from the offering of products and benefits, is reasonably related to the value of Personal Information it collects through the 7Rewards Program.
(e) Your California Privacy Rights
Under California law, if you are a California resident, you have the following rights. We will honor requests received to the extent required by applicable law and within the time provided by law.
Right to Opt-Out:
You have the right to opt-out of the "sale" of your Personal Information and/or the "sharing" of your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

Right of Non-Discrimination:
Subject to applicable law, we will not discriminate against you because of your exercise of any of the above rights, or any other rights under California law. We may, however, charge different prices or rates, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by your Personal Information.

Please note that we cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity, or identity of the agent authorized to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you.
The requirements above do not apply if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney under the California Probate Code sections 4121 to 4130.

A “sale” of Personal Information under certain laws includes the exchange of Personal Information with a third party for not just monetary consideration but also other valuable consideration.  Based on this definition of “sale”, some of our interactions with third parties may be considered a “sale” under applicable law.  However, we only “sell” Personal Information in an aggregated manner, and do not “sell” Personal Information at the individual user level. We do not “sell” your first name, last name, phone number, or account username.
“Sharing” means providing Personal Information to a third party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration.
We “share” certain Personal Information with third parties as defined under applicable law.
We also disclose certain Personal Information to third parties for purposes of "targeted advertising" as defined by applicable law.

In Connection with a Change of Control.
We may transfer or disclose your Personal Information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company or other business transaction.

9. Location of Services
7-Eleven is based in the United States. We collect, process and store information in the United States and other countries, subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice. If you use our Services, your information may be collected, stored, or otherwise processed in the United States or other countries where our Service Providers operate. This may mean your Personal Information is collected in a country, or transferred to a country, that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as the country where you live. If so, your Personal Information will be subject to the laws of the country in which it is collected and/or to which it is transferred.
10. Do Not Track Signals
Your device and/or browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not want them to track your online activities. As of the effective date of this Privacy Notice, our Site, App and Services do not support such "Do Not Track" requests.
11. Security
7-Eleven implements reasonable security measures, procedures and practices in an effort to protect your Personal Information in our possession.  But note, given the inherently open nature of the Internet, 7-Eleven cannot guarantee that information transmitted between you and us will always remain secure.  We may also require you to assist us to safeguard your Personal Information.  For instance, if you create an account with our Services, you should use unique and strong passwords, not share your passwords with others, and take any other measures we may require under the terms & conditions applicable to the Service you use.  In addition, to the extent we provide your Personal Information to any third parties, we will request that they use reasonable security measures to protect your information in accordance with applicable law.
12. Aggregated or Deidentified Information
7-Eleven also reserves the right to use and disclose aggregated or deidentified information for any commercially reasonable purpose.  7-Eleven publicly commits to maintaining, using, and otherwise processing such aggregated or deidentified information in an aggregated or deidentified manner and will not attempt to, directly or indirectly, disaggregate or re-identify such information.
13. 7-Eleven Loyalty Programs
As part of our Services, you may voluntarily choose to participate in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program, such as the 7Rewards Program.  We collect and disclose your Personal Information as described in
Section 3
(“How We Disclose Personal Information”) in connection with your participation in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program.  We do not process sensitive personal information in connection with 7-Eleven Loyalty Programs. We may also engage with our Business Partners, such as social media networks, to help facilitate your participation in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program or provide you with program benefits, some of which may be personalized.
Please note that exercising your rights under
Section 16
(“Additional Notice - U.S. State Specific Privacy Rights (other than California)”) or
Section 17
(“Additional Notice for California Residents”), such as the right to delete or opt-out of the selling or sharing of Personal Information, may limit our ability to provide you with certain benefits or Services under a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program.  For example, if you request that we delete your personal details and profile information or opt-out of the selling or sharing of such data, we may not be able to provide you with personalized benefits or Services as part of the 7-Eleven Loyalty Program.  However, we will endeavor to provide you with non-personalized 7-Eleven Loyalty Program benefits, if possible, so long as you continue to be a member of the applicable 7-Eleven Loyalty Program.  If your request to exercise your rights under
Section 16
or
Section 17
will result in the loss of a benefit of a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program or will mean you cannot participate in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program, we will provide you with at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice before discontinuing your 7-Eleven Loyalty Program membership or benefit due to you exercising those rights.

17. Additional Notice to California Residents
This part of our Privacy Notice applies to consumers who reside in the State of California.
(a) Personal Information we collect about California Consumers

Personal Information We Collect
”. The Personal Information we have obtained includes the following:
Personal Identifiers
Personal information described in Cal. Civil Code Section 1798.80(e) (California’s Customer Records Statute)
Commercial and transaction information
Internet or other electronic network activity information
Geolocation data (as stated above, you can disable location data collection at any time in your device or browser settings)
Characteristics of protected classifications
Audio and visual information (e.g. from calls placed with customer service centers or recordings of audio or video survey responses or other customer insights opportunities)
Inferences drawn from any of the above-listed types of Personal Information
We obtain the above categories of Personal Information from a variety of sources, which are described above in the section titled “
Personal Information We Collect
”.
(b) Business Purposes for which we Use, "Sell", or "Share" Personal Information
We use the Personal Information we obtain for our operational purposes, including all purposes notified to you in “
How We Use Personal Information
”. For clarity, our uses of Personal Information include all uses that constitute “business purposes” or “commercial purposes” under the California Consumer Privacy Act.
(c) Disclosures of Personal Information
Within the last 12 months, we have shared disclosed Personal Information in all or substantially all of the categories identified above for business purposes to the categories of third parties set forth in the above section titled “
How We Disclose Personal Information
” .
As is common practice among businesses that operate Internet websites and mobile apps, within the past 12 months, we and our Business Partners use tracking technologies to help us to understand our customers and visitors to the Services, to enhance your online experience, and customize our offerings in ways that may be deemed a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information under California law.  This includes working with third parties such as ad networks which collect Personal Information via tracking technologies to serve personalized advertisements on and off our Services, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement.  Under certain state laws, this may be considered to be a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information.  To the extent these activities amount to a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information under applicable law, see
Section 8
above for links by which you can opt out.
(d) Notice of Financial Incentive
As part of the 7-Eleven Loyalty Programs, 7-Eleven offers the 7REWARDS® Loyalty Program (the “
7Rewards Program
”) to consumers.  The material terms of the 7Rewards Program are contained in the
7Rewards Program Terms and Conditions
(“
7Rewards Terms & Conditions
”).  Participation in the 7Rewards Program is at all times subject to the 7Rewards Terms & Conditions, and we encourage you to read them prior to registering.  7Rewards Program participants may receive 7Rewards points for every dollar spent on qualifying purchases.  Points may also be earned in other ways available to 7Rewards Program members, such as by participating in periodic offers (like weekly deals), making regular purchases of select products, or by participating in surveys or other customer insight opportunities.  Accumulated points may be redeemed for purchases of eligible products.  7Rewards Program members may also be eligible for discounts on fuel purchases at participating 7-Eleven stores, as well as for certain other benefits like exclusive offers or punch programs that can earn free products at participating stores.
7-Eleven collects Personal Information in connection with providing the 7Rewards Program in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
In general, we may collect (i) identifiers and Personal Information under the California Consumer Records Act (name, email, phone number, address, zip code, date of birth, payment information); (ii) commercial information (account credentials, transaction records, points balance and history, records of 7Reward Program redemptions, records of participation in 7Rewards Program-related offers or promotions); (iii) Internet or other electronic network information (such as data reflecting your interaction with the 7-Eleven app, in-store technologies, or ads connected to the 7Rewards Program); (iv) geolocation data (if you allow your mobile device to collect your location); (v) audio or visual information (e.g., if you agree to record your response to surveys or other customer insight opportunities), and (vi) inferences drawn from any of the foregoing relating to consumers.
You opt-in to the 7Rewards Program by
creating a 7Rewards account
or when downloading the app.  You may also withdraw from the 7Rewards Program at any time within the app by using the “
Delete Account
” feature or by calling us at
1 (855) 711-5933
(use service code 711).  Please note, choosing to delete your Personal Information may result in the loss of some or all accumulated points, offers, and/or other rewards offered by the 7Rewards Program.
7-Eleven does not calculate a monetary value for the Personal Information it collects through the 7Rewards Program.  The value each 7Rewards Program member receives can vary substantially by individual, and depends on a number of variables such as (without limitation) (1) the extent to which members make qualifying purchases, (2) the extent to which members redeem points, (3) the extent to which members take advantage of fuel discounts and/or other offers and Rewards, (4) whether members are regular or occasional customers, and (5) whether members elect to participate in surveys, customer insight opportunities, or other points earning opportunities.
7-Eleven believes the value members receive from the 7Rewards Program through discounted prices and other benefits, less the expense to 7-Eleven resulting from the offering of products and benefits, is reasonably related to the value of Personal Information it collects through the 7Rewards Program.

In Connection with a Change of Control.
We may transfer or disclose your Personal Information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company or other business transaction.

Section 16
or
Section 17
will result in the loss of a benefit of a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program or will mean you cannot participate in a 7-Eleven Loyalty Program, we will provide you with at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice before discontinuing your 7-Eleven Loyalty Program membership or benefit due to you exercising those rights.

”.
(b) Business Purposes for which we Use, "Sell", or "Share" Personal Information
We use the Personal Information we obtain for our operational purposes, including all purposes notified to you in “
How We Use Personal Information
”. For clarity, our uses of Personal Information include all uses that constitute “business purposes” or “commercial purposes” under the California Consumer Privacy Act.
(c) Disclosures of Personal Information
Within the last 12 months, we have shared disclosed Personal Information in all or substantially all of the categories identified above for business purposes to the categories of third parties set forth in the above section titled “
How We Disclose Personal Information
” .
As is common practice among businesses that operate Internet websites and mobile apps, within the past 12 months, we and our Business Partners use tracking technologies to help us to understand our customers and visitors to the Services, to enhance your online experience, and customize our offerings in ways that may be deemed a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information under California law.  This includes working with third parties such as ad networks which collect Personal Information via tracking technologies to serve personalized advertisements on and off our Services, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement.  Under certain state laws, this may be considered to be a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information.  To the extent these activities amount to a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information under applicable law, see
Section 8
above for links by which you can opt out.
(d) Notice of Financial Incentive
As part of the 7-Eleven Loyalty Programs, 7-Eleven offers the 7REWARDS® Loyalty Program (the “
7Rewards Program
”) to consumers.  The material terms of the 7Rewards Program are contained in the
7Rewards Program Terms and Conditions
(“
7Rewards Terms & Conditions
”).  Participation in the 7Rewards Program is at all times subject to the 7Rewards Terms & Conditions, and we encourage you to read them prior to registering.  7Rewards Program participants may receive 7Rewards points for every dollar spent on qualifying purchases.  Points may also be earned in other ways available to 7Rewards Program members, such as by participating in periodic offers (like weekly deals), making regular purchases of select products, or by participating in surveys or other customer insight opportunities.  Accumulated points may be redeemed for purchases of eligible products.  7Rewards Program members may also be eligible for discounts on fuel purchases at participating 7-Eleven stores, as well as for certain other benefits like exclusive offers or punch programs that can earn free products at participating stores.
7-Eleven collects Personal Information in connection with providing the 7Rewards Program in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
In general, we may collect (i) identifiers and Personal Information under the California Consumer Records Act (name, email, phone number, address, zip code, date of birth, payment information); (ii) commercial information (account credentials, transaction records, points balance and history, records of 7Reward Program redemptions, records of participation in 7Rewards Program-related offers or promotions); (iii) Internet or other electronic network information (such as data reflecting your interaction with the 7-Eleven app, in-store technologies, or ads connected to the 7Rewards Program); (iv) geolocation data (if you allow your mobile device to collect your location); (v) audio or visual information (e.g., if you agree to record your response to surveys or other customer insight opportunities), and (vi) inferences drawn from any of the foregoing relating to consumers.
You opt-in to the 7Rewards Program by
creating a 7Rewards account
or when downloading the app.  You may also withdraw from the 7Rewards Program at any time within the app by using the “
Delete Account
” feature or by calling us at
1 (855) 711-5933
(use service code 711).  Please note, choosing to delete your Personal Information may result in the loss of some or all accumulated points, offers, and/or other rewards offered by the 7Rewards Program.
7-Eleven does not calculate a monetary value for the Personal Information it collects through the 7Rewards Program.  The value each 7Rewards Program member receives can vary substantially by individual, and depends on a number of variables such as (without limitation) (1) the extent to which members make qualifying purchases, (2) the extent to which members redeem points, (3) the extent to which members take advantage of fuel discounts and/or other offers and Rewards, (4) whether members are regular or occasional customers, and (5) whether members elect to participate in surveys, customer insight opportunities, or other points earning opportunities.
7-Eleven believes the value members receive from the 7Rewards Program through discounted prices and other benefits, less the expense to 7-Eleven resulting from the offering of products and benefits, is reasonably related to the value of Personal Information it collects through the 7Rewards Program.
