Privacy Policy
Introduction
Compleasy has developed the Unit Converter app as a freemium service. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our Service.
By choosing to use our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The information we collect is used to improve our Service and is handled as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
We collect non-personal data for the purpose of improving our Service. This includes:
Usage Data
Analytics Data
Crash Data
Certain features of our app, such as the compass or Qibla direction, may require access to your deviceâ€™s location. This is used only to provide these specific services and is done with your consent.
Purpose of Data Collection
The data we collect is used solely to:
Improve the functionality and user experience of our app.
Diagnose and fix issues related to app crashes.
Understand user interaction with the app to enhance future development.
Display relevant advertisements to support the free version of the app.
Third-Party Services
Our app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These include:
Google Play Services
Firebase Analytics
AdMob
Data Storage and Security
All data collected by the app is stored on your device. We do not store any user data on our servers or in the cloud.
While no method of electronic storage is completely secure, we implement commercially acceptable means to protect the non-personal data we collect. However, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
User Rights and Choices
Since we do not store any personal data, there is no need for users to access, update, or delete their data. The non-personal data used for analytics and crash reporting is not tied to any individual user and thus cannot be accessed or altered by users.
Users can opt out of data collection by uninstalling the app. Additionally, our app complies with GDPR requirements, including a consent pop-up provided by Google for users to manage their data preferences.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies
Our app itself does not use cookies. However, third-party services integrated into our app, such as analytics and advertising providers, may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect and use data to improve their services.
Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share your data with any third parties except those mentioned above for the purposes of analytics, crash reporting, and advertising. These third parties are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purposes.
Legal Compliance
We comply with relevant data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our GDPR compliance includes a consent mechanism where users can choose their data preferences.
Childrens Privacy
Our services do not target or collect data from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13, we will delete this information immediately. Parents or guardians who become aware of their child providing us with personal data should contact us so we can take appropriate action.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Users are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Changes are effective immediately after being posted on this page.
