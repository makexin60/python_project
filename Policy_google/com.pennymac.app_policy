We may collect non-personal information by using cookies and pixel tags. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer’s hard drive. It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally.
A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our website but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
You may set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether or not to accept it. However, some of the features available on the site may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

We also use third-party cookies – which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the website you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts. More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:

We use the information we get from these tools only to improve this site. Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of these tools with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics plant a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google or Adobe.

We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Online Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
Your Internet browser may offer a ‘Do Not Track’ feature allowing you to tell us you want to opt out of tracking for some purposes. We may not separately respond to or take any action in response to a ‘Do Not Track’ setting in your Internet browser.
We may provide links to third party sites, such as credit bureaus, service providers or merchants. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by Pennymac, you should review their privacy and security policies and other terms and conditions, as they may be different from those of our Sites. Pennymac does not guarantee and is not responsible for the privacy or security of these sites, including the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of their information.
Pennymac uses information described in this Notice to help advertise our products and services, including prescreened offers of credit, in a variety of ways. We use such information to present tailored ads, to you, analyze the effectiveness of our ads, and determine whether you might be interested in new products or services.
Relationship based advertising: In order to help make our advertising informative and useful, we may use information about your relationship with us to help determine which advertisements or offers to present to you.
Online Behavioral Advertising: We may use third party advertising companies to provide targeted display advertisements, likely to be of greater interest to you, through participating publishers and advertisers. To learn more about online behavioral advertising or to opt out of this type of advertising on many sites, please visit the
Network Advertising Initiative.
Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from Pennymac. Opting out from a specific third party site means that the ads you receive will not be based on your choices or behavior.

If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access our Site or other sites from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again.

Pennymac is committed to respecting and protecting consumers’ rights to privacy and to ensuring compliance with applicable law. Pennymac utilizes the telephone as a means of communicating with and promoting our products and services to our customers and to potential customers. Staying in contact and establishing a good relationship with the community is a critical part of our success. Consistent with applicable law, it is our policy to cease placing telemarketing calls to any person who has indicated a desire not to receive such calls. Accordingly, Pennymac has implemented procedures to honor consumers’ do-not-call requests in accordance with applicable state and federal law and has instituted internal training to ensure awareness of and compliance with this policy.
Consumers who wish to be added to our internal Do-Not-Call list may do so by calling us at 866-601-3518.
Upon completion of the do-not-call request, the consumer’s telephone number will be added to our Do-Not-Call list within thirty (30) days of the request. The consumer’s telephone number will remain on our Do-Not-Call list for at least five (5) years unless the consumer consents to telemarketing contact prior to the expiration of the five-year period. Consumers must notify us of any changes in name or telephone number if they move or wish to place a new telephone number on our Do-Not-Call list. Do-not-call requests are number-specific – consumers who have more than one telephone line that they wish to add to our Do-Not-Call list must notify us of such additional telephone lines.
This Online Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time. If we make any changes, we will post the revised policy on this page with a new “Effective Date.” Any changes to this Online Privacy Policy will become effective when posted unless indicated otherwise. Your use of the site following these changes means that you accept the revised Online Privacy Policy.

We adopt this privacy policy to comply with the CCPA, and it applies solely to persons who reside in the State of California (“consumer” or “you”).
The CCPA provides California residents with privacy rights related to the personal information businesses collected about you and your household. The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide you with a description of our business practices regarding the collection, use, sale, sharing, and retention of your personal information and of your rights regarding your personal information.

Exceptions:
The CCPA contains certain exceptions. For example, privacy rights established under the CCPA (including the right to know and right to delete) do not apply to personal information collected or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides California residents, including employees and contractors, with privacy rights related to the personal information businesses collected about you and your household. The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide you with a description of our business practices regarding the collection, use, sale, sharing, and retention of your personal information and of your rights regarding your personal information.
Under the CCPA, you have the right to know what personal information Pennymac collects, uses, sells, shares, retains, the right to correct inaccurate personal information, the right to request the deletion of your personal information collected, and the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. However, these rights only extend to information covered by the CCPA, and because the CCPA does not cover all consumer information in all scenarios, only certain information is subject to the above referenced rights.

This Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (“OCPA”) Privacy Policy supplements the information contained in PennyMac Loan Services, LLC (“Pennymac”)’s online “Privacy Policy” for PennyMac Loan Services, LLC and its affiliates with Pennymac in its name (collectively, “Pennymac”, “we,” “us,” “our”).
We adopt this privacy policy to comply with the OCPA, and it applies solely to consumers who reside in the State of Oregon (“consumer” or “you”) and act in any capacity other than in a commercial or employment context.
The OCPA provides Oregon consumers with privacy rights related to the personal information businesses processed about you and your household. The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide you with a description of our business practices regarding the processing of your personal information and of your rights regarding your personal information.
Under the OCPA, you have the right to know what personal information Pennymac processed, a list of specific third parties to which Pennymac may have disclosed personal information, specific personal information processed by Pennymac, correct inaccuracies in personal information, delete personal information about you, and opt out from processing your personal information for targeted advertising or profiling you in furtherance of decisions that produce legal effects or effects of similar significance. However, these rights only extend to information covered by the OCPA, and because the OCPA does not cover all consumer information in all scenarios, only certain information is subject to the above referenced rights.
Exceptions:
The OCPA contains certain exceptions. For example, privacy rights established under the OCPA (including the right to know and right to delete) do not apply to personal information collected or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
