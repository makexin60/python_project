Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We (and our service providers) use
                different technologies to collect information, including cookies and web beacons and other tracking mechanisms. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in your device memory that help us improve our Services and your
                experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons
                (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") are electronic images that may be used
                in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and help us understand usage and campaign
                effectiveness. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see

Information Collected from Other Sources
We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may collect

            We also collect information from publicly available sources, including information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog,
            chat room, or social media). If you apply for a job with us, we will receive your application information from our job applicant
            processing partners. Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a social media site or app, we may have access

            identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites
            and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time
            spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by
            PetSmart and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain
            content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and
            better understand your online activity. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of
            having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit

            also include a feature ("Allow Apps to Request to Track" on iOS or "Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads" or
            "Opt Out of Ads Personalization" on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain
            information collected through apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.
Data Retention and Security
Data Retention
We keep the personal information we collect about you for as long as necessary
            to carry out the purposes in this Privacy Policy or any other notice provided at the time of collection,
            such as providing products or services to you, supporting our business functions and operations, enabling
            us to communicate with you, providing marketing and personalization, conducting research, making data-driven
            business decisions about new offerings, satisfying our legal, tax, regulatory, compliance, or contractual
            obligations, and resolving disputes. Where required, we will dispose of the information we collect when
            we no longer need it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or any other notice provided at
            the time of collection, in accordance with PetSmart’s retention policies and procedures.
Criteria we use to determine these retention periods include:

Data Security
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your
            personal information. However, no e-commerce solution or website is completely secure. You are also
            responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information, such as using strong passwords
            and using different passwords across your online accounts. We will never request your password or
            credit card information through email.

            home jurisdiction.
