PRIVACY POLICY
Last modified: 12/12/2024
Welcome to the IRIS Privacy Policy. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.
The IRIS Service is comprised of both an App and a Website (collectively, the “Service”). This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the Service and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. This policy also describes how we might use your information to contact you and what options you have regarding the personal information you provide us.
What does this policy cover?
This policy applies to the Service the Company provides. Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Service. By accessing or using this Service, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see "Changes in Our Privacy Policy"). Your continued use of this Service after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
Children Under the Age of 18
The App is not intended for children under 18 years of age. No one under age 18 may provide any personal information to or on the Service. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at support@irisdating.com.

We collect information from and about users of our Service:
Directly from you when you provide it.
Automatically when you use the Service.
From third-party sources, including social media platforms.
Information You Provide to Us
When you use our Service, we may ask you to provide information:
By which you may be personally identified, such as name, email address, postal address, telephone number, payment information, or other identifiers.
That is about you but individually does not identify you, such as demographic information, interests, or preferences.
Profile information, including a real-time photo of your face for verification purposes.
Chat messages and interactions with other users.
Automatic Data Collection Technologies
We may use technologies like cookies, web beacons, and mobile device identifiers to collect:
Usage Details: Logs, traffic data, and resources accessed.
Device Information: Device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.
Location Information: Real-time location data.
You can manage these technologies through your device or browser settings. Note that disabling them may limit some features of the Service.

We use the information we collect about you to:
Provide and manage your account.
Facilitate interactions and matches with other users.
Improve and personalize the Service.
Communicate updates, including policy changes or service disruptions.
Comply with legal obligations.
Disclosure of Your Information
We may disclose personal information:
To contractors, service providers, and affiliates who support our operations.
During business transfers, such as mergers or acquisitions.
To comply with legal obligations or protect our rights.
We may also share aggregated or anonymized data that does not identify any individual without restriction.
Data Security
We have implemented security measures to protect your personal information. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials.
Your Choices About Your Information
You have the right to:
Access and correct your information by logging into your account.
Delete your account, which removes your data following a one-year safety retention period.
Opt-out of marketing communications.
Control location data collection through your device settings.
Cross-Border Transfers
Depending on where you are located, sometimes your information may be subject to cross-border transfers. IRIS is intended for use by US residents.  But, if you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), your personal information will be transferred outside of the EEA, for instance, to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. IF YOU ARE AN EU RESIDENT AND YOU PROVIDE INFORMATION TO IRIS, THEN YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. YOU ARE ALSO CONSENTING TO OUR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT IRIS PROVIDES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
Data Subject Rights
For EU residents, Chapter 3 of the GDPR provides states you have eight rights. These are:
The right to be informed; This means anyone processing your personal data must make clear what they are processing, why, and who else the data may be passed to.
The right of access; this is your right to see what data is held about you by a Data Controller.
The right to rectification; the right to have your data corrected or amended if what is held is incorrect in some way.
The right to erasure; under certain circumstances you can ask for your personal data to be deleted. This is also called ‘the Right to be Forgotten’. This would apply if the personal data is no longer required for the purposes it was collected for, or your consent for the processing of that data has been withdrawn, or the personal data has been unlawfully processed.
The right to restrict processing; this gives the Data Subject the right to ask for a temporary halt to processing of personal data, such as in the case where a dispute or legal case has to be concluded, or the data is being corrected.
The right to data portability; a Data Subject has the right to ask for any data supplied directly to the Data Controller by him or her, to be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
The right to object; the Data Subject has the right to object to further processing of their data which is inconsistent with the primary purpose for which it was collected, including profiling, automation, and direct marketing.
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling; Data Subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.
IRIS is intended for use by US or North American residents.  Therefore, although we may use reasonable efforts to provide the eight rights listed above, we cannot guarantee that we will do so.
