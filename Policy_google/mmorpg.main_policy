Kakele is a classic 2D MMORPG inspired on classic RPG games. We try to gather the best game experience from all the classic RPGs in a single game, Kakele! In Kakele you spend your time fighting monsters, exploring the world, finding treasure chests, making alliances or declaring wars against others. A game trivia: people donâ€™t usually pronounce the game name right. The last letter, e, should be the strongest one, just like in â€˜PelÃ©â€™, the best football player of all time ðŸ™‚
Terms and Policies
Appeals
If you were banned or got a warning, you may appeal it. Notice that an appeal does not guarantee that the rule enforcement will be reverted, only that a staff member will manually inspect your case and argument. Our systems issue automatic bans, and our staff sometimes issue manual bans. We donâ€™t get it right all the time, for that reason you may appeal your case.
To appeal the ban or warning issued on your account, please send us an email with all the information you can, stating your case and why it should be reverted. We generally do not reply to appeals. If we decide to revert a rule enforcement, we will not notify you either.
