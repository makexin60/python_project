We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect
        information submitted to us, both during transmission and after we receive the information. However, no method
        of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. Therefore, while we
        strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
        security.

        applicable national data protection laws. Any applicable national data protection laws will supersede this
