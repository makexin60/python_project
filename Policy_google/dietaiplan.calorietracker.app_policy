Images are used for identifying and logging food items. Camera access can be managed and revoked at any time through your device settings. By using this feature, you consent to our processing of these images as described.
For explaining the some terms above more in depth, we wanted to write the following further explanations. Collected means that this data is transmitted off the user's device, either to you (the developer) or a third party. This includes data that is processed ephemerally, or stored for longer. Shared means that this data is transferred to a third party, either on or off the user's device. Processing data "ephemerally" means accessing and using data while it is only stored in memory, and is retained for no longer than necessary to service the specific request in real-time.  App functionality means that used for features in your app. For example, to enable functionality, or authenticate users. Analytics means that used to collect data about how users use your app, or how your app performs. For example, to see how many users are using a particular feature, to monitor app health, to diagnose and fix bugs or crashes, or to make future performance improvements. Personalization means that used to customize your app, such as showing recommended content or suggestions. For example, suggesting playlists based on users' listening habits, or delivering local news based on a user's location. Account management means that used for the setup or management of user accounts. For example, to enable users to create accounts; to add information to accounts you provide, for use across your services; to log in to your app; or to verify their credentials.
The app does use third party services that may collect
                    information used to identify you.
