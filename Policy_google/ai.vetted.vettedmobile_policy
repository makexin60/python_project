Vetted AI's Services enable you to connect and interact with various third-party platforms and social networks, such as Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and other social media services. These integrations allow you to engage with our content across different platforms and share your experiences with other users.
How Social Features Work
Our social features enable seamless interaction between Vetted AI's Services and your preferred social platforms. You can access our official pages on various social networks, engage with our content through actions like 'liking' or 'sharing,' and connect our Services with your social media accounts. These features are designed to enhance your experience and make it easier to stay connected with our community.
Information Sharing and Visibility
When you utilize these social features, it's important to understand that your interactions may extend beyond Vetted AI's direct control. Information you post or share through these features may be publicly displayed on the third-party platform, and both Vetted AI and the social media service may have access to information about you and your usage patterns across both services. This shared access helps us provide a better integrated experience but also means your information exists in multiple environments.
Privacy Considerations
The integration between Vetted AI and third-party platforms is governed by multiple privacy frameworks. While we maintain strict control over information within our Services, any information shared through social features becomes subject to the third party's privacy practices, terms of service, and data retention policies. This means that content you share or interactions you make may persist on these platforms according to their specific policies.
Managing Your Privacy
We encourage you to make informed decisions about using social features with our Services. Consider reviewing the privacy settings on your social media accounts and understanding how your interactions will be visible to others. Remember that third-party platforms have their own privacy policies and practices that will apply to any information you share through these integrations.
For more comprehensive information about how third-party services handle your data, please refer to our section on Third Party Websites and Links, as well as the respective privacy policies of each platform you use in conjunction with our Services. Your careful consideration of these relationships helps ensure your information is shared only in ways you intend.
Vetted AI's Services may contain links to external websites and platforms, including social media services like Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter). While these links enhance your experience, any interaction with these third-party sites falls under their respective privacy notices and terms. We do not control or maintain responsibility for the privacy practices, security measures, or content found on these external platforms.
Information you choose to share on public or semi-public venues, including third-party social networking platforms, may be visible to other users of both our Services and these platforms without restrictions on its use. Providing links to these platforms does not constitute an endorsement of their content, owners, or operators.
We encourage you to review each platform's privacy notice and terms before sharing your information or engaging with their services. Your interaction with these third-party sites is governed by their respective policies, not by Vetted AI's Privacy Notice.

While Vetted AI implements robust security measures to protect your information, we acknowledge that no digital security system is completely impenetrable. When you transmit information to us electronically through our Services, please be aware that its security during transit cannot be guaranteed. We recommend against sending sensitive or confidential information through unsecured channels.
We retain your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice. Our retention periods are determined by several factors, including ongoing Service requirements, legal obligations, dispute resolution needs, contract enforcement, harm prevention, and security maintenance. This approach ensures we balance your privacy rights with our operational requirements and legal responsibilities.
This section applies specifically to residents of California and other U.S. states with similar privacy laws to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For clarity, "personal information" in this section includes "sensitive personal information" as defined by the CCPA.

Over the past 12 months, Vetted AI has collected and processed personal information for business purposes across our corporate group and through service providers. This information includes basic identifiers like names and email addresses, customer records, commercial information, network activity data, geolocation data, and professional information.

Special Rights for California Minors
California residents under 18 who have registered for our Services can request removal of their publicly posted content. To do so, contact us with details about the content and its location.

When you use our Services, your information may be transferred to, stored in, or accessed from countries outside your jurisdiction, including by our service providers and support teams.

‍
Transfer Safeguards
For transfers of data outside the UK and European Economic Area (EEA), we implement appropriate safeguards, including the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses or UK-approved equivalent mechanisms. These safeguards apply unless the recipient country has been deemed to provide adequate protection by relevant authorities. You may request information about these transfer mechanisms by contacting us.

EU-U.S. and UK Data Privacy Framework
For users in the EU and UK:
Vetted AI complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and its UK Extension (DPF). We adhere to the DPF Principles when processing personal data received from these regions. The DPF Principles take precedence over this privacy notice where conflicts exist regarding covered information.
The Federal Trade Commission oversees our DPF compliance. We accept responsibility for onward transfers to third parties and commit to resolving DPF-related complaints about our data practices. EU and UK residents with privacy concerns should first contact us directly. For unresolved complaints, you may access free dispute resolution through the Data Privacy Framework website. Under certain conditions, binding arbitration may be available.
We cooperate with EU data protection authorities and the UK Information Commissioner's Office regarding unresolved DPF complaints. You can find more information about the Data Privacy Framework program and view our certification on the official Data Privacy Framework website.
