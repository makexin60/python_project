Possible takes technical and organizational measures to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. These measures vary depending on the sensitivity of the information we have collected from you.

6. How We Store and Protect Your Information
Possible takes technical and organizational measures to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. These measures vary depending on the sensitivity of the information we have collected from you. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is absolutely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Possible is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third-party.
To protect your privacy and security, we take steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Possible, at all times. Do not share your password with anyone and do limit your access to your computer or other devices by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.For information about how to protect yourself against identity theft, please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at
www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/identity-theft-and-data-security.

Following termination or deactivation of your User account, Possible may retain your profile information and User Content for an additional period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. In certain circumstances, we are required by Federal and State regulations to store various information.

In addition, you agree that we are not responsible for, and we do not have control over, any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content.
